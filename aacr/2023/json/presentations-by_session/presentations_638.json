[{"Abstract":"Overcoming ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2)-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR) has attracted the attention of scientists because one of the critical factors leading to MDR is the overexpression of ABCG2. Identification of novel chemotherapeutic reagents as inhibitors of ABCG2 has been considered an effective strategy. RN486, a Bruton&#8217;s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitor, was discovered to potentially reverse ABCB1-mediated MDR. In this study, we reported that RN486 effectively antagonizes ABCG2-mediated MDR in cancer cells. Non-toxic concentrations of RN486 remarkably increased the sensitivity of ABCG2-overexpressing cancer cells to conventional anticancer drugs mitoxantrone and topotecan. The reversal mechanistic studies showed that RN486 increased the accumulation and decreased the efflux of ABCG2 substrate drug in ABCG2-overexpressing cancer cells. In addition, the inhibitory effect of RN486 on ABCG2-associated ATPase activity was also verified. Docking analysis indicated a strong binding between RN486 and ABCG2 transporter. Meanwhile, the ABCG2 subcellular localization was not altered by the treatment of RN486, but the expression level of ABCG2 was down-regulated. Taken together, our studies suggest that RN486 can antagonize ABCG2-mediated MDR in cancer cells via down-regulating the expression level of ABCG2 protein, reducing ATPase activity of ABCG2 transporter, and inhibiting the transporting function. RN486 could be potentially used in combination with chemotherapy against ABCG2-mediated MDR in cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ABCG2,RN486,Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Multidrug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xing-Duo Dong<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Qisi Lu<sup>2<\/sup>, Yi-Dong Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Qiu-Xu Teng<sup>1<\/sup>, Zi-Ning Lei<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhe-Sheng Chen<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>St. John's University, Queens, NY,<sup>2<\/sup>Foresea Life Insurance Guangzhou General Hospital, Guangzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3d01a3e7-e158-49b6-b7b7-1d79382b090a","ControlNumber":"6854","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>X.

Previously, it has been suggested that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling is down-regulated during the prostate cancer progression from the early androgen-sensitive stage to the metastatic castration-resistant stage. However, no literature reports are available for BMP signaling in the more advanced-chemoresistant prostate cancer. In this study, we found the expression levels of the BMP type I receptor members, Activin-like kinase-2 (ALK2) and Activin-like kinase-3 (ALK3), were significantly higher in the chemoresistant prostate cancer cells than those in the chemosensitive prostate cancer cells. In addition, the phospho-Smad1\/5\/9 proteins, the pivotal intracellular effectors of the BMP signaling, were notably elevated in the chemoresistant prostate cancer cells over the chemosensitive prostate cancer cells, indicating that BMP signaling is highly activated in the chemoresistant prostate cancer cells. We also found that BMP signaling inhibition with either DMH1 or the knockdown of ALK2\/ALK3 sensitized chemoresistant prostate cancer cells to the chemotherapy drug docetaxel in a dose dependent manner. Our further study indicates that DMH1 suppressed the migration and invasion of chemoresistant prostate cancer cells <i>in vitro<\/i>, and attenuated chemoresistant prostate tumor growth in the mouse xenograft model <i>in vivo<\/i>. In addition, we showed that DMH1 disrupted the sphere formation in DU145-TxR and PC3-TxR cells, suppressed the expression of marker genes of the cancer stem cells (CSCs), and inhibited the efflux activity of multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (P-gp1). In conclusion, our study demonstrates that BMP signaling is associated with prostate cancer chemoresistance and BMP signaling inhibition effectively overcomes the cancer chemoresistance potentially through the disruption of CSCs&#8217; stemness and P-gp1 efflux activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Chemoresistance,Bone morphogenetic proteins,Xenografts,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jijun Hao<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chen Xie<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhijun Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Yong Bar<sup>3<\/sup>, Jose Aguilar<sup>1<\/sup>, Austin Kyan<sup>1<\/sup>, Li Zhing<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Marshall B.

PDT kills cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced by interaction between cellular O<sub>2 <\/sub>and an excited photosensitizer (PS) by a specific light. One of the most used PS in dermatology is Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) and its precursor methyl aminolevulinate (MAL). MAL enters into cells and is converted to PpIX by enzymes of the heme group synthesis pathway. The insertion of ferrous iron into PpIX forms a heme molecule, which has no PS action. A previous study shows that efficacy of PDT, in resistant cells, can be improved by addition of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a green tea polyphenol. Therefore, the aim of this work is to evaluate the rol of EGCG on PPIX synthesis.<br \/>Material and methods: It was used a A-431 cell line from skin squamous cell carcinoma. The EC<sub>50<\/sub> of EGCG was determined by MTT assay after 24 hours. Clonogenic assay was carried out using EGCG 10, 20 and 40 &#956;M, for 4 and 24 hours of incubation. To evaluate PpIX and ROS, A-431 cells were exposed to EGCG (10, 20, 40 &#956;M) with or without MAL 2 mM. After 4 hours, some plates were irradiated with red light to generate ROS. PpIX and ROS were detected by flow cytometry. Gene expression of enzymes of heme synthesis was analyzed by RT-qPCR. Intracellular iron was measured using a commercial kit. &#65279;<br \/>Results: EC<sub>50<\/sub> determined a concentration of 50 &#956;M of EGCG at 24 hours. EGCG concentrations from 10 &#956;M reduced cell clonogenic capacity, even with only 4 hours of incubation. A-431 cells show PDT resistance with MAL 2 mM and a fluence of 4 J\/cm<sup>2<\/sup>. The addition of EGCG to MAL-PDT showed a decrement of cell viability with an increase of PpIX and ROS. Besides, incubation with EGCG for 4 hours, triggered an increment of HMBS enzyme and decrease of FECH. In addition, EGCG reduced intracellular iron concentrations.<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>These findings show that EGCG has a PDT enhancing effect, decreasing intracellular iron levels and modulating gene expression of heme synthesis enzymes, which are directly related with high levels of PpIX production and ROS levels, causing the death of resistant cells.Acknowledgements: Postdoctoral FONDECYT N&#186; 3210618, IDeA I+D FONDEF ID21I10027","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Squamous cell carcinoma,Skin,Photodynamic therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Daniela León<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Álvaro Gutiérrez<sup>1<\/sup>, Helga Weber<sup>2<\/sup>, Ramón Silva<sup>3<\/sup>, María Elena Reyes<sup>1<\/sup>, Tamara Viscarra<sup>1<\/sup>, Kurt Buchegger<sup>4<\/sup>, Carmen Ili<sup>1<\/sup>, Priscilla Brebi<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Laboratorio de Biología Integrativa.

Furthermore, P-gp plays an important role in drug disposition, pharmacokinetics, and drug development. Thus, P-gp transporter expression, function, and modulation of MDR in human cancers have been extensively studied. In spite of significant progress in understanding P-gp, <i>ABCB1<\/i> regulation and its impact on clinical trials remain unclear. Through sequential exposure of SUM159PT to paclitaxel, we created a paclitaxel resistant triple negative breast cancer cell line SUM159PT-PAC200. We observed a significant increase in the phosphorylation of the mitochondrial fission protein dynamin related protein kinase 1 (Drp1) at Ser616 and its upstream kinase ERK1\/2a of Drp1. Through the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we knocked out the gene encoding Drp1 in PAC200. When Drp1 is genetically abated (PAC200 Drp1<sup>-\/-<\/sup>), paclitaxel resistance is significantly reversed. It was also observed that clonogenicity under paclitaxel pressure was significantly decreased in both the PAC200\/Drp1<sup>-\/-<\/sup> line and the partial KO Drp1<sup>-\/+<\/sup> line, compared to the PAC200 line. Parallelly, a significant increase in the expression of P-gp transporters was also observed in the PAC200 cell line. As a surprise, genetically targeting Drp1 in PAC200 cells (i.e., PAC200 Drp1\/KO) reduced P-gp expression to virtually undetectable levels. Until now, there has been no description of how Drp1 and P-gp are related. Furthermore, PAC200 Drp1\/KO cells showed reduced proliferation, migration, and invasion potential, while their soft agar clonogenic capacities were almost nonexistent, suggesting that Drp1 plays a key role in breast cancer proliferation and dissemination. It appears that modulating or targeting Drp1 might be a useful strategy for modulating P-gp in the development and maintenance of the cancer's MDR phenotype, proliferation, and invasion. Understanding how mitochondrial dynamics determine the transactivation and coordination of drug-resistant P-gp phenotypes would make Drp1 an attractive molecular target for cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"P-glycoprotein,Mitochondria,MDR1,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>David Terrero<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Saloni Malla<sup>1<\/sup>, Dayanidhi Raman<sup>1<\/sup>, Jayachandra Babu<sup>2<\/sup>, Amit Tiwari<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Toledo, Toledo, OH,<sup>2<\/sup>Auburn University, Auburn, AL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"052bcaad-a68f-4500-adb2-dba88a41307e","ControlNumber":"8140","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

However, therapy resistance and modest responses are the leading causes of failure for targeted therapies. To address this pressing clinical need, we sought to identify drugs that would enhance the efficacy of PI3K inhibitors. We tested 5768 drugs (0-1&#181;M) with diverse targets in&nbsp;<i>NOTCH1&nbsp;<\/i>mutant (<i>NOTCH1<\/i><i><sup>MUT<\/sup><\/i>&nbsp;- HN31, UMSCC22A, PCI-15B) HNSCC cell lines and copanlisib acquired resistant (CAR) HN31 clones. We determined drug efficacy using two metrics-area over the curve lethal dose (AOC_LD&#62;0, cytotoxic) and area under the growth curve (AUC_GRI&#60;0.9, cytostatic). These metrics are more robust than IC<sub>50<\/sub>&nbsp;values as they use the normalized growth rate inhibition curve and avoid the confounding effect of the rate of cell division. Of 306 drug classes, 100 were effective with at least one drug being cytotoxic or cytostatic in at least one cell line. PLK inhibitors were the most effective class of drugs against&nbsp;<i>NOTCH1<\/i><i><sup>MUT<\/sup><\/i>&nbsp;HNSCC cell lines (87% effective - 12 cytotoxic, 2 cytostatic, 2 ineffective). We further tested the PLK1-specific inhibitor onvansertib (0-100nM) combined with pan-PI3K inhibitor copanlisib (0-200nM) or dual inhibitor bimiralisib (0-1&#956;M). We observed robust decreases in cell numbers at very low drug concentrations (50nM) with the combinations. We validated these results&nbsp;<i>in vitro<\/i>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<i>NOTCH1<\/i><i><sup>MUT<\/sup><\/i>,&nbsp;<i>NOTCH1<\/i><i><sup>WT<\/sup><\/i>, CAR&nbsp;<i>NOTCH1<\/i><i><sup>MUT<\/sup><\/i>&nbsp;HNSCC models, and HEK293 by using independent approaches to test for apoptosis. A significant increase in cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase 3, and Annexin V\/PI staining (<u>&#62;<\/u>2x), was evident when PI3K and PLK1 were concurrently inactivated as compared to single agent treatment in HNSCC models. Furthermore, HEK293 cells were unaffected at these doses. We then investigated the role of PLK1 following PI3K inhibition in HNSCC models and found PLK1 protein levels to be downregulated. As PLK1 is downstream of Aurora kinases, we further determined the phospho-PLK1 (p-PLK1) levels in HNSCC models.

Clinical trials on the use of sotorasib for cancer treatment have demonstrated promising results. However, KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>-mutant cancers can acquire resistance to sotorasib after treatment. Most of the drug resistance mechanisms converge on reactivation of the MAPK pathway to bypass KRAS inhibition (Adachi, Ito et al. 2020, Ryan, Fece de la Cruz et al. 2020, Xue, Zhao et al. 2020, Zhao, Murciano-Goroff et al. 2021, Liu, Kang et al. 2022). Identifying the underlying drug resistance mechanisms is critical for improving treatment response and developing more effective combination strategies. During study on the mechanisms underlying sotorasib resistance, we incidentally found that when cultured in sotorasib-free medium,<i> <\/i>KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup><i>-<\/i>mutant cancer cells adopted to sotorasib demonstrated a decreased growth rate and increased cell death. A similar &#8220;drug addiction&#8221; phenomenon was noted in<i> <\/i>BRAF-mutant cells treated with BRAF or MEK inhibitors (Das Thakur, Salangsang et al. 2013, Moriceau, Hugo et al. 2015, Hong, Moriceau et al. 2018, Rao, Shi et al. 2020). Here, we first verified the death property induced by sotorasib withdrawal in sotorasib-resistant cells, and further explored the mechanism underlying sotorasib addiction. Finally, we provide a novel therapeutic strategy against sotorasib-addicted cells. In the results, we uncovered in the absence of sotorasib, the sotorasib-resistant cells underwent p21<sup>Waf1\/Cip1<\/sup>-mediated cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent cell death. Robust mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation after sotorasib withdrawal triggered severe DNA damage and replication stress, resulting in DNA damage response (DDR) activation. Persistent MAPK pathway hyperactivation concomitant with exhausted DDR eventually drove the premature entry of cells into mitosis and to aberrant mitosis, followed by micronucleus and nucleoplasmic bridge formation.

Nevertheless, clinical resistance emerges. The upregulation of the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR signaling pathway is one of the multiple acquired mechanisms of resistance to the CDK4\/6i and ET combination. Thus, the extensive crosstalk between the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR and ER pathways underlines the importance of targeting both pathways to overcome drug resistance in ER+\/HER2- BC. Here we have evaluated the antitumor activity of Elacestrant, the oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) and antagonist, in combination with the &#963;-sparing PI3K inhibitor MEN1611, in vitro and in vivo in different clinically relevant BC Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) models, resistant to CDK4\/6i and to ET, harboring mutations in PIK3CA and\/or ESR1 genes. In cell-based proliferation assays, the combination of Elacestrant and MEN1611 showed a synergistic effect in inhibiting the growth of ER+ BC cell lines. In vivo data in MCF7- and patient-derived xenograft models showed compelling antitumor activity using the combination at tolerable and clinically relevant doses, compared to the single agents. In the PDX HBxC-3, wild-type for PIK3CA and ESR1 genes, the Tumor Volume-Inhibition (TVI) was 56.2%, 48.7% and 71.7% for MEN1611, Elacestrant and the combination group, respectively. In this model, the combination showed improved anti-tumor activity in comparison to the single agent treatments. In the PDX models HBxC-19 and CTG-2308, wild-type for ESR1 gene, but harboring a PIK3CA mutation, the TVI of the combination was 94.6% and 61.4%, respectively. In the latter model the combination was significantly superior to the single agents. In the PDX model CTG-1260, with PIK3CA and ESR1 mutations, MEN1611 and Elacestrant single agent treatment showed tumor growth inhibition with TVIs of 63.2% and 52.3%, while the combination showed a significant TVI of 86.9%. Overall, in all the tested in vivo models the combination of Elacestrant and MEN1611 was superior in comparison to the single agents by overcoming resistance to ER inhibition potentially driven by PI3K pathway activation in PIK3CA mutated tumors. The current data support the use of Elacestrant, the first oral SERD with positive phase III results in the EMERALD trial (Bidard <i>et al.<\/i>; JCO 2022), in combination with the PI3K inhibitor MEN1611, in ER+\/HER2- mBC patients harboring PIK3CA mutations and who progressed to CDK4\/6i plus ET.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Estrogen receptor,PI3K,Breast cancer,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Giuseppe Merlino<sup><\/sup>, <b>Alessio Fiascarelli<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Simone Talucci<sup><\/sup>, Patrizia Tunici<sup><\/sup>, Mario Bigioni<sup><\/sup>, Alessandro Bressan<sup><\/sup>, Monica binaschi<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Menarini Ricerche S.p.A., Pomezia (Rome), Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"20288ae6-1a31-4d17-9a3b-83e48c121791","ControlNumber":"4236","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;G.

Bruton&#8217;s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitors are widely used in the clinic for treatment of patients with B cell malignancies. Acquired resistance mutations, however, can reduce or eliminate their efficacy and represent a growing challenge. Mutations at C481 dramatically reduce the binding of covalent BTK inhibitors, whereas other clinically-observed mutations such as V416L, T474I, and L528W reduce or eliminate the activity of next-generation non-covalent inhibitors. Some of these mutations abolish BTK kinase activity while retaining intact BCR signaling and BTK-dependent growth, indicating that mutant BTK elicits scaffold-mediated signaling essential for malignant B cell survival. To assess the impact of resistance mutations on the activity of BTK inhibitors, we generated a DLBCL line (TMD8) harboring BTK-C481S, V416L, T474I, or L528W point mutations. The C481S mutation eliminated the anti-proliferative effects of covalent inhibitors ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, and zanubrutinib, while the V416L, T474I, and L528W mutations dramatically reduced the activity of pirtobrutinib, vecabrutinib, and fenebrutinib. L528W largely abolished the activity of ibrutinib and zanubrutinib, whereas V416L substantially reduced the activity of acalabrutinib. This variability in BTK inhibitor sensitivity to resistance mutations complicates treatment decisions for patients who relapse on BTK inhibitors, necessitating agents that can more broadly target resistance mutations. Here we assessed the activity of NX-5948, a heterobifunctional degrader molecule that induces the targeted degradation of BTK. We used surface plasmon resonance to evaluate the binding of NX-5948 to WT and mutant (C481S, T474I, V416L and L528W) BTK proteins. NX-5948 binds potently to BTK WT, C481S and T474I with single-digit nanomolar affinities, but loses potency against the V416L (14-fold) and L528W (33-fold) mutants. Despite this reduction in binary binding affinity, NX-5948 induces sub-nanomolar degradation of all mutant forms of BTK and potently suppresses expression of activation markers and proliferation in TMD8 cells harboring these mutations. We propose that the positive cooperativity that NX-5948 induces between BTK and the E3 ligase cereblon contributes to its potent and sustained degradation activity against BTK resistance mutants. We also assessed the selectivity of NX-5948 by global proteomics and observed exquisite selectivity across cell types and conditions. The exceptional potency, selectivity, and activity of NX-5948 against BTK mutants warrant its investigation in clinical settings that develop diverse inhibitor resistance. A phase 1a\/b trial of NX-5948 for patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies is ongoing (NCT05131022).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BTK,Drug resistance,Drug discovery,Proteasome-mediated degradation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mark Andrew Noviski<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Nivetha Brathaban<sup><\/sup>, Ratul Mukerji<sup><\/sup>, Stephanie Yung<sup><\/sup>, Jordan Ye<sup><\/sup>, Hugo Bousquet<sup><\/sup>, Mateo Sanchez Garcia de los Rios<sup><\/sup>, Brandon Bravo<sup><\/sup>, Jiwen Chen<sup><\/sup>, Paul Auger<sup><\/sup>, Jeffrey Mihalic<sup><\/sup>, Hao Lu<sup><\/sup>, Cristiana Guiducci<sup><\/sup>, Gwenn Hansen<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Nurix Therapeutics, Inc., San Francisco, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9498798f-8d4b-456f-96e0-99a6dba82169","ControlNumber":"4883","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

Resistance to PI bortezomib (BTZ) and carfilzomib (CFZ) is a major obstacle to the successful treatment of MM. The drug repurposing approach offers a promising strategy to classical drug development in particular in MM. Previously, ALK-inhibitors were shown to have anti-MM activity <i>ex vivo<\/i>. Therefore, we aimed to identify the mechanism of action of ALK-inhibitors against MM cells and to identify promising drug therapy combinations of ALK-inhibitors for refractory MM.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> A set of PI-na&#239;ve and PI-resistant cells was used in the study. Viability of the cells was determined by CCK8 viability assay. Genome-wide CRISPR\/Cas9-based loss-of-function screening with Brunello library was used in MM AMO-1 cell line to identify mechanism of action of ceritinib. Western blot was used to assess levels of total and phosphorylated proteins. RNA-seq was used to determine the amount of transcripts in PI-sensitive and PI-resistant cells.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Results:<\/b> Initially, 7 different ALK-inhibitors were tested across PI-na&#239;ve and PI-adapted MM cell lines. Based on the IC<sub>50 <\/sub>values, the most effective ALK-inhibitors to induce cytotoxicity in MM were ceritinib &#62; brigatinib &#62; crizotinib &#62; entrectinib. The combination of ceritinib, brigatinib and entrectinib showed synergistic cytotoxicity with the PI BTZ and CFZ and overcame PI-resistance in 4 different sets of PI-adapted cells. The strongest synergistic cytotoxicity was observed between ceritinib and CFZ in CFZ-adapted cells. CRISPR\/Cas9-screening identified genes involved in negative regulation of mTORC signalling (<i>NPRL2, NPRL3, TSC1, TSC2<\/i>) and transcription factor <i>FOXO1<\/i> as the major resistance candidates to ceritinib. Subsequently, ceritinib treatment significantly inhibited mTORC signaling, suggesting a shut-down of cellular proliferation due to targeting of the upstream receptor-tyrosine kinases (RTK), essential for cell viability and thus not identified by the screening. Further search identified InsR and IGF1R as the overlapping RTK inhibited by ceritinib and brigatinib. Co-treatment of PI-resistant cells with the combination of InsR\/IGF1R inhibitors and CFZ induced strong synergistic cytotoxicity, resembling the synergistic cytotoxicity observed for ceritinib and CFZ, whereas InsR\/IGF1R inhibitors did not show any synergistic cytotoxicity with ceritinib, suggesting targeting the same pathway. Our data further show that PI-na&#239;ve and resistant cells are negative for ALK, but positive for InsR and IGF1R expression.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Conclusion:<\/b> Crizotinib inhibits InsR\/IGF1R signaling in MM, which is essential for MM survival and together with CFZ it overcomes PI-resistance.

Our aim is to increase the number of patients reaching a pCR by overcoming cisplatin resistance. Previously we identified <i>NPEPPS<\/i> as a key player in cisplatin resistance that prevents cisplatin uptake via volume-regulated anion channels (VRAC) in cisplatin-resistant cell lines.

High recurrence rates, resistance to chemotherapy, and meager outcome highlight the need for improved therapies that stem from understanding the complex and multifactorial etiology of ovarian malignancies. Transforming growth factor-&#946; (TGF-&#946;) signaling can regulate both oncogenesis and metastasis in ovarian cancer (Kumri <i>et al. <\/i>2021). This, in part, is done by affecting apoptosis and survival mechanisms, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, immune cell recruitment and response. Inhibition of the TGF-&#946; signaling pathway is a potential pharmaceutical approach for treating ovarian malignancies.TP-6379 is a potent and orally available investigational TGF-&#946; receptor 1 (TGFBR1) inhibitor and is currently in preclinical development at Sumitomo Pharma Oncology, Inc. (SMP Oncology). We hypothesized that TP-6379 may inhibit the TGF-&#946; signaling pathway and show activity in preclinical ovarian cancer models. TP-6379 was observed to inhibit TGFBR1 potently in a biochemical kinase assay. Dose dependent increase in compound concentration was observed in ES-2 tumor burdened animals treated with TP-6379. Preclinical data showed TP-6379 (150 mg\/kg, BID) treatment significantly improved overall survival compared to vehicle treatment in an ES-2 mouse xenograft model of clear cell carcinoma. We hypothesize this result was, in part, due to alleviation of ovarian cancer induced cachexia, as animals treated with TP-6379 showed retention of muscle mass in their hind limbs compared to the vehicle treated animals. To investigate a combination effect with the standard of care in ovarian cancer, a SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer adenocarcinoma cell line was treated <i>in vitro<\/i> with TP-6379 and paclitaxel. Class III &#946;-tubulin (TUBB3), a potential resistance mechanism to paclitaxel, showed induced expression in response to TGF-&#946;, paclitaxel or both, after 24 hr treatment, and this effect was observed to be inhibited by TP-6379 treatment. In a SK-OV-3 xenograft model, TP-6379 (150 mg\/kg, BID) treatment showed the trend of tumor growth inhibition (TGI) as a monotherapy and showed enhanced TGI in combination with paclitaxel (7.5 mg\/kg, QW) when compared to vehicle treatment. Combination treatment in this xenograft model showed significant reduction of TUBB3 mRNA compared to paclitaxel treatment alone. In conclusion, our preliminary preclinical studies have shown promising activity for TP-6379 in ovarian malignancies as monotherapy and\/or in combination with standard of care. TP-6379 may be a viable therapeutic option by targeting the TGF-&#946; pathway in ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,TGF-&#946;,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tetyana  V.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States, with 40-50% of all patients developing metastasis at some point during their fight with the disease. With the approval of Regorafenib for treating metastatic colorectal cancer, steps have been taken to combat metastasis in colorectal cancer. A vital aspect of the development of metastasis is the development of resistance to first-line chemotherapy. Regorafenib is an oral small-molecule multiple kinase inhibitor. It is indicated worldwide for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), Regorafenib has already begun to show resistance in CRC. Understanding the mechanisms behind Regorafenib resistance in CRC is vital. Studies have demonstrated the expression of Long-non-coding RNA (LncRNA) to be linked to cancer metastasis and drug resistance. LncRNA UCA1 has been shown in other cancers to lead to resistance to different drugs like cisplatin, gemcitabine, 5-FU, tamoxifen, imatinib, and EGFR-TKIs. In our lab, we have found the LncRNA UCA1 to be overexpressed in CRC patient tissues, with increasing expression across stages I-III, compared to normal tissue. High UCA1 expression has decreased survival among colorectal cancer patients, per the TCGA patient cohort analysis. Furthermore, we found that high UCA1 expression in colorectal cancer cell lines leads to high IC50 values for Regorafenib. Lentiviral transduce stable overexpression (SW480), and knockdown (SW620) cell lines were developed for UCA1-regorafenib drug resistance mechanistic studies. Increased expression of UCA1 led to increased expression of crucial drug resistance genes (MDR1, ABCB1, and FOXM1) and increased IC50 compared to the control vector. In contrast, the knockdown of UCA1 led to decreased expression of resistance markers and IC50 in SW620 cells. A 3D spheroid model was utilized to assay regorafenib sensitivity to the UCA1 overexpressed and knockdown cell lines. High UCA1 expression leads to the formation of a higher number of 3D spheroid bodies and size when compared to vector. Furthermore, when treating the spheroid with IC50 concentration, UCA1 overexpressing spheroids showed higher vitality and increased size compared to the vector control. We have also analyzed the signaling pathways modulated by UCA1 in CRC cell lines, which may be involved in enhancing the regorafenib resistance. This supports the notion that UCA1 is critical in enhancing the resistance to regorafenib in CRC by activating drug resistance pathways. For the first time, this study demonstrates that UCA1 provides drug resistance to regorafenib in CRC, facilitating the progression of CRC metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"lncRNA,Resistance,Regorafenib,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kyle  D.

Chemotherapy, mainly based on cisplatin, is utilized in the treatment of advanced cases. However, a loss of chemotherapy effectiveness is frequent and can be related to both inherent or acquired resistance to the chemotherapy agent, resulting in high relapse rates. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in different stages of cancer, and it is correlated to resistance to therapy, but the process is still unclear. The purpose of this study is to explore EMT markers in a cisplatin resistant-based model. After determination of IC50, SCC9 cells were intermittently exposed to stepwise increasing concentrations of cisplatin, and Resistance Index (RI) was calculated. Population Doubling (PD) and Population Doubling Time (PDT) were calculated counting the number of viable cells using Trypan Blue method. Scratch assay was performed to investigate the impact on cellular migration. EMT-correlated markers were accessed by RT-qPCR and western blot. After 4 intermittent exposures to cisplatin, we obtained different clones with cisplatin resistance level, SCC9\/CPR5 (intermediate cisplatin resistance) and SCC9\/CPR11 (final cisplatin resistance) the SCC9\/CPR5 clone was obtained showing a mixed morphology between polygonal and fusiform. The complete fusiform morphology resembling mesenchymal cells was seen in SCC9\/CPR11, which demonstrated 2-fold of cisplatin resistance in comparison to parental cell line. SCC9\/CPR11 showed a difference of less than 1.16 PD and more than 15.5 hours PDT in relation to SCC9. Interestingly, the migratory profile was increased in SCC9\/CPR5. Snail1 and Vimentin mRNA levels and protein expression were increased at SCC9\/CPR11, but surprisingly E-cadherin was overexpressed but not in protein level. Others markers such as Zeb1, N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail2 and Twist showed an increase in mRNA levels only in SCC-9-CPR11, however only Twist exhibited high protein expression. Our study showed the establishment of cisplatin resistant SCC9 cells in different moments in relation to a resistance level based on the main two protein markers of EMT, Snail1 and Vimentin. Our data need to be further validated in larger well characterized techniques and we further envision investigating the epigenetic in DNA damage pathways correlating with cisplatin resistance and EMT status.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Cisplatin resistance,Oral cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dieila Giomo De Lima<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Gabriell Bonifácio Borgato<sup>2<\/sup>, Gustavo Narvaes Guimarães<sup>1<\/sup>, Débora Campanella Bastos<sup>1<\/sup>, Ricardo Della Coletta<sup>1<\/sup>, Ana Paula De Souza<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>State University of Campinas, Piracicaba, Brazil,<sup>2<\/sup>Centro Universitário Nossa Senhora do Patrocínio, Itu, Brazil","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3f387893-6255-4301-96f9-87b705545322","ControlNumber":"7787","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

While great strides have been made due to the introduction of immunotherapies and targeted therapies against oncogenic drivers, chemotherapies remain the standard of care for the majority of lung cancer patients. However, many patients do not respond to these treatments or relapse following an initial response. We postulate that part of the problem is the lack of consideration in preclinical research and clinical trials of the main driver of lung tumorigenesis, the aging process. Here, we show that the organismal reprogramming that occurs with aging makes lung tumors in an aged host more conducive to withstand chemotherapies. We traced this to an age-induced chronic accumulation of the stress hormone cortisol in circulation. Mechanistically our data show that chronic accumulation of cortisol drives the upregulation of metallothioneins&#8212;small, highly conserved, cysteine-rich metal-binding proteins&#8212;through activation of the glucocorticoid receptor in lung cancer cells, which in turn rewire these cells to be refractory to chemotherapies. Together, our work demonstrates a role for age-induced cortisol levels in promoting resistance to standard of care chemotherapies in lung cancer and offers a rationale for using therapeutic agents that block the glucocorticoid receptor to sensitize the average and most vulnerable lung cancer patients, the elderly, to chemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Cortisol,Aging,Glucocorticoid receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Devesh Raizada<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Stanislav Drapela<sup><\/sup>, Joanne Tejero<sup><\/sup>, Nadir Sarigul<sup><\/sup>, Didem Ilter<sup><\/sup>, Ana Gomes<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ace4908c-bde1-43e7-8abc-3c2fe3e6d174","ControlNumber":"2239","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

One strategy, termed an evolutionary double-bind, uses an initial therapy to elicit a specific adaptive mechanism that is then selectively targeted by a follow-on therapy. Here we examine combining radiation therapy followed by immunotherapy as a double bind strategy. Radiotherapy (RT) induces lethal double-strand DNA breaks in tumor cells and radiosensitivity is governed by the cells&#8217; DNA repair capabilities. Radioresistant cancer cells upregulate DNA damage response pathways. However, successful adaptations to RT and other DNA damaging agents can increase natural killer (NK) cell ligand expression on tumor cells increasing their vulnerability to the immune system.<br \/>We conducted a multidisciplinary investigation of this potential evolutionary double bind using an isogenic cell line model of radiation resistance derived from an androgen-independent human prostate carcinoma cell line (22Rv1). We demonstrate that RT-resistant cells maintain higher expression of NK cell ligands and have a 2-fold increase in sensitivity to NK cell mediated killing. Furthermore, we show that preferential targeting of the RT-resistant population by NK cells is preserved in competition assays with varying initial population frequencies. Scope of treatment responses are dependent on population frequencies in our <i>in vitro<\/i> analysis.<br \/>Mathematical modeling quantified three key elements of a double-bind: cost of resistance, inter-specific competition between RT-sensitive and RT-resistant lines, and preferential targeting of RT-resistant lines by NK cells. We conclude that RT followed by immunotherapy produces an evolutionary double bind that can be exploited in heterogenous tumors to limit RT resistance. Furthermore, model simulations predict that extinction of both populations is achievable by sequential RT and NK cell therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Evolution,Radiation,Double-bind,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kimberly Luddy<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jeffery West<sup>1<\/sup>, Mark Robertson-Tessi<sup>1<\/sup>, Bina Desai<sup>1<\/sup>, Taylor  M.

Unlike drug resistance, persistence mechanisms are not driven by genetic mutations, and are thus considered reversible after a &#8216;drug holiday&#8217; period. While most persistent cells remain in cell cycle arrest under drug treatment, recent work with EGFR-mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) cell lines has demonstrated that a small fraction of persister cells continue to undergo cell divisions under treatment with EGFR inhibitors. Thus, persister cells have a two-fold potential clinical significance: (i) they can serve as an intermediate state, allowing a non-resistant cancer cell to survive long enough and continue to divide under drug treatment to acquire a resistance mutation; and (ii) cycling persister cells might directly contribute to relapse, without a secondary resistance-driving mutation. Despite this, little is known about the underlying mechanisms by which affect the potential of a given cell to persist, or about the epigenetic traits that govern the distribution of persistence potential in a cell population. In this work, we use high-resolution lineage tracing to study lineages of drug persistent cells within a cancer cell population. Using the PC9 NSCLC cell line as a model, we demonstrate that while most lineages within the PC9 cell population can generate persisters, certain branches within the lineage tree have significantly higher persistence potentials than other branches, suggesting that inherited events determine the probability of a cell to persist under treatment. Moreover, we analyze the rate of change of the potential to persist within a single-cell-derived lineage of NSCLC cells and assess which branches within the lineage tree generate cycling persisters. Furthermore, we couple single-cell RNAseq data with lineage tracing information to identify gene expression patterns that correlate with the probability of drug-na&#239;ve cells to persist under drug treatment, allowing for insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the continuum of the probability to persist. Finally, we demonstrate that while persistent-derived PC9 cells are indeed resensitized after a drug holiday, they give rise to a significantly higher proportion of cycling persister cells upon resumption of drug treatment, allowing for a rapid repopulation of the cell culture by cycling persisters. These results suggest that lineage tracing is a powerful tool to study drug-induced persistence and resistance and we will apply it to multiple other cell lines and tumor types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,EGFR,Single cell,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Benny Zhitomirsky<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jideofor Ezike<sup>1<\/sup>, Elizabeth Hopkins<sup>1<\/sup>, Brian  P.
