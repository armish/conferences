The identification of the gene regulatory networks underpinning each state is essential for better understanding functional tumor heterogeneity and revealing tumor vulnerabilities. In cancer, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated with tumour stemness, metastasis and resistance to therapy. I will present evidence that EMT is not a binary process, but rather encompassed multiple tumour subpopulations associated with different EMT stages: from epithelial to completely mesenchymal states, passing through intermediate hybrid states. Although all EMT subpopulations presented similar tumour-propagating cell capacity, they displayed differences in cellular plasticity, invasiveness and metastatic potential. I will show how specific oncogenic mutations promote hybrid EMT states with increased stemness and metastatic potential. I will present new data uncovering the mechanisms by which EMT is associated with increased resistance to chemotherapy. Finally, I will discuss how new pharmacological intervention that target EMT and sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Drug resistance,Therapeutic target,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Cedric Blanpain<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
