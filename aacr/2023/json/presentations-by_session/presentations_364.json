[{"Abstract":"Background: IMMUcan (SPECTA NCT02834884) is a European public-private effort to generate molecular and cellular profiling data of the human tumor microenvironment (TME) from up to 3,000 patients, to better understand how the immune system and tumors interact. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogenous disease with distinct molecular subtypes characterized by different gene expression, genomic profiles, and clinical outcomes. Here, we explored the association between molecular subtypes and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy as well as levels of immune cell infiltration in the prospective IMMUcan TNBC cohort.<br \/>Methods: At the cut-off date on June 29<sup>th<\/sup>, 2022, we identified a first cohort of 132 patients to perform preliminary analyses, of which 109 had pre-treatment RNAseq data available. Among those, pathological Complete Response (pCR) information was available for a total of 86 patients. Preliminary data included the density of CD3+, CD20+ and CD8+ immune cells from the stroma and tumor compartments from multiplex-immunofluorescence (mIF) for 69 patients. TNBC subtypes were computed as described by Bareche et al. Association of continuous variables with pCR was evaluated with logistic regression (univariate analysis).<br \/>Results: The pCR rates differed across TNBC subtypes (Fisher&#8217;s test, P = 0.02). In detail, pCR was achieved in 88% (8\/9) of basal like (BL), 63% (17\/27) of immunomodulatory (IM) and 45% (16\/35) of mesenchymal (M) tumors, while lower pCR rates were observed for the mesenchymal stem-like (MSL) and luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtypes with 37% (3\/8) and 14% (1\/7), respectively, suggesting differences in the sensitivity to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in line with previous reports. When considered as continuous signature scores, pCR was positively associated to BL levels (OR = 2.7, 95% CI, 1.5-4.8; False Discovery Rate [FDR] = 0.0031), and negatively associated to MSL and LAR signature levels (OR = 0.53, 95% CI, 0.32-0.87; FDR = 0.019; OR = 0.30, 95% CI, 0.12-0.74; FDR= 0.019). In addition, CD3+ cell densities in the tumor and stroma were significantly higher in IM tumors (P = 0.002 and P &#60; 0.001), while lower levels were found in M tumors (P = 0.005, P = 0.002). Similarly, stromal CD20+ levels were higher in IM tumors (P = 0.008) and lower in M tumors (P = 0.006), suggesting a more immunosuppressive TME in the M subtype. CD8+ cells levels were not significantly different between subtypes.<br \/>Conclusions: These preliminary results show relevant differences in the pCR rates among TNBC subtypes, to be confirmed on a larger series of patients and further suggesting a substantial TNBC heterogeneity regarding treatment response. Of note, preliminary mIF results suggest a differential role of the immune response across molecular subtypes. Additional analyses integrating mIF and genomic data are currently ongoing.<br \/>Funding: IMI2 JU grant agreement 821558, supported by EU&#8217;s Horizon 2020 and EFPIA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-07 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Tumor microenvironment,Molecular subtypes,Image analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Andrea Joaquin Garcia<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mattia Rediti<sup>1<\/sup>, Abdelkader Benyagoub<sup>2<\/sup>, Stéphanie Tissot<sup>3<\/sup>, Sylvie Rusakiewicz<sup>3<\/sup>, Robin Liechti<sup>4<\/sup>, Flavia Marzetta<sup>4<\/sup>, Nicolas Penel<sup>5<\/sup>, Julio Oliveira<sup>6<\/sup>, Jean-Charles Goeminne<sup>7<\/sup>, Pierre Fournel<sup>8<\/sup>, Andreia Capela<sup>9<\/sup>, Xiaoxiao Wang<sup>10<\/sup>, Delphine Vincent<sup>10<\/sup>, Françoise Rothe<sup>1<\/sup>, Marie Morfouace<sup>11<\/sup>, Henoch Hong<sup>11<\/sup>, Donald Jackson<sup>12<\/sup>, Christos Sotiriou<sup>10<\/sup>, Laurence Buisseret<sup>10<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Institut Jules Bordet, Brussels, Belgium,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Oncology, Center of Experimental Therapeutics, CHUV, Laussane, Switzerland,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Oncology, Center of Experimental Therapeutics, CHUV, Lausanne, Switzerland,<sup>4<\/sup>Vital-IT Group, SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland,<sup>5<\/sup>Oscar Lambret Cancer Center, Lille, France,<sup>6<\/sup>Instituto Português de Oncologia, Porto, Portugal,<sup>7<\/sup>Service of Medical Oncology, Clinique et Maternité Ste Elizabeth, Namur, Belgium,<sup>8<\/sup>Institut de Cancérologie Lucien Neuwirth, Saint-Étienne, France,<sup>9<\/sup>Centro Hospitalar Vila Nova Gaia e Espinho, Vila Nova De Gaia, Portugal,<sup>10<\/sup>Breast Cancer Translational Research Laboratory, Institut Jules Bordet, Brussels, Belgium,<sup>11<\/sup>Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany,<sup>12<\/sup>Acting Head Sanofi, Cambridge, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b5b7f585-c0be-47ed-9d63-12cea66245fe","ControlNumber":"3486","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Tissue resection or biopsy are unusual, so the scarce sample available has limited our knowledge on the biology of SCLC tumors. Recent advances propose novel molecular subtypes (SCLC-A, SCLC-N, SCLC-P, SCLC-I, NAPI classification) to classify SCLC patients and specific treatment susceptibilities of defined subgroups. In this line, we collected 119 tumor samples from a cohort of early-stage SCLC patients with complete clinical annotation, in order to find specific molecular and immune profiles that define new patient characteristics with potential impact on prognosis or therapy selection. For this, we subjected the tumor tissue to RNA-seq targeted panel of onco-immune-related genes and to immune characterization by IHC. In addition, we analyzed molecular aberrations by whole exome sequencing. All data, including clinical annotations, were integrated by multiparametric computational analysis. Based on the computational analysis of the onco-immune transcriptomic data, we found two major groups of patients with either pro-immunogenic or pro-tumorigenic profiles. The transcriptomic pro-immunogenic group shows better survival and higher infiltration of immune cells (CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells and Macrophages). In contrast, the pro-tumorigenic group presents worse survival and less immune cell infiltration. Using bioinformatics, we described a gene signature that can identify both subgroups. This gene signature includes immune cell markers (MS4A1, CD3D), antigen receptor complex (CD79A), adhesion and migration of T cells (CD2) and immunomodulatory genes (IDO1, TIGIT) expressed in the pro-immunogenic group, and, proliferation (MKI67), transcription regulator (TOP2A) and epithelial and mesenchymal transition-related genes (TWIST1) in the pro-tumorigenic group. Exome sequencing analysis resulted in the expected genomic heterogeneity of SCLC tumors beyond TP53 and RB1 mutations in most patients. However, we found a significant enrichment of XIRP2 gene alterations in the pro-tumorigenic group. Consistent with an early-stage of SCLC, most of the samples were described as SCLC-A subtype by the predominant expression of ASCL1. Interestingly, our findings suggest a relevant biological heterogeneity within SCLC-A tumors that impacts immune infiltrate and disease outcome. Here we show a gene signature that can subclassify early-stage SCLC patients according to their clinical, molecular and immune features, and provides prognostic value independently of the NAPI classification. Since immunogenicity of the tumor impacts response to immunotherapy, we speculate that this gene signature might predict therapy response and therefore contribute to tailored treatment of SCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-07 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Expression analysis,Exome sequencing,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Angel Nunez-Buiza<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, David Gómez-Sánchez<sup>2<\/sup>, Jose Maria Gracia-Rodríguez<sup>1<\/sup>, Esther Conde<sup>3<\/sup>, Jose Luis Solorzano<sup>4<\/sup>, Eva María Garrido-Martín<sup>5<\/sup>, Jose Carlos Machado<sup>6<\/sup>, Susana Guimarães<sup>7<\/sup>, Ernest Nadal<sup>8<\/sup>, Sonia Molina-Pinelo<sup>9<\/sup>, Miguel Ángel Piris Pinilla<sup>10<\/sup>, Nuria Romero-Laorden<sup>11<\/sup>, Fernando Franco<sup>12<\/sup>, Fernando López-Ríos Moreno<sup>3<\/sup>, Álvaro Conrado Ucero<sup>13<\/sup>, Luis Paz-Ares<sup>14<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Research Institute (i+12) Hospital 12 de Octubre \/ Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO), Madrid, Spain,<sup>2<\/sup>Research Institute (i+12) Hospital 12 de Octubre \/ Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO) \/ Biomedical Research Cancer Network Center (CIBERONC), Madrid, Spain,<sup>3<\/sup>Pathology Department, Research Institute (i+12) Hospital 12 de Octubre \/ Biomedical Research Cancer Network Center (CIBERONC), Madrid, Spain,<sup>4<\/sup>Pathology Department, Research Institute (i+12) Hospital 12 de Octubre \/ Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO) \/ MD Anderson, Madrid, Spain,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Cell Biology, R&D Division, & Oncology Business Unit, Biomedical Research Cancer Network Center (CIBERONC) \/ PharmaMar, Madrid, Spain,<sup>6<\/sup>Faculty of Medicine of the University of Porto \/ i3S – Institute for Research and Innovation in Health of the University of Porto \/ IPATIMUP - Institute of Molecular Pathology and Immunology of the University of Porto, Porto, Portugal,<sup>7<\/sup>Pathology Department, Centro Hospitalar Universitário S.João \/ Faculty of Medicine of the University of Porto, Porto, Portugal,<sup>8<\/sup>Catalan Institute of Oncology, IDIBELL, Barcelona, Spain,<sup>9<\/sup>Biomedical Research Cancer Network Center (CIBERONC) \/ Institute of Biomedicine of Seville (IBIS) (HUVR, CSIC, Universidad de Sevilla), Sevilla, Spain,<sup>10<\/sup>Pathology Service, Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Madrid, Spain,<sup>11<\/sup>Division of Medical Oncology, Hospital Universitario La Princesa, Madrid, Spain,<sup>12<\/sup>Pathology Department, MD Anderson, Madrid, Spain,<sup>13<\/sup>Departments of Medicine and Physiology, Research Institute (i+12) Hospital 12 de Octubre \/ Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO) \/ School of Medicine, Complutense University, Madrid, Spain,<sup>14<\/sup>Departments of Medicine and Physiology, Research Institute (i+12) Hospital 12 de Octubre \/ Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO) \/ Biomedical Research Cancer Network Center (CIBERONC) \/ School of Medicine, Complutense University \/ Medical Oncology, Madrid, Spain","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5b7e2be6-d895-40fe-bfba-1b375ec089c5","ControlNumber":"2379","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Clinically, pulmonary LCNECs (pLCNECs) mirror the course common to SCLC - initial response followed by rapid and insurmountable resistance to one-size-fits-all approaches. Recently, SCLC has been subdivided into four subtypes with unique vulnerabilities, three of which are defined by the transcription factors ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3, while a fourth group exhibits an inflamed signature. We hypothesize that pLCNEC may be similarly classified into molecularly distinct subsets with unique therapeutic vulnerabilities - a fundamental step toward personalized medicine. We applied our SCLC 1300 gene signature to pLCNEC patient tumors and, as in SCLC, found three distinct subtypes determined by differential expression of <i>ASCL1<\/i>, <i>NEUROD1<\/i>, and <i>POU2F3<\/i>, but with a unique fourth subtype marked by expression of the transcription factor <i>YAP1<\/i>. Unlike in treatment-na&#239;ve SCLC, where YAP1 is absent, <i>YAP1 <\/i>expression clearly defines pLCNEC as two, roughly equal subsets with the <i>YAP1<\/i>-low tumors encompassing tumors expressing the other three transcription factors. Conversely, <i>YAP1<\/i>-high pLCNEC is more mesenchymal and inflamed, and less neuroendocrine (NE), reminiscent of inflamed SCLC. Additionally, YAP1-high status is associated with smoking exposure (P&#60;0.001, FC=81), high frequency of <i>CDKN2A<\/i> homozygous deletion and <i>SMARCA4<\/i> mutations, as well as intact <i>RB1<\/i>. These features are distinct from SCLC, wherein transcriptional subtypes lack distinct genomic characteristics. Consistent with <i>CDKN2A<\/i> deletion, <i>YAP1<\/i>-high pLCNEC cell lines have increased sensitivity to MEK1 and CDK4\/6 inhibition. We also demonstrate that RB1 loss downregulates YAP1 expression, which may account for the absence of YAP1 in treatment-na&#239;ve SCLC due to ubiquitous loss of <i>RB1<\/i>. In contrast to treatment-na&#239;ve SCLC, where our group and others have been unable to detect YAP1, single-cell RNAseq analysis of biopsies from patients with relapsed SCLC identified emerging <i>YAP1<\/i>-positive cancer cell populations, which are similarly associated with increased EMT, immune cell infiltration (CD8+ T-cells), and loss of NE gene expression. This suggests that the ability for cancer cells to acquire YAP1 expression and, perhaps, pLCNEC-like features, may be a resistance mechanism in relapsed SCLC, contributing to the abundant intratumoral heterogeneity and highlighting potential vulnerabilities to overcome resistance. In summary, YAP1 may be a predictive biomarker of intact <i>RB1<\/i> and response to cellular and checkpoint immunotherapy and MEK1\/CDK4\/6 inhibition in pLCNEC and relapsed SCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-07 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"YAP1,Resistance,Lung cancer,Heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>C.

We present preliminary results from the retrospective cohort.<br \/><b>Experimental procedures<\/b>: A retrospective analysis conducted in patients with metastatic or recurrent NSCLC included in the MATCH-R study (NCT02517892) at Gustave Roussy (Villejuif, France). CH was evaluated by a 74-gene targeted NGS panel (HaloPlex - Agilent) performed on DNA extracted by isolated-by-blood leukocytes. The variant allele frequency (VAF) threshold of detection was set at 1%.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: 108 consecutive patients with advanced NSCLC included from October 2015 to July 2019 were evaluated, irrespective of the tumor molecular profile. 46% of the patients were female, 67% were former or current smokers. 82% of the patients had adenocarcinoma and 44%, 23%, 33% had bone, liver and\/or brain metastases, respectively. Patients had received a median of 2 lines of systemic therapy and 81% were on active anticancer treatment at the time of CH assessment. At least one CH mutation was found in 38 out of 108 patients (35% prevalence), with an increasing with age trend. Patients carrying CH were older as compared to those without CH and had in 29% vs. 11% of cases tumor histology other than adenocarcinoma (p=0.009). No difference in overall survival was observed according to CH detection (log rank p=0.318). We found 64 mutations in 19 different genes: 63% of the patients carried a single mutation, while co-occurrence of two, three, four or five mutations, within the same gene or in more than one, was found in seven (18%), four (11%), one (3%) and two patients (5%), respectively. Epigenetic modifiers (<i>DNMT3A<\/i>, <i>TET2<\/i>, <i>ASXL1<\/i>) were the most frequently mutated genes: 38 mutations with a median VAF of 6.5% detected in 32 patients. DNA repair genes (<i>PPM1D<\/i>, <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>CHEK2<\/i>, <i>ATM<\/i>) were the second most frequently mutated: 11 mutations at a median VAF of 4% were detected in 9 patients. 7 mutations in genes encoding for the cohesin complex (<i>SMC3<\/i>, <i>SMC1A<\/i>, <i>RAD21<\/i>, <i>STAG2<\/i>) were found in 6 patients, with a median VAF of 5%. A non-simultaneous cfDNA sequencing by FoundationOne Liquid CDx assay (324-gene panel) was performed in 9 patients for tumor profiling. In 2 out of 3 tested cases the presence of CH was confirmed in plasma liquid biopsy. 4 patients with no detectable CH by the targeted blood sequencing subsequently were found having CH mutations in plasma NGS, on average 45 months apart. To note, as many as 5 out of the 19 detected mutated genes (<i>PPM1D, SMC3, SMC1A, PRPF8, ZRSR2<\/i>) are not part of the FDA-approved NGS panel used for cfDNA profiling in solid tumors.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: We found a consistent prevalence of CH in patients with NSCLC by using a sequencing approach targeted for hematologic disorders. Prognostic implications of CH are under investigation and will be evaluated in the full cohort.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-10 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Clonal evolution,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Circulating cell-free DNA,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Marco Tagliamento<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Christophe Marzac<sup><\/sup>, Mihaela Aldea<sup><\/sup>, Damien Vasseur<sup><\/sup>, Arnaud Bayle<sup><\/sup>, Anas Gazzah<sup><\/sup>, Maud Ngocamus<sup><\/sup>, Claudio Nicotra<sup><\/sup>, Julieta Rodriguez<sup><\/sup>, Antonin Levy<sup><\/sup>, Capucine Baldini<sup><\/sup>, Santiago Ponce<sup><\/sup>, Felix Blanc-Durand<sup><\/sup>, Etienne Rouleau<sup><\/sup>, Antoine Italiano<sup><\/sup>, Ludovic Lacroix<sup><\/sup>, Luc Friboulet<sup><\/sup>, David Planchard<sup><\/sup>, Fabrice Barlesi<sup><\/sup>, Yohann Loriot<sup><\/sup>, Jean-Baptiste Micol<sup><\/sup>, Benjamin Besse<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1d93a2d7-77bb-4610-8af9-3acaf54a32bc","ControlNumber":"6087","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

We hypothesized that reversal of resistance to PD-1 blockade with CTLA-4 blockade would result in increased CD8 T-cell infiltration in patient biopsies.<br \/>Methods: Multiplex ion beam imaging (MIBI) for 32 protein markers, spanning tumor, immune, and stromal cell types, was used to evaluate the tumor microenvironment in melanoma tumor biopsies collected at baseline (N=21 samples) and one month on-treatment (N=22; N=16 paired timepoints). Tumor-immune cell dynamics were determined by comparing baseline and on-treatment biopsies within clinical groups (ipi\/nivo response, N=10; ipi\/nivo no-response, N=9; ipi no-response, N=8).<br \/>Results: Multiplex analysis in ipi\/nivo responsive patients demonstrated increased proportions of CD8 (median 1.6X increase), CD4 (2.1X), regulatory T cells (1.6X), and monocytes (1.4X), with a paralleled 8.1X decrease in melanoma cells over the course of treatment. This was confirmed by histopathologic evidence of tumor regression, necrosis, and immune infiltrate in on-treatment, responding tumor biopsies, as determined by dermatopathologists. Melanoma cells had direct, cell-membrane interactions with CD8 T cells in ipi\/nivo responsive patients, both at baseline (median 26%) and on-treatment (median 86%). The shared interface between melanoma and CD8 T-cells had polarized expression of CD3, CD8, and CD45RO. There was no change in T-cell infiltration nor tumor cell content over the course of treatment in ipi\/nivo non-responders nor ipi non-responders; similar proportions of melanoma cells were interacting with CD8 T-cells at baseline (median 24%) and on-treatment (27%).<br \/>Conclusion: Reversal of resistance to PD-1 blockade is associated with increased frequency of CD8 T-melanoma cell interactions and pathological response, reflective of different stages of antitumor immune responses. Response to ipi\/nivo in the anti-PD-1 refractory setting was further associated with increased tumor-polarized and activated CD8 T cells interacting with melanoma cells, demonstrated by the colocalized expression of immune synapse proteins at tumor-CD8-T-cell membrane interfaces.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-10 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Checkpoint Inhibitors,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Image analysis,Response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Katie M.

However, comprehensive analysis of the changing tumor molecular landscape to support evaluation of such a hypothesis is often difficult to quantify due to the lack of accessibility to longitudinal biopsy samples in a large number of patients (pts). Longitudinal analyses using pWGS or pWES may allow the delineation of the genetic evolution of tumors and its impact on treatment outcomes. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of obtaining pWGS and pWES data from ctDNA in pretreatment samples from pts enrolled in 2 phase 3 trials that evaluated second-line pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy\/standard-of-care therapy: KEYNOTE-040 (recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; NCT02252042) and KEYNOTE-045 (metastatic urothelial carcinoma, NCT02256436). Concordance between pWES and tWES was also evaluated.<br \/>Methods: Cell-free DNA was isolated from 1-3 mL of plasma; pWGS (via low-pass WGS) and pWES were performed on samples from pts with available tWES data generated as part of planned tissue biomarker analyses for the respective studies. Tumor burden in ctDNA was estimated from pWES data using single nucleotide variant (SNV)-based maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) and from pWGS data using a copy number variation-based measure of mutational burden in the tumor fraction. Concordance between the pWES and tWES mutational spectrum was determined using the Jaccard index. Concordance of key driver somatic events (<i>FGFR3, TP53<\/i>, and HPV status) was evaluated.<br \/>Results: Plasma samples from 47 pts (KEYNOTE-040, n = 24; KEYNOTE-045, n = 23) were analyzed. Tumor burden estimates from pWGS (median coverage, 5.84; range, 4.28-8.18) and pWES (median coverage, 1806; range, 1038-2413) data were highly correlated (Spearman &#961; = 0.94). A range of 0 to 956 nonsynonymous SNVs (median, 50) per pt was identified in ctDNA. When the ctDNA tumor burden was high (MSAF &#8805;5%, observed in two-thirds of pts), a relatively high concordance was observed for individual alterations in <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>FGFR3<\/i>, and HPV status (overall agreement: 0.87, 0.97, and 0.96, respectively); between tissue- and plasma-based tumor mutational burden (R = 0.49); and in overall mutational landscape overlap (Jaccard index: median, 0.30; range, 0.002-0.53).<br \/>Conclusions: These data show that pWES exhibits reasonably high concordance with tWES when the tumor burden in ctDNA is relatively high and may be informative regarding tumor genomic characteristics. Extensive longitudinal studies are still needed to understand tumor genetic evolution using plasma ctDNA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-07 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Plasma,Whole exome sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Razvan Cristescu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Andrew Albright<sup><\/sup>, Steven Townson<sup><\/sup>, Cai Chen<sup><\/sup>, Blanca Homet Moreno<sup><\/sup>, Nati Lerman<sup><\/sup>, Z.

Epstein-Barr virus infection is associated with most NPCs in both areas. We dissected the gene expression (GE) and microenvironment of NPC, leading to the identification of molecular subtypes that might explain the differences between EA and NEA NPCs. We retrieved data from NPC-EA transcriptomic repositories: 6 GE datasets, including tumor and normal samples (GSE12452, GSE34573, GSE132112, GSE53819, GSE68799, GSE102349); one validation dataset with both EA and NEA(https:\/\/doi.org\/10.5281\/zenodo.5347891); 4 GE signatures associated with prognosis and treatment prediction (PMID: 24297049, 35262435, 32596151, 33096113); and NPC EBV related genes\/pathways and gene sets (PMID: 35846746, 35394843, 35105963; Liu NPC, Wood EBV EBNA1 Down, Sengupta NPC LMP1 UP, REACTOME DNA Repair; Hallmarks). The 6 datasets were integrated using a bioinformatic meta-analysis approach, and the classifier method was applied to the validation dataset in order to identify the subtype with worst prognosis. Furthermore, RNA sequencing was performed on 50 Italian NEA NPC samples (INT188\/19; GSE208281). Biological and functional profiling of EA and NEA were performed using xCell, Gene set enrichment analyses, and treatment prediction methods (PMID: 16103067, pRRophetic R, PMID: 28052254). Four clusters (Cl) were identified through a meta-analysis of EA-NPC. Prognostic analyses revealed that Cl3 had the worst prognosis (P=0.0476), confirmed by three of the four prognostic signatures and in the validation dataset (P=0.0368). Based on the biological and functional characterization of these clusters, we arrived at the following GE subtypes: Cl1, Immune-active; Cl2, Defense-response; Cl3, Proliferation; Cl4, Perineural-interaction\/EBV-exhaustion. According to the treatment prediction methods, the sensitivity of each cluster was radiotherapy and immunotherapy for immune-active, radiochemotherapy and immunotherapy for defense-response, chemotherapy for proliferation, and cisplatin treatment for perineural-interaction\/EBV-exhaustion. In our NEA cohort, only three clusters were expressed (excluding perineural-interaction\/EBV-exhaustion). Immune\/biological characterization and treatment prediction analyses of NEA partially replicated the EA results. Our study provides a relevant biological overview of EBV-related NPC in both EA and NEA. The immune microenvironment plays a critical role in NPC owing to the viral etiology of this malignancy. The presence of a perineural-interaction\/EBV-exhaustion cluster in EA suggests an inactive EBV infection according to the viral related &#8220;hit and run theory&#8221;; however, further analyses are needed. The immune\/biological characterization of EA and NEA may help predict the response to different therapeutic strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-07 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma,Gene expression profiling,Microenvironment,Prognosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Deborah Lenoci<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Carlo Resteghini<sup>1<\/sup>, Mara Serena Serafini<sup>1<\/sup>, Federico Pistore<sup>1<\/sup>, Silvana Canevari<sup>1<\/sup>, Brigette B.Y.

While it is mainly affecting patients with a smoking and\/or alcohol history (SD), 10% to 15% of OSCC are diagnosed in patients with not known risk factors (NSND). We and others have shown that OSCC from NSND patients are characterized by an enrichment in interferon gamma (IFN&#947;) response and PD-1 signaling pathways together with a higher intratumor T-cell infiltrate. Herein, we seek to gain more insights into the immune and non-immune tumor microenvironment (TME) of OSCC in SD vs. NSND patients.<br \/>Material and Methods: We made use of single-cell RNA seq (10x Genomics) from non-sorted and CD45 negative enriched cell suspensions of OSCC biopsies from 11 treatment na&#239;ve patients, human papillomavirus negative, including 6 SD and 5 NSND patients.<br \/>Results: All samples were characterized by a strong immune cell infiltrate. Consistent with our previous results, the analysis of 51,629 immune cells confirmed that NSND patients&#8217; samples displayed a significantly higher proportion of T cells (p = 0.005) compared to SD patients. NK cells were also increased, with 2% in SD patients versus 6% in NSND patients (p = 0.008). T cells strongly expressed IFN&#947; and remarkably, both myeloid cells and tumor cells from NSND patients had an increased enrichment in IFN&#947; response pathway in NSND as compared to SD patients. The TME of SD patients was characterized by the presence of 15% of plasma cells vs. 3% in NSND patients (p = 0.003). Thus, tumors from NSND versus SD patients represent two distinct groups of tumors characterized by a different immune TME. Moreover, tumors from SD patients displayed 2% vs. 4% Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) (p = 0.01). In addition, among CAFs subpopulations, myofibroblast CAFs, defined as the subpopulation producing extracellular matrix proteins were found only in tumors from SD patients, suggesting that distinct CAFs subpopulations may shape the immune TME by affecting the recruitment and function of adaptive immune cells in SD versus NSND patients. Finally, we analyzed tumor cells using non-negative matrix factorization to find Meta Programs (MP), which are set of genes coordinately upregulated. We identified 5 MP associated with different biological functions: epithelial differentiation, stress, cell cycle (G2\/M), partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and epithelial senescence. While the epithelial differentiation MP was found in all patients, the remaining ones were more frequently found in SD patients.<br \/>Conclusion: Our results show that the TME of OSCC from NSND vs. SD differs in terms of T, NK, and plasma cells composition, CAFs, and tumor cells MP. Integration with spatial transcriptomics is ongoing. Those biological differences may represent an opportunity to refine the therapeutic approaches in the two populations of patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-07 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oral cancers,Smoking,Single cell,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yannick Le Meitour<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Béatrice Vanbervliet<sup>1<\/sup>, Sonia Canjura-Rodriguez<sup>1<\/sup>, Cyril Degletagne<sup>1<\/sup>, Laurie Tonon<sup>1<\/sup>, Lucas Michon<sup>1<\/sup>, Jebrane Bouaoud<sup>1<\/sup>, Philippe Zrounba<sup>2<\/sup>, Aude Excoffier<sup>2<\/sup>, Karène Mahtouk<sup>1<\/sup>, Pierre Saintigny<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Univ Lyon, Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University, INSERM 1052, CNRS 5286, Centre Léon Bérard, Cancer Research Center of Lyon, Lyon, France,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Surgical Oncology, Centre Léon Bérard, Lyon, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7abc6db0-c482-4611-9ed8-764c620ddab3","ControlNumber":"3488","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

We developed ex vivo ADCC and CDC assays to study the mechanism of actions of ZL-1211. Our preclinical data has demonstrated greater antitumor activities than the clinical leading benchmark via enhanced ADCC by mutation in Fc&#947; domain and potent CDC activities. We used those ex vivo assays to further profile the clinical specimens from patients collected at baseline (pre-infusion) and the following cycles (post-infusion) in our phase 1 study (NCT05065710). Preliminary results in clinical samples indicated that baseline ADCC and CDC capabilities were correlated with anti-tumor activity of ZL-1211 in patients with CLDN18.2-positive locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, suggesting probable predictive biomarkers. Results also showed that changes in circulating ZL-1211 mediated ADCC and CDC activities were dose-dependent and in accordance with the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. In addition, we performed differential gene expression analysis and real-time PCR to compare gene expression in ZL-1211 responder and non-responder PDX models and CCLE cell lines. Our findings reveal that several immune-related genes may serve to predict the responses to ZL-1211 treatment. Other potential predictive biomarkers such as Fc&#947; receptor CD16A polymorphism and baseline stromal CD8 expression were also evaluated in clinical samples. Taken together, analytical approaches developed and validated from preclinical studies were successfully translated to characterize clinical samples in the current Phase 1 trial. The exploratory analysis indicated the clinical relevance of multiple biomarkers and their potential as predictive biomarkers of ZL-1211.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-06 Laboratory correlates for targeted agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,CLDN18.2,Translation,Phase I,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zhen Luo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Xiao Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Xuehuo Zeng<sup>1<\/sup>, Jiaqing Yi<sup>1<\/sup>, Tegan Burns<sup>1<\/sup>, Herman Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Xinyu Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Wenyu Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Karl Hsu<sup>1<\/sup>, Hua Gong<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Zai Lab (US) LLC, Menlo Park, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Zai Lab (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"263158b0-836a-4a55-89fb-94101916d657","ControlNumber":"5248","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Z.

Focusing on patients with metastatic melanoma refractory to anti-PD-1 therapy who received ipilimumab &#177; nivolumab (ipi&#177;nivo), we hypothesize that combination therapy could overcome anti-PD-1 primary resistance in some patients, by facilitating T-cell trafficking and infiltration into the tumor.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Visium spatial transcriptomics using 18,000 RNA plex (n=10), multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) using 32 protein plex (n=4), and CosMx single cell imaging using 1000 RNA plex (n=2) were performed on paired baseline (n=5) and on-therapy biopsy samples (n=5).

However, further analysis of the paired biopsies in the ipi monotherapy non-responder revealed a concomitant increase in the immune-suppressive M2 macrophages, tolerogenic DCs, regulatory T cells, and exhausted T cells, which was not observed in the ipi+nivo responders. Confirmatory studies performed in two patients (ipi+nivo responder vs ipi non-responder) using MIBI confirmed a decrease in the tumor burden, and large increases in CD8 (199X in ipi+nivo vs 1.52X in ipi), CD4 (22.3X in ipi+nivo vs 8.56X in ipi), and T cells (26.1X in ipi+nivo vs 2.13X in ipi). Focusing on the non-responder (ipi) paired biopsies, CosMx revealed heterogeneous tumor clusters, with little to no immune infiltration in the baseline biopsy, and a decrease in tumor burden with increased markers of immune response and immune suppression in the on-therapy biopsy.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Integrated single cell spatial analyses, on the RNA and protein levels, revealed increased immune cell recruitment to the tumor site in responders to anti-CTLA-4 + anti-PD-1 therapy compared to a non-responder to anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy, and may provide clues to cancer-immune cell interactions in response to ICB. The presence of immune suppressive clusters at the tumor site in the on-therapy biopsy in the anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy would support our hypothesis that while anti-CTLA-4 facilitates T-cell trafficking and infiltration into the tumor site, anti-CTLA-4 alone without anti-PD-1 may not be sufficient to overcome anti-PD-1 primary resistance in some patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-10 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Single cell,Imaging,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nataly Naser Al Deen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Katie M.

Transducin Beta-Like Protein 1 (TBL1) is a necessary co-activator for beta-catenin&#8217;s oncogenic activity. Wnt-activation promotes formation of a TBL1: beta-catenin complex that protects &#946;-catenin from degradation in the nucleus and promotes Wnt-target gene activation. Tegavivint binds TBL1 preventing the interaction with beta-catenin, which results in nuclear beta-catenin degradation and inhibition of downstream transcription. For patients whose desmoid tumors responded to tegavivint we assayed changes in serum-based proteins, selected based on their cancer-related function and dysregulation by aberrant Wnt\/ beta-catenin signaling, to potentially identify suitable biomarkers that may be useful in future studies.<br \/>Methods: Whole blood and tumor tissue was collected from desmoid patients before and after administration of tegavivint at dose levels ranging from 1 to 5 mg\/kg administered via a 4-hour intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Collection timepoints were pre-dose and up 1 week (wk.) following the start of the infusion. Secreted protein levels were profiled in the serum using Luminex multiplex technology. Changes in protein levels were compared to the tegavivint pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles. Tissue samples were analyzed for gene expression changes.<br \/>Results: Preliminary analyses demonstrated that the majority of tegavivint treated patients with an objective response to tegavivint showed a consistent and expected pattern in serum levels of known Wnt\/ beta-catenin regulated proteins. Decreases in levels of DKK1, FGF-2, MMP-1, PDGF-AA and VEGF-A and an increase in CCL5 levels were observed. In treated patient serum, protein level changes were detected as early as 2 hours (h) following the start of infusion and continued to progress in the predicted direction at 24 h. At the 5 mg\/kg dose, all selected biomarkers remained decreased (or in the case of CCL5, increased) during the dosing interval, with a tegavivint half-life of 48.6 h and C<sub>min<\/sub> (trough value) 1 wk. post treatment above in vitro IC<sub>50<\/sub> values. Gene expression changes were found in tumor tissue in comparing pre- to post-tegavivint treatment.<br \/>Conclusion: A panel of beta-catenin regulated proteins and transcripts were identified as candidate pharmacodynamic biomarkers in patients whose desmoid tumor responded to tegavivint. Alterations in these serum proteins continued throughout the dosing interval and, for several proteins, a potential dose response correlation was observed. Further characterization of the relationship between tegavivint plasma levels, serum biomarkers, transcriptional changes and clinical responses in additional patients and time points will be presented.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-07 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Wnt signaling,TBL1,Tegavivint,Desmoid Tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Stephen Horrigan<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kimberly  R.

A national multidisciplinary tumor board (NatCUPMTB) was created 2 years ago in France to discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic management of CUP pts. The objective of this study was to evaluate its diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic impact after 2 years of activity. Methods: This was a multicenter retrospective study with prospective follow-up. All pts discussed at least once in the NatCUPMTB between June 2020 and August 2022 were included. Pts and tumors characteristics, pathological and molecular analyses including WGS, WES and RNAseq performed on SEQOIA and AURAGEN national large-scale sequencing platforms, multidisciplinary tumor board (MTB) conclusions, and follow-up after MTB were collected. Results: 76 pts for whom a long-term follow-up was available were included. The median age at diagnosis was 57 yo, 54% were female, and the median number of metastatic sites at diagnosis was 2. The median time between diagnosis and first MTB presentation was 3.8 months (0.2-55). MTB investigations enabled to identify a likely primary origin in 44\/76 (58%) pts, and the MTB recommended a personalized therapeutic strategy in 50\/76 patients (66%). MTB recommendations were based on the combination of clinical, pathological and molecular investigations in 55% of pts. After a median follow-up of 6.2 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 17.7 months from diagnosis and 11.0 months from the 1<sup>st<\/sup> MTB presentation. Pts for which the MTB had a diagnostic impact, and having received a treatment following MTB recommendation (based on putative origin or targetable alteration) had increased OS compared to pts with no diagnostic orientation (median OS 18.4 months vs 5.6 months, p=0.003) or having received other treatments (median OS 18.4 vs 4.4 months, p=0.0001). Conclusion: NatCUPMTB provides significant diagnostic and therapeutic benefit in pts with CUP. Early presentation of pts at NatCUPMTB as soon as CUP diagnosis is suspected should be recommended.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-10 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer diagnostics,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Nicolas Jacquin<sup>1<\/sup>, Maud Kamal<sup>2<\/sup>, Ivan Bieche<sup>2<\/sup>, Célia Dupain<sup>2<\/sup>, Isabelle Guillou<sup>2<\/sup>, Linda Larbi-Chérif<sup>2<\/sup>, Etienne Rouleau<sup>3<\/sup>, Julien Masliah Planchon<sup>2<\/sup>, Isabelle Soubeyran<sup>4<\/sup>, Christelle de la Fouchardière<sup>5<\/sup>, Camille Tlemsani<sup>6<\/sup>, Hélène Blons<sup>7<\/sup>, Fabienne Escande<sup>8<\/sup>, Michel Vidaud<sup>6<\/sup>, Jennifer Wong<sup>2<\/sup>, Pierre Saintigny<sup>5<\/sup>, Sandrine Boyault<sup>5<\/sup>, Adrien Buisson<sup>5<\/sup>, Yves Allory<sup>9<\/sup>, Anne Vincent-Salomon<sup>2<\/sup>, Vincent Cockenpot<sup>5<\/sup>, Janick Selves<sup>10<\/sup>, Christophe Le Tourneau<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Sarah Watson<\/b><sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Institut Godinot, Reims, France,<sup>2<\/sup>Institut Curie, Paris, France,<sup>3<\/sup>Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France,<sup>4<\/sup>Institut Bergonié, Bordeaux, France,<sup>5<\/sup>Centre Léon Bérard, Lyon, France,<sup>6<\/sup>Institut Cochin, Paris, France,<sup>7<\/sup>Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou, Paris, France,<sup>8<\/sup>CHU de Lille, Lille, France,<sup>9<\/sup>Institut Curie, Saint Cloud, France,<sup>10<\/sup>CHU de Toulouse, Toulouse, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9cfbe8fb-66f7-4818-8abe-b513412f0c8f","ControlNumber":"2369","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

However, the use of adjuvant therapy for resected stage IB patients remains controversial. This study investigated the differences in prognosis and molecular features between different histopathologic patterns of stage IB non-squamous NSCLC (nsNSCLC) and tried to identify patients who most in need of adjuvant therapy.<br \/>Methods: A total of 215 patients with completely resected pathologic stage IB (tumor size 3-4 cm) nsNSCLC from Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute &#38; Hospital between 2014 and 2018 were included in the study. For 130 patients, genomic profiling of tumor tissues was sequenced by a panel of 9 driver genes (OncoScreen<sup>&#174;<\/sup> Focus CDx Tissue Kit, Burning Rock Biotech) and the molecular risk stratification was assessed by 14-gene quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay (DetermaRx<sup>TM<\/sup>, Burning Rock Biotech).<br \/>Results: Among the 215 patients, 67.9% were solid\/micropapillary-predominant pattern (S\/MP), 40.5% had received platinum-based doublet adjuvant chemotherapy, and 5.1% had received adjuvant targeted therapy with or without chemotherapy. Patients with S\/MP pattern had significantly worse DFS than those with lepidic\/acinar\/papillary-predominant (L\/A\/P) pattern (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.28 to 3.67; P = 0.013). However, neither pattern could benefit from adjuvant therapy. <i>EGFR<\/i> mutation was successfully detected in 75 out of 126 patients (59.5%), and the positive rate in S\/MP pattern was significantly lower than that in L\/A\/P pattern (50.6% vs 79.5%, P = 0.002). However, <i>EGFR<\/i> mutation status was not a prognostic factor for DFS in neither overall population nor different histopathologic patterns. <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant patients showed the trend to benefit from adjuvant targeted-based therapy in the limited samples. Molecular risk stratification was successfully assessed in 99 patients, of which 37.4%, 26.3%, and 36.4% were predicted as molecularly high-risk, intermediate-risk, and low-risk patients, respectively. There were significant differences in the proportion of high- and low-risk patients between S\/MP and L\/A\/P patterns (for high-risk: 46.2% vs 20.6%; for low-risk: 26.2% vs 55.9%; P = 0.009). The high-risk patients had significantly shorter DFS than the low-risk patients (HR, 2.93, 95% CI: 1.31-6.54; P = 0.012), especially those in S\/MP pattern (HR, 3.45, 95% CI: 1.46-8.15; P = 0.017).<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>Our study confirms that S\/MP pattern is a significantly worse prognostic factor for DFS in nsNSCLC and that there are significant differences in molecular features between these two different histopathologic patterns. qPCR-based assay could reliably identify patients with a worse prognosis in S\/MP pattern, suggesting that such patients are most likely to benefit from personalized adjuvant therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-07 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Histopathological pattern,Molecular features,Risk stratification,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dongsheng Yue<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Bin Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Chen Chen<sup><\/sup>, Qiang Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Xinyi Wu<sup><\/sup>, Jiping Xie<sup><\/sup>, Changli Wang<sup><\/sup>, Zhenfa Zhang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Department of lung cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"74ef7c21-3624-4345-98db-b6c49a954b32","ControlNumber":"3384","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

Traditional management consists of local therapies (resection, radiation) for limited lesions and myelosuppressive therapies for systemic disease. Recent studies, however, have identified MAP Kinase pathway mutations in RDD, prompting further research into the utility of targeted agents.<br \/>Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted at a single institution over a 20-year period (2002-2022) of 40 patients with RDD. Inclusion criteria included age &#8805;18 and histopathologic evidence of RDD without obscuring secondary malignancies. Clinical data points included biological gender, age at diagnosis, molecular diagnostics, imaging and therapies administered. Binary data was utilized for statistical analysis and comparison of outcomes by treatment type, time to diagnosis and use of targeted agents.<br \/>Results: In this analysis, 72% of patients were female and 28% male with an average age at diagnosis of 45.8 years, over 50% of whom were diagnosed between 1 and 12 months of presentation. Primary disease was most commonly extranodal (&#62;90%), found in cutaneous, osseous and CNS structures (50%, 36% and 16.6%, respectively). Regarding management, surgery was most common in &#62;36% of patients, followed by steroid and myelosuppressive therapies (25% each), immunotherapy (13.88%) and targeted molecular therapies (11.1%). Disease responses were considered stable if grossly unchanged during serial exam or imaging surveillance, partial if diminished but still present and complete if disease was grossly and radiographically resolved; a partial response or better was observed in &#62;75% of patients. With respect to treatment rendered, stable disease was equally likely between recipients of molecular and conventional (non-molecular) therapy at 25%. Partial responses were higher in molecular therapy recipients (75% as compared to 42%), although complete responses have not yet been observed in this cohort. Patients diagnosed at &#60;1 month from symptom onset had higher rates of disease stability and complete responses compared to those diagnosed at &#62;24 months.<br \/>Conclusions: To our knowledge, this study is the largest of its kind in adult Rosai Dorfman Disease. Early recognition and utilization of targeted molecular therapies, based on our preliminary data, are associated with higher rates of achieving disease stability and at least a partial response. The current absence of complete responses in patients receiving targeted molecular therapy is likely attributable to the still-emerging use of these agents and interim response assessments not yet being completed. Higher complete response rates in targeted agents relative to conventional therapies are anticipated in ongoing analyses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-06 Laboratory correlates for targeted agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MEK inhibitor,BRAF,Molecular diagnosis,Histopathology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Samuel  B.

MAP Kinase and PI3-AKT pathway somatic mutations and\/or fusion genes have been shown to play a significant role in disease pathogenesis. Despite this, molecular sequencing at diagnosis has yet to become a standard of practice.<br \/>Retrospective analysis of 19 patients diagnosed with ECD at a single institution over a twenty-years (2002-2022) was conducted. Inclusion criteria were patients 18 years or older, histopathologic diagnosis of ECD, and clinical correlation of disease. The following was collected for each patient: biological sex, age at diagnosis, molecular testing (if utilized), immunohistochemistry, imaging results, therapies administered and best treatment outcomes. Information was translated into binary data for statistical analysis.<br \/>In this analysis, 47% of patients were females; average age at diagnosis was 51.2 years. 36% of patients were diagnosed within 12 months of symptoms onset. Molecular diagnostics were utilized in 100% of patients, (immunohistochemistry 94%, sequencing 26%). Primary disease was most commonly extranodal (94%), followed by osseous (63%), dermal (52%) and the central nervous system (36%). Treatment consisted of targeted molecular therapy most often (57%), followed by myelosuppressive therapy and steroids (42%), and immunotherapy or radiation (10% each). Disease responses were considered stable if grossly unchanged clinical exam or imaging surveillance, partial (PR) if diminished but still present and complete (CR) if disease was grossly or radiographically resolved. A PR or better was observed in 83% of patients. Stable disease was seen more often in patients treated with conventional therapy (33%) as compared to targeted molecular therapy (11%). PR was higher in targeted therapy recipients (55%). CR was more common with conventional therapy than molecular (66<i>% <\/i>vs 33%).

Targeted molecular therapy utilization by this analysis is associated with higher rates of partial disease response as compared to conventional therapy. The opposite was observed in complete responders. Use of targeted molecular therapies is very recent and higher CR rates are expected in ongoing analyses and longer patient follow-up. Moreover, molecular diagnostics were not routinely employed at diagnosis which delayed the initiation of treatment. Thus, we strongly advocate for early genetic profiling at the time of ECD diagnosis and utilization of targeted therapies when actionable mutations are observed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-06 Laboratory correlates for targeted agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sabrina  R.

IFN score was 1.21-fold higher in ECM to Bone compared to ECP of Uterus (q&#60;0.05). ECM to GU (n=29, HR: 1.59, 570 days, p=0.04) had worse post-Carboplatin survival than ECP (n=3023, 1096 days) while ECM to Lung had better (n=279, HR: 0.73, 1602 days, p=&#60;0.01). ECM to Liver (PD-1\/PD-L1i: n=27, HR: 2.4, 165 days, p=&#60;0.01; Bevacizumab: n=44, HR: 1.5, 286 days, p=0.03) had worse post-tx survival compared to ECP (PD-1\/PD-L1i: n=607, 760 days; Bevacizumab: n=693, 463 days). ECM to GI (n=44, HR: 0.56, 1080 days, p=0.003) and Lung (n=86, HR: 0.70, 768 days, p=0.01) had improved post-Gemcitabine treatment compared to ECP (n=533, 452 days).<br \/>Conclusions: ECM to Bone and GU organs have unique molecular alterations when compared to ECP of the uterus and have lower infiltration of immune cells.

The ecological and evolutionary dynamics responsible for treatment failure are incompletely understood.<br \/><b>Aim &#38; Methods: <\/b>We performed a multi-omic study with a multi-timepoint strategy to examine neoadjuvant treatment response at clonal resolution and in the surrounding tumor microenvironment. EAC samples from chemotherapy responding (REs) and chemotherapy non-responding (NRs) patients with locally advanced EAC were collected at three time points (prior, during, and after neoadjuvant therapy) within the multicenter <i>MEMORI<\/i> trial. Whole exome sequencing (mean depth 300x) was performed on 47 samples from 17 REs and on 24 samples from 10 NRs. Matched RNA sequencing was performed on 53 samples from 17 REs and on 26 samples from 10 NRs. To characterize immune response we performed imaging mass cytometry (IMC) with a 18-marker panel on 26 samples from 9 REs and 16 samples from 6 NRs and T-cell receptor sequencing in 18 RE-samples and 9 NR-samples.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We observed profound changes in mutation signatures over time, characterized by C&#62;A transitions after exposure to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (FOLFOX), which is consistent with earlier observed oxaliplatin induced mutational signatures. Phylogenetic analysis showed no major changes in the clonal make-up during treatment, suggesting phenotypic plasticity rather than clonal evolution caused treatment resistance. EAC samples displayed widespread copy number alterations (CNAs), as previously described. CNAs arising during treatment were significantly more likely to be small, focal alterations rather than large alterations. At the transcriptome level neoadjuvant treatment led to significant changes with significant upregulation of immune and stromal pathways and oncogenic pathways such as <i>KRAS, Hedgehog<\/i> and <i>WNT<\/i>. The presence of immune escape mechanisms (defined as LOH or mutations in HLA, B2M mutations or PDL-1 overexpression) and a lack of clonal T-cell expansions were linked to poor clinical treatment response. Moreover, IMC analyses showed a less activated T-cell phenotype in NRs than in REs throughout treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Using a multi-timepoint approach, we integrated genetic analyses with transcriptomic analyses and analyses of the tumor immune microenvironment for a holistic understanding of treatment resistance. This study identifies profound transcriptional changes during treatment with limited evidence that clonal replacement is the cause, suggesting phenotypic plasticity as a mechanism for therapy resistance. The presence of immune escape, a less activated T-cell phenotype and a lack of clonal T-cell expansions in patients with poor clinical treatment response has high pharmacological relevance and could be exploited via combined immune-chemotherapy treatments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-09 Tumor staging: Correlation of clinical and molecular markers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Resistance,Multiomics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Melissa Barroux<sup>1<\/sup>, Jacob Househam<sup>2<\/sup>, Eszter Lakatos<sup>2<\/sup>, Tahel Ronel<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Ann-Marie Baker<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, Henrike Salié<sup>4<\/sup>, Max Mossner<sup>2<\/sup>, Kane Smith<sup>2<\/sup>, Chris Kimberley<sup>5<\/sup>, Salpie Nowinski<sup>2<\/sup>, Alison Berner<sup>5<\/sup>, Vinaya Gunasri<sup>5<\/sup>, Marnix Jansen<sup>6<\/sup>, Giulio Caravagna<sup>7<\/sup>, Julia Slotta-Huspenina<sup>8<\/sup>, Wilko Weichert<sup>8<\/sup>, Markus Alberstmeier<sup>9<\/sup>, Benny Chain<sup>10<\/sup>, Helmut Friess<sup>11<\/sup>, Bertram Bengsch<sup>12<\/sup>, Roland  M.

The pragmatic molecular classification tool, ProMisE, identifies four molecular subtypes based on next generation sequencing (NGS) for the detection of somatic pathogenic <i>POLE<\/i> mutations, and immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair and p53 proteins. ProMisE provides valuable prognostic and predictive information to direct care, however, multiple molecular results are often received from different time periods and\/or from different centers which can cause delays. Therefore, we developed a classifier that relies on a single DNA-based NGS test with the goal of recapitulating the prognostic value of ProMisE by producing concordant results.<br \/>Methods: Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) EC tumor DNA was sequenced using the clinically validated Imagia Canexia Health Find It<sup>TM<\/sup> amplicon-based next generation sequencing gene panel assay. The 38 gene panel assessed single nucleotide variants (SNVs), indels (insertions and deletions), gene amplification and microsatellite instability (MSI) using 21 MSI loci. To compare to the original ProMisE classifier, we identified somatic mutations in <i>POLE<\/i>, <i>TP53 <\/i>and MSI-High or MS-Stable for molecular classification. Molecular subtypes assigned by both classifiers were assessed for concordance metrics and Kaplan-Meier survival curves.<br \/>Results: The one-step NGS molecular classifier assessed 165 unique patient FFPE EC samples that had previously been assessed by ProMisE. There were 152\/165 cases that were concordant between molecular subtype assignment from the original ProMisE and the one-step NGS assay with a kappa statistic of 0.88 and accuracy of 0.92. There were 13 samples that were discordant (original classifications: 3 <i>POLE<\/i>, 3 MMRd, 2 p53abn, 5 NSMP\/p53wt), which will be reviewed in detail. Results were concordant in 14 of 15 cases (93%) when both diagnostic biopsy and hysterectomy specimens were tested. Molecular subtypes maintained their associations with clinical outcomes (progression free survival, disease specific survival, overall survival).<br \/>Conclusion: The one-step NGS molecular classifier demonstrates high concordance with the original ProMisE classifier including between biopsy and hysterectomy samples. This shows that reliable molecular testing could be obtained from time of first diagnosis. Prognostic value of this new one-step classification tool is maintained. Appropriate interpretation of results is critical, including limiting <i>POLE <\/i>mutation assignment to a confirmed list of pathogenic mutations and correct order of segregation for ECs with more than one molecular feature. Further validation is needed in a larger cohort to implement into standard of care testing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-07 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,Molecular diagnosis,Cancer diagnostics,Predictive biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Melissa K.

Subtyping the disease and identifying the genomic features driving these subtypes are critical for precision oncology for breast cancer. With increasing availability of single cell RNA-seq data and deconvolution methods, there is unmet need for identifying novel tumor-intrinsic subtypes based on deconvoluted tumor-specific expression profiles as well as novel bulk tumor subtypes based on bulk RNA-seq data. Drug response prediction based on tumor-intrinsic subtypes can be also potentially more robust than drug response prediction based on bulk subtypes because currently available CRISPR and drug screening data are mostly based on only cancer cell lines. Therefore, we applied consensus hierarchical clustering, Bayesian Non-negative Matrix Factorization (BayesNMF), and deconvolution methods to 1,058 TCGA breast cancer samples and identified seven bulk expression subtypes (S1-S7) and five tumor-specific expression subtypes (S1-S5). In order to characterize our subtypes, we first performed subtype association with previously characterized subtypes, including PAM50, HR status, and METABRIC IntClust subtypes. Notably, Luminal A and METABRIC IntClust 4ER+ breast cancer was further partitioned into our S1 and S5 bulk subtypes. We characterized the subtypes with pathway activity, TME deconvolution, and subtype-associated driver mutations. Our BayesNMF bulk and tumor-specific subtypes showed stronger association with prognosis than PAM50 subtypes, suggesting potential clinical utility of our subtypes. We projected BayesNMF to DepMap cell lines and CPTAC breast cancer samples to identify subtype-specific vulnerabilities and proteogenomic characterization of our subtypes, respectively. We also developed the method to predict CDK4 selective and CDK6 selective drug response in human breast tumor tissues by training the NMF models with CDK4 and CDK6 dependency scores and gene expression features in the DepMap cell lines. Our tumor-specific S5 subtype had significantly lower CDK4 response scores and significantly higher CDK6 response scores than others suggesting that this subtype, which is primarily triple-negative breast cancer, might be potentially a good subtype for CDK6 selective inhibitors. Additionally, our tumor-specific S4 subtype had significantly higher CDK4 response scores and significantly lower CDK6 response scores than others suggesting that this subtype might be a promising patient population for CDK4 selective inhibitors. We further applied machine learning methods to identify biomarkers that associate with subtypes and CDK4\/CDK6 dependency scores using gene expression, mutations, and CNAs. Overall, our subtyping approach identifies clinically-relevant novel breast cancer subtypes with subtype-specific cancer vulnerabilities and therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-07 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Biomarkers,Machine learning,Cancer genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Julie Karam<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Paul Rejto<sup>2<\/sup>, Jadwiga  R.

Four subtypes are distinguished, characterized by considerable clinical, histologic, and genetic heterogeneity. RMS with fusions of the transcription factor TFCP2 to either FUS or EWSR1 has only recently been observed, but its classification and pathogenesis are unclear. We studied the clinical course, histopathology, and molecular landscape of 12 cases of this new RMS type and determined the functional properties of tumor-specific genetic alterations. Unusually for gene fusion-driven sarcomas, most tumors had highly rearranged genomes, including chromothripsis, and signs of defective homologous recombination DNA repair. All tumors were characterized by extremely high expression of a truncated TERT variant and the receptor tyrosine kinase ALK. The latter was additionally affected by intragenic deletions (33%), which resulted, together with aberrant splicing events, in the expression of shortened ALK variants (58%). Three ALK variants were oncogenic in immortalized cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and after xenotransplantation in mice <i><\/i>and<i> <\/i>responded variably to different ALK inhibitors. Additional recurrent alterations included CDKN2A\/MTAP co-deletions (67%) and mutations in PAPPA2 (25%) encoding an IGFBP5-specific proteinase. DNA methylation analysis of FUS\/EWSR1-TFCP2 RMS, along with 19 other soft-tissue sarcoma types, revealed a close relationship with undifferentiated sarcoma but not with other RMS subtypes, suggesting that FUS\/EWSR1-TFCP2 RMS is a distinct sarcoma entity possibly arising from a different cell of origin than other RMS types. Transduction of TFCP2 fusions into immortalized human cells conferred anchorage-independent growth and blocked late myogenic differentiation. Genes significantly induced in these cells were also highly expressed in patient tumors, including ALK, TERT, and two known regulators of skeletal muscle cells, IGFBP5 and PTH1R. ACT-seq demonstrated direct binding of FUS-TFCP2 to the ALK and TERT gene loci outside their regular promoters, which correlated with the expression of alternative transcript variants. Finally, FUS-TFCP2 appeared to induce a defect in DNA double-strand repair in immortalized cells, rendering them sensitive to treatment with cisplatin.

However, recent NGS-based technology has dramatically increased the characterization of other SRCS entities that share morphological, pathological, and clinical similarity with canonical ES. Currently, these sarcomas are often treated with similar regimens derived from ES. Whether any subsets of these sarcomas might benefit from personalized anti-cancer strategies remains largely unknown.<br \/>Methods: To explore potential therapeutic vulnerabilities, 51 FFPE samples from 49 patients (median age 31 years, 65.3% male) diagnosed as ES or its mimics by conventional pathology review were sent to DNA (OncoScreen&#174;Plus) and RNA sequencing (OncoRNA, Burning Rock Biotech) for genomic and immune signature profiling. Tumor samples were classified into 5 groups based on their similarity with classic ES: (a) Canonical ES (n=12), defined as ES with <i>EWSR1-FLI1<\/i>fusion<i> <\/i>and a primary bone origin; (b) Non-canonical ES, which were found with either non-<i>EWSR1-FLI1 FET-ETS<\/i> fusion, or ES in extra-skeletal sites (n=11); (c) Non-<i>FET-ETS<\/i> fusion SRCS (n=10), defined as SRCS with gene fusions other than <i>FET-ETS <\/i>family; (d) Fusion-negative SRCS (n=4); and (e) non-SRCS, where the diagnosis was primarily suspected as ES but finally re-diagnosed as another histology (n=12).<br \/>Results: The NGS-based diagnosis rectified the pathological diagnosis in 9\/51 samples, including ES misdiagnosed as other (n=3), other misdiagnosed as ES (n=4), Non-<i>FET-ETS<\/i> fusion SRCS misdiagnosed as ES (n=1) and ALK fusion sarcoma misdiagnosed as SRCS (n=1). In the remaining 42 samples, 23 diagnoses were confirmed by both NGS and FISH, while 11 SRCS were negative in both NGS and FISH assay, yielding a concordance of 81.0% (34\/42). In the 8 samples with discordant diagnosis, a definitive diagnosis was achieved by FISH but not NGS in 1 of 8 (12.5%), and vice versa in 7 of 8 (87.5%). Interestingly, genomic profiling revealed that Non-<i>FET-ETS<\/i> fusion SRCS had high frequencies of <i>TP53<\/i> mutations (40%) and copy number loss (including 30% in <i>CD274<\/i> and<i> JAK2<\/i>; 20% in <i>PTCH1<\/i>, <i>CDKN2A\/B<\/i>, and <i>MTAP<\/i>) and featured higher levels of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) (p=0.024) and chromosome instability (p=0.022) than other groups. Remarkably, non-canonical ES demonstrated upregulated <i>PDCD1<\/i> expression (p=0.034). The distribution of immune hot and cold subtypes was comparable among all groups (p=0.334).<br \/>Conclusion: Our study shows that NGS could efficiently facilitate the definitive diagnosis of ES and its mimics. We also revealed a diverse immune-genomic landscape of these SRCS, indicative of potential therapeutic opportunities targeting HRD and immune check-point in specific subtypes of these sarcoma entities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-07 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Molecular profiling,Personalized medicine,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zhusheng Zhang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Qiyuan Bao<sup>1<\/sup>, Junxiang Wen<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhuochao Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Qi Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuhui Shen<sup>1<\/sup>, Lin Shao<sup>2<\/sup>, Bing Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Song-An Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Weibin Zhang<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Shanghai Jiaotong University Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Burning Rock Biotech, Guangzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ad70e09d-2d37-4e10-8c5b-b993d6b41dc3","ControlNumber":"4258","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Z.

We conducted an in-depth analysis using multi-omics data to elucidate the underlying characteristics that lead to differences in clinical outcomes between subtypes.<br \/>Patients and Methods: Immunohistochemistry (IHC, n=252), target exome sequencing (n=422), and whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS, n=189) data generated from 427 patients with SCLC patients were comprehensively analyzed. The differences in the mutation profile, gene expression profile were analyzed according to the IHC-based molecular subtype. Clinical implication was evaluated based on treatment outcomes of individual patients.<br \/>Results: IHC based molecular subtyping revealed a high incidence of ASCL1 subtype (SCLC-A, 56.3%) followed by ASCL1\/NEUROD1 co-expressed (SCLC-trans, 17.9%), NEUROD1 (SCLC-N, 12.3%), POU2F3 (SCLC-P, 9.1%), triple-negative (SCLC-TN, 4.4%) subtypes showing high concordance with WTS-based subtyping. We delineated the SCLC-trans subtype resembling SCLC-A rather than SCLC-N in terms of both gene expression profiles and clinical outcomes. SCLC-TN type was defined as non-significant expression of A, N, P. Favorable overall survival (OS) was observed in SCLC-A compared to SCLC-N (adjusted HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.5-3.9, <i>p <\/i>&#60; 0.001) and SCLC-P (adjusted HR 1.7, 95% CI 0.9-2.9, <i>p <\/i>= 0.087). SCLC-TN showed a similar OS with SCLC-A (adjusted HR 1.2, 95% CI 0.6 -2.7, <i>p<\/i> = 0598). The clinical outcome based on inflamed phenotype, clustered by effector cell gene expression profile which are only found in 5% of SCLC-N but 60% of SCLC-P, was more likely to benefit from first-line immunotherapy treatment than non-inflamed phenotype (<i>p <\/i>= 0.013). Inflammed phenotype demonstrated longer progression-free survival to the first line immunotherapy compared to the non-inflammed phenotype. (10.5 vs 4.3, <i>p<\/i> = 0.013)<br \/>Conclusions: This study provides fundamental data, including the incidence and basic demographics of molecular subtypes of SCLC using both IHC and WTS from a comparably large cohort including potential differences in the distribution of subtypes based on ethnicity. Additionally, our results reveal differences in the underlying biological pathway activities and immunogenicity based on molecular subtype, possibly related to the difference in clinical outcomes, including immunotherapy response.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-07 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: small cell,Molecular subtypes,KRAS,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sehhoon Park<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Tae Hee Hong<sup><\/sup>, Soohyun Hwang<sup><\/sup>, Hyun-Ae Jung<sup><\/sup>, Jong-Mu Sun<sup><\/sup>, Jin Seok Ahn<sup><\/sup>, Myung-Ju Ahn<sup><\/sup>, Jong Ho Cho<sup><\/sup>, Yong Soo Choi<sup><\/sup>, Jhingook Kim<sup><\/sup>, Young Mog Shim<sup><\/sup>, Hong Kwan Kim<sup><\/sup>, Yoon-La Choi<sup><\/sup>, Se-hoon Lee<sup><\/sup>, Keunchil Park<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7a66eeaf-22e7-4966-bb11-c4a0e3572340","ControlNumber":"2637","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.
