Nevertheless, more than 50% patients will present primary resistance or will develop secondary resistance within 12-25 months after treatment initiation. The mechanisms of resistance to ICIs may depend on tumor-intrinsic molecular\/genetic alterations that generate an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (<i>is<\/i>TME). Using <i>In silico<\/i> analyses (TCGA and AACR-GENIE cohorts), and protein expression analysis in our institutional CIMA-CUN cohort, we have shown that &#62;50% LUSC and ~28% LUAD tumors exhibited reduced <i>PTEN<\/i> mRNA\/protein levels. Patients with PTEN-low tumors had higher levels of CXCL10, PD-L1 and PD-L2. In a cohort of stage IV NSCLC patients treated with ICIs, we found that patients with low tumor PTEN levels were significantly associated with worse OS (p=0.021). We have developed and characterized a <i>Pten<\/i>-null LUSC model using UN680 cells, which was also refractory to anti-PD-1 when implanted in syngeneic mice. Pten loss led to a deregulation of multiple pathways related to immunosuppression, with a positive enrichment in &#8220;IL-6\/JAK\/STAT3&#8221; and &#8220;TNF-&#945; via NFkB&#8221; hallmarks, identified by GSEA. Tumors from the <i>Pten-<\/i>null LUSC model were highly metastatic and fibrotic, and secreted TGF-&#946;\/CXCL10, thus favoring conversion of CD4+ lymphocytes into Tregs. Human\/mouse PTEN-low tumors were enriched in Tregs and immunosuppressive genes. Importantly, treatment of mice bearing <i>Pten-<\/i>null tumors with TLR agonists+anti-TGF-&#946;, aimed to alter this <i>is<\/i>TME, led to tumor rejection and immunological memory in 100% of mice. Our results demonstrate that lack of <i>PTEN <\/i>causes immunotherapy resistance in LUSC by establishing an <i>is<\/i>TME that can be reversed therapeutically.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PTEN,Toll-Like Receptors,Immunotherapy Resistance,T regulatory cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Francisco Exposito<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Miriam Redrado<sup>2<\/sup>, Maeva Houry<sup>3<\/sup>, Katherine Hastings<sup>4<\/sup>, Magdalena Molero-Abraham<sup>5<\/sup>, Teresa Lozano<sup>6<\/sup>, Jose  L.

Neoantigen immunoediting drives ICB efficacy, yet how tumor evolution and neoantigen immunogenicity shape treatment response remains poorly understood. To address these questions, we conducted a prospective clinical trial of NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab. We assessed genomic alterations in tumors from 58 patients and performed large-scale immune epitope analyses, before and during treatment (CheckMate153, CA209-153). Tumors were analyzed by whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing. In responding patients, loss of mutation and neoantigen burden early during therapy was associated with clinical benefit. We evaluated the immunogenicity of 1,453 candidate neoantigens and identified 502 neopeptides that bound to MHC I and 196 neopeptides that were immunogenic and recognized by T cells in the setting of nivolumab treatment. These T cell reactive neoantigens were differentially present in clonal populations that underwent distinctive evolutionary trajectories across responders and nonresponders. Mapping these neoantigens to tumor clonal dynamics and clinical response revealed strong selection against immunogenic mutations compared to non-immunogenic mutations. We used this large collection of neoantigens to build ImmunoSEEK, a machine learning-based neoantigen prediction model and validated it using an orthogonal set of neoantigens. Changes in the genomic and neoantigen immunogenicity landscapes were accompanied by temporal changes in the tumor microenvironment. Nivolumab-induced microenvironmental evolution in NSCLC shared some similarities with that in melanoma, yet critical differences in immunologic programs were apparent from comparative network analysis between tumor types. This study provides unprecedented molecular portraits of the genomic and neoantigen landscapes underlying nivolumab&#8217;s mechanism of action.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,Immune checkpoint,Immuno-oncology,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tyler Joseph Alban<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nadeem Riaz<sup>2<\/sup>, Prerana Parthasarathy<sup>1<\/sup>, Vlad Makarov<sup>1<\/sup>, Slav Kendall<sup>3<\/sup>, Seong-Keun Yoo<sup>1<\/sup>, Rachna Shah<sup>3<\/sup>, Nils Weinhold<sup>3<\/sup>, Raghvendra Srivastava<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaoxiao Ma<sup>1<\/sup>, Chirag Krishna<sup>3<\/sup>, Edward Garon<sup>4<\/sup>, Wallace Akerley<sup>5<\/sup>, Ben Creelan<sup>6<\/sup>, Nivedita Aanuren<sup>7<\/sup>, Diego Chowell<sup>8<\/sup>, William Geese<sup>7<\/sup>, Naiyer Rizvi<sup>9<\/sup>, Timothy Chan<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH,<sup>2<\/sup>Radiation Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering, New York, NY,<sup>3<\/sup>Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY,<sup>4<\/sup>University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA,<sup>5<\/sup>University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT,<sup>6<\/sup>Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL,<sup>7<\/sup>Bristol Myers Squibb, New York, NY,<sup>8<\/sup>Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY,<sup>9<\/sup>Columbia University, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"55ac552c-5eee-43ef-8125-de54f9bd4316","ControlNumber":"1780","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

A heterologous chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd68) and self-amplifying mRNA (samRNA)-based individualized neoantigen vaccine regimen in combination with nivolumab 480 mg IV and ipilimumab 30mg SC (NCT03639714) has previously demonstrated safety, durable immunogenicity, and clinical benefit in patients with previously treated metastatic disease. Genomic correlates of response were studied over time in 29 patients (13 MSS-CRC, 13 GEA, 3 NSCLC) to understand novel mechanisms of action. Exome and transcriptome sequencing from archival biopsies was used for neoantigen selection.Monthly circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) samples were collected for monitoring using a comprehensive tumor-na&#239;ve and tumor-informed hybrid-capture based ctDNA assay. Paired pre- and post-vaccine tumor transcriptomes were analyzed for 10 patients with 6 having accompanying DNA T cell receptor &#914; CDR3 repertoire sequencing (TCRseq) in biopsies and longitudinal PBMCs. Prior to vaccination patient tumors were not enriched for immune infiltration or tumor mutation burden (TMB), median 4.3 mut\/Mb (range: 2-17 mut\/Mb). Minimal neoantigen and mutation drift was observed with a median of 92.5% of neoantigens (range: 45-100%) and a median of 84% (range: 24-99%) of individual mutations detected in biopsies and ctDNA. Notably, paired pre- and post-vaccine biopsy gene expression analyses show upregulation in gene signatures associated with immune infiltration aligning with evidence of T cell expansion measured by significantly expanding CDR3 clonotypes (p &#38;lt0.01). Longitudinal TCRseq in PBMCs demonstrate vaccine induced TCR repertoire dynamics and expanding and contracting clones observed in tumor biopsies could be monitored throughout treatment. In 4 patients the most drastic TCR repertoire changes were observed at time points measured after a 2<sup>nd<\/sup> dose of ChAd68. Lastly, we observe evidence of acquired immune evasion through ctDNA monitoring in two patients each following a year of study treatment. One GEA patient acquired HLA-LOH after remaining stable on treatment and one MSS-CRC with a molecular response (MR) for &#38;gt7 months acquired novel biallelic loss-of-function mutations in TAP1 following 1 year of study treatment. We demonstrate that our neoantigen-directed immunotherapy regimen drives durable immune pressure on the tumor in patients with advanced disease where CPI alone has provided minimal benefit. Further, the evidence of acquired resistance supports the induction of immune pressure on tumors following individualized neoantigen vaccination. Comprehensive ctDNA longitudinal monitoring enables real-time assessment of clinical response and acquired resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer vaccine,ctDNA longitudinal monitoring ,Microsatellite stable colorectal cancer,Neoantigens,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Desiree Schenk<sup>1<\/sup>, Rita Zhou<sup>1<\/sup>, Olivia Petrillo<sup>1<\/sup>, Alexis Mantilla<sup>1<\/sup>, Italo Faria do Valle<sup>1<\/sup>, Steven Maron<sup>2<\/sup>, Brian  S.

T cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cells recognize peptides derived from intracellular and surface proteins presented in the context of MHC class I. Targeting mutated oncogenic drivers addresses some of the major obstacles of this modality, in that the antigenic epitope is: 1) tumor-specific, 2) essential for tumor survival, and 3) derived from a stably expressed protein. KRAS is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancers with alterations in codon 12 associated with poor clinical outcomes in a high proportion of colon, lung and pancreatic cancers, as well as many others. To isolate TCRs specific for the peptide derived from the KRAS G12D mutation presented in the context of HLA-A*11:01, one of the most common HLA alleles worldwide, we employed our high-throughput <i>in vitro <\/i>TCR discovery platform. CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells were isolated from healthy donors and co-cultured with autologous antigen-presenting cells exogenously-loaded with mutant KRAS peptides encompassing the G12D mutation. The highest avidity T cells were subsequently identified and enriched by fluorescence-based cell sorting and the corresponding TCR genes isolated by single-cell sequencing and inserted into a lentiviral expression vector. TCR candidates were transduced into primary T cells and prioritized based on functional avidity and specificity (response to titrated peptide-loaded presenting cells and tumor cells endogenously expressing the KRAS G12D antigen) and cytotoxicity (<i>in vitro <\/i>tumor cell killing assays). X-Scan studies, in which each residue of the reference KRAS G12D peptide was systematically substituted by all other amino acids, revealed a highly restrictive TCR recognition motif, suggesting limited risk of promiscuous off-target activation. We engineered both CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells to lentivirally-express candidate TCRs in addition to the genes encoding the CD8&#945;&#946; co-receptor to enhance TCR-HLA class I avidity in CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, with the aim of creating a coordinated CD4 and CD8 T cell response to the same tumor target to promote increased T cell activity and persistence while minimizing T cell exhaustion. Transduced CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells were functional and could be demonstrated to provide help to CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, supporting tumor elimination in several experimental models. In summary, we report a TCR gene therapy approach targeting mutant KRAS G12D-containing peptides with a coordinated CD4 and CD8 T cell response that has a promising efficacy and safety profile. Our work to date supports the planned clinical development of this novel TCR-engineered T cell therapy for treating KRAS-mutant solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,KRAS,T cell,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Cheryl Black<sup>1<\/sup>, James Parsons<sup>1<\/sup>, Anthony Thomas<sup>1<\/sup>, Allison  P.

Here, we sought to understand key T cell intrinsic factors impacting efficacy: CAR T cell expansion, persistence, and homing to the tumor. Using an endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) sequence as a &#8216;barcode&#8217;, we followed individual T cell clonotypes at the single-cell level from pre-manufacture apheresis and infusion products to tumor-involved lymph node and blood at peak and late expansion in 22 adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel, an FDA-approved CD19-CAR T cell immunotherapy, or bispecific CD19\/CD22 CAR T cells on an investigator-initiated trial (NCT03233854). The resulting CAR T cell atlas comprises matched transcriptome (scRNA-seq) and surface protein expression (CITE-seq) for 846,344 cells from 97 samples, with 215,045 unique TCR clonotypes identified, including 8,747 clonotypes that could be traced across 2+ timepoints in CAR mRNA+ cells. This atlas enabled us to ask: &#8220;<i>What were the phenotypes of &#8216;successful&#8217; CAR T cell clonotypes with optimal homing, expansion, and persistence properties at the time of infusion or pre-manufacture apheresis?<\/i>&#8221; We found that successful T cell clonotypes at apheresis had juvenile features, including <i>IL7R<\/i> expression. Conversely, successful clonotypes in the infusion product had elevated interferon pathway activity and effector signatures, including <i>GZMB<\/i> expression. Further, we built a cell-cell interactome using all live cells from on-treatment biopsies and identified a set of 149 specific ligand-receptor pairs significantly enriched in patients who progressed. Finally, we defined dynamics of TCR clonotypes with predicted specificities for viral and self-antigens. These analyses pinpoint the identities of source T cells and infusion CAR T cells with properties impacting efficacy, and also identify ligand-receptor pairs that could be modulated to enhance CAR T cell response in the tumor at the genetic or pharmacological level. <i>This work was supported in part by the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Kite Pharma, and Stanford Cancer Institute.<\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chimeric antigen receptor,Leukemias: acute lymphoblastic,Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zinaida Good<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mark P.

As these cells play critical roles in tumor progression, they are the focus of efforts to develop novel cancer therapeutics. Strategies to inhibit macrophage accumulation to suppress tumor growth by blocking their recruitment from circulation have been only partially effective. In this project, we examined the origins of tumor associated macrophages using lineage tracing, flow cytometry, and single cell sequencing. We found that large proportions of macrophages in subcutaneous and genetically engineered mouse tumors do not derive from Ly6C+ or Ly6C- or CCR2+ monocytes. Instead, a large population of CCR2-Ly6C-F4\/80hi macrophages that are CD206+MerTK+ are profoundly immune suppressive resident macrophages that arise from a transcriptionally related proliferative progenitor subpopulation rather than by trafficking from the circulation. By comparing gene expression profiles of resident and recruited macrophages in subcutaneous, alveolar, central nervous and renal normal and tumor tissues, we identified generic tissue resident macrophage and recruited signatures that reveal that resident macrophages are more immune suppressive than recruited macrophages and are associated with worse outcomes in cancer patients. Tissue resident macrophages express signatures of Myc-driven proliferation, cholesterol metabolism and profound immune suppression while bone marrow derived macrophages express mixed signatures of inflammation and immune suppression. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of c-Kit\/mCsf1R, cMyc and cyclin-dependent kinases suppressed the expansion of these macrophages, thereby limiting their accumulation in tumors, promoting anti-tumor adaptive immunity and inhibiting tumor progression in mouse models of cancer. We identified a novel cKit\/Csf1r\/ Cdk19 inhibitor that suppressed tissue resident macrophage accumulation and potently inhibited tumor growth.<br \/>These results identify tissue resident macrophage progenitor cells as key targets for the development of therapeutic strategies to stimulate anti-cancer immunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Cancer therapy,Macrophages,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hui Chen<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Marc Paradise<sup><\/sup>, Ryan Shepard<sup><\/sup>, Guangfang Wang<sup><\/sup>, Mark Onaitis<sup><\/sup>, Judith Varner<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UCSD Moores Cancer Center, San Diego, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b9f02d01-ecb5-4318-abe3-f9bb768717dd","ControlNumber":"7580","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

GCC19CART, the first clinical candidate from the CoupledCAR solid tumor platform, is designed to overcome the limitations of conventional CAR T-cells in solid tumor malignancies by pairing solid tumor CAR T-cells with CD19 targeting CAR T-cells to amplify proliferation and activation of the solid tumor CAR T component. GCC19CART targets guanylate cyclase-C (GCC) which is expressed in the metastatic lesions of 70%-80% of subjects with colorectal cancers. A Phase 1 investigator-initiated clinical trial is underway in China for patients with relapsed or refractory metastatic colorectal cancer who have received at least 2 prior lines of therapy. Based on a data cutoff on October 20, 2022 21 subjects have been enrolled in 2 dose escalation groups at 5 hospitals in China.<br \/>Methods: Subjects are screened for GCC expression by immunohistochemistry. Eligible subjects undergo leukapheresis, a single dose of lymphodepleting chemotherapy (fludarabine 30mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> and cyclophosphamide 300mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>) 3 days prior to infusion, and then administration of a single infusion of GCC19CART at one of two preassigned doses: 1x10<sup>6<\/sup> or 2x10<sup>6<\/sup> CAR T-cells\/kg. Endpoints are safety and preliminary evidence of efficacy as determined by CT or PET\/CT per RECIST 1.1 or PERCIST 1.0. All responses were confirmed by an independent third-party imaging contract research organization (CRO).<br \/>Results: 13 subjects have been enrolled to dose level 1 (1x10<sup>6<\/sup> cells\/kg) and 8 subjects have been enrolled to dose level 2 (2x10<sup>6<\/sup> cells\/kg). The most common adverse events were cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in 21\/21 subjects (Grade 1 19\/21 (90.48%) or Grade 2 2\/21 (9.52%)) and diarrhea in 21\/21 subjects (Grade 1 6\/21 (28.57%) Grade 2 5\/21 (23.81%) Grade 3 9\/21 (42.86%) or Grade 4 1\/21 (4.76%)). Neurotoxicity was observed in 2\/21 (9.52%) subjects at Grade 3 or 4 and resolved with corticosteroids. The combined overall response rate (ORR) for both dose levels was 28.6% (6\/21). For dose level 1, the overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 was 15.4% (2\/13). Two subjects demonstrated a partial response (PR) while 3 additional subjects had partial metabolic response (PMR) on PET\/CT with stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1. For dose level 2, The ORR per RECIST 1.1 was 50% (4\/8). 4 subjects demonstrated a PR (3 at month 1, 1 at month 3 after being SD at month 1) and 2 additional subjects had PMR on PET\/CT with SD per RECIST 1.1.<br \/>Conclusions: preliminary data show that GCC19CART has meaningful dose dependent clinical activity and an acceptable safety profile in relapsed or refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. This trial is ongoing and updated data will be presented. A Phase 1 trial of GCC19CART in the US under a cleared IND is expected to enroll patients from mid-2022.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Colorectal cancer,Cancer marker,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Naifei Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Chengfei Pu<sup>2<\/sup>, Lingling Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, Ning Li<sup>3<\/sup>, Chang Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Yusheng Huang<sup>4<\/sup>, Suxia Luo<sup>3<\/sup>, Xun Li<sup>5<\/sup>, Zhenzhou Yang<sup>4<\/sup>, Jun Bie<sup>6<\/sup>, Ruihong Zhu<sup>2<\/sup>, Xi Huang<sup>2<\/sup>, Haiyang Tang<sup>2<\/sup>, Tingting Liang<sup>1<\/sup>, Yizhuo Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Beibei Jia<sup>2<\/sup>, Dongqi Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Zhao Wu<sup>2<\/sup>, Yongping Song<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Victor Lu<\/b><sup>7<\/sup>, Lei Xiao<sup>8<\/sup>, Jiuwei Cui<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Innovative Cellular Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China,<sup>4<\/sup>The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China,<sup>5<\/sup>The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China,<sup>6<\/sup>Nanchong Central Hospital, Nanchong, China,<sup>7<\/sup>Innovative Cellular Therapeutics Inc., Rockville, MD,<sup>8<\/sup>Innovative Cellular Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Rockville, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"455f938d-3bd9-4d2f-b0c1-1db127856b85","ControlNumber":"3351","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.
