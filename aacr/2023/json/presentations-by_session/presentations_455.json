[{"Abstract":"Adult-type diffuse gliomas (Glioblastoma (GBM), Astrocytoma, Oligodendroglioma) are the most common malignant brain tumor in adults with dismal prognoses. Recent large-scale genomic studies have established molecular classification of glioma based on coding mutations and copy number variations. However, whole-genome landscape and multi-omics profiles of gliomas are not well analyzed. To understand the multi-omics genetic landscape of gliomas, we performed deep whole-genome sequencing (&#8805; &#215;120 coverage) of 357 cases with adult-type diffuse gliomas (162 GBMs, 96 astrocytomas, 99 oligodendrogliomas) along with EPIC DNA methylation profiling. RNA-seq, whole-genome bisulfate sequencing, and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) were performed on 349, 40, and 40 of these tumors, respectively. Deep WGS delineated a fine view of clonal architecture demonstrating mutational order during tumor initiation of each glioma. Mutational signature varies between clonal and subclonal mutations, supporting a model that tumors acquire genetic alterations by distinct mechanisms based on their developmental stage. Structural variants (SVs) are more frequently detected in higher malignant gliomas. While a complex SV is rare in Astrocytoma and Oligodendroglioma (35% of samples), a large proportion of GBM cases (85%) have complex SV with &#8805; 10 breakpoints, which involves multiple different chromosomes including driver genes. <i>CDKN2A<\/i> homozygous deletions and focal <i>CDK4<\/i> amplifications are often induced by complex SVs in GBM. These results suggest that complex SVs could play a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of GBM. Integrative analysis of transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles by similarity network fusion (SNF) identifies homogenous clusters in each glioma where those clusters are associated with mutational and SV signatures, suggesting that specific cell states may have distinct sensitivities to mutational processes. In oligodendrogliomas, the SNF classification detected a cluster with poor prognosis which has an enrichment of stem cell-like signature by CIBERSORTx deconvolution analysis. ATAC-seq demonstrated distinct features of genome-wide chromatin accessibility in each glioma which may reflect the difference of cell of the origin. Most of the focally amplified genes have open chromatin status suggesting that tumors take advantage of not only gene duplication but also a transcriptional activity to activate driver genes. Our integrated analysis uncovers molecular mechanisms of gliomas which will help to understand glioma-genesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Whole genome sequencing,Multiomics,Brain\/central nervous system cancers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Takuma Nakashima<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yusuke Funakoshi<sup>1<\/sup>, Atsuhito Uneda<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuriko Sugihara<sup>1<\/sup>, Shohei Nambu<sup>2<\/sup>, Manabu Kinoshita<sup>3<\/sup>, Yoshiki Arakawa<sup>4<\/sup>, Shota Tanaka<sup>2<\/sup>, Joji Ishida<sup>5<\/sup>, Ryuta Saito<sup>6<\/sup>, Ryosuke Hanaya<sup>7<\/sup>, Koji Yoshimoto<sup>8<\/sup>, Yoshitaka Narita<sup>9<\/sup>, Hiromichi Suzuki<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Brain Tumor Translational Institute, National Cancer Center Japan, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Neurosurgery, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Neurosurgery, Asahikawa Medical University, Asahikawa, Japan,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Neurosurgery, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Koto, Japan,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Neurosurgery, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Okayama, Japan,<sup>6<\/sup>Department of Neurosurgery, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan,<sup>7<\/sup>Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan,<sup>8<\/sup>Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan,<sup>9<\/sup>Department of Neurosurgery and Neuro-Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"90f85781-6227-4dc4-9ffd-331de9f91179","ControlNumber":"730","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

MRI-defined contrast-enhancing (CE) tumor burden serves as the clinical standard that guides maximal surgical resection and post-therapy response assessment. However, HGGs also comprise an invasive non-enhancing (NE) tumor margin that extends beyond the CE core and harbors the cells that contribute to recurrence. Sampling restrictions have hindered the comprehensive study of these NE HGG cell populations driving tumor progression. Herein, we present an integrated multi-omic analysis of 313 spatially matched multi-regional CE and NE tumor biopsies from 68 HGG patients, performing whole exome and RNA sequencing of both IDH wild-type and IDH mutant HGGs. We report spatially restricted molecular profiles in IDH-mutant HGG, highlighting a concern for sampling bias given the importance of molecular diagnosis and prognostication in IDH-mutant HGG. Regardless of IDH status, we found that NE tumor regions harbored the highest proportion of private mutations, which reflects an increased development of regional genomic complexity in infiltrative tumor. The multiregional genomic profiling of our IDH wild-type HGG cohort reveals that <i>EGFR<\/i> and <i>NF1<\/i> somatic alterations occur as mutually exclusive events in 98.7% of tumors. However, we resolved rare low allele frequency co-alterations of <i>EGFR <\/i>and <i>NF1<\/i> within the NE region. We find this co-occurrence enriched in recurrent tumors, pointing to the early emergence of<i> NF1<\/i> inactivation in the NE regions. We constructed genomic models predictive of recurrent disease from both NE and CE regions, which highlight the occurrence of clonal <i>EGFR<\/i> copy number alterations and <i>NF1 <\/i>loss as clonal or subclonal events, respectively, emphasizing the regional and temporal complexity of well-studied canonical driver alterations. We detailed the spatially unique acquisition of multiple distinct <i>EGFR<\/i> alterations giving rise to intra-tumoral <i>EGFR<\/i> mosaicism, a challenge in the implementation of EGFR directed therapies. Our study also identified two transcriptomic clusters delineated by the significant overrepresentation of neuronal (NEU) and glycolytic\/plurimetabolic (GPM) pathway-based functional states in the NE region. NE regions of the NEU subtype harbor the greatest proportion of private mutations, suggesting these infiltrative tumor cells accumulate alterations without clonal expansion. GPM populations conversely displayed a less branched phylogeny and were transcriptionally enriched in immune cell signatures. This phenotypic dichotomy between GPM and NEU populations supports the growing body of evidence that invasive GBM cells either take on a neuronal phenotype for active invasion or a more metabolic phenotype involving interaction with astrocytes, other glial cells, and infiltrating immune cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioma,Genomics,RNA sequencing,Biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mylan  R.

We hypothesized that an unbiased approach, combining whole-genome (WGS) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq), could overcome this and lead to a more comprehensive understanding of these diseases. While prior studies have evaluated WGS and RNAseq in pediatric cancers, few focused primarily on metastatic or relapsed disease. We also placed special focus on longitudinal profiling of patients, including with additional deep sequencing, to capture tumor evolution at the primary and metastatic sites, and to quantify the utility of resampling.<br \/>We assembled a cohort of 191 high-risk pediatric oncology patients, including solid tumors, CNS tumors, and leukemias\/lymphomas. We have representation of patients with relapsed\/refractory disease (68), metastatic disease at diagnosis (10), rare diagnoses (19), prior cancer history, and estimated overall survival &#60;50%. We characterized 280 samples with WGS (tumor ~60X; germline ~30X) and\/or RNAseq (tumor, polyA selected, &#8805;20 million reads), including multiple samples taken from 85 patients at different time points (diagnosis, resection, relapse, etc.). Variants (SNVs), structural rearrangements (SVs), mutational signatures, and copy-number alterations (CNAs) were identified using WGS. RNAseq was used to profile gene expression outliers, gene fusions, and expression of variants identified by WGS. The integrated results were used to prioritize potentially actionable variants for each patient. For 20 patients (44 samples), we performed targeted deep sequencing of the DNA (~500X) to profile tumor evolution that cannot be captured by WGS.<br \/>Multiple sampling from the same patient identified drastic spatial and temporal differences in the genomes and transcriptomes of these tumors. Using the Jaccard index as a measure of concordance between samples shows dynamic changes between samples collected at different time points across multiple modalities (range 0-1, 1 is identical); SNVs ranged from 0.01-0.79, SVs 0.01-0.73, major CNAs 0.07-0.99, minor CNAs 0.38-0.99, up expression outliers 0.12-0.56, down expression outliers 0.04-0.54, and fusions 0-1. Potentially biologically significant differences in therapy-induced mutations by platinum agents were also observed, highlighting the impact of therapy on tumor evolution. Clonal architectures were extracted from deep resequencing and show extensive spatial, temporal, and metastatic heterogeneity in these rare and highly aggressive malignancies that is not captured by WGS alone. Identifying clinically relevant evolution remains a challenge in most patients, but our results suggest that resampling of pediatric tumors at relapse or metastasis will be important for the effectiveness of targeted therapies in the future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Whole genome sequencing,RNA sequencing,Tumor evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Henry  J.

In most instances, these mutations are inconsequential to cellular fitness or to overall health. However, some mutations can result in a cell having a fitness advantage over its surroundings, enabling proliferation. In the blood, this proliferation - known as clonal hematopoiesis (CH) - is associated with an increased risk of hematologic malignancies, most notably leukemia, and is commonly observed in the elderly. People with Down syndrome (DS) also exhibit CH and have a markedly higher risk of leukemia (up to 400x); therefore, we investigated CH in people with DS to understand how mutations in the blood can lead to disrupted hematopoiesis and lead to varying susceptibility, onset, and severity of hematologic malignancies. To detect CH, I used a rare-mutation detection technique called DuplexSeq to analyze leukocytic genomic DNA from blood draws. This targeted-sequencing tool spans 37 genes implicated in leukemia - including leukemias seen in those with DS - and implements a double-stranded tag to incorporate mutational data from both DNA strands, enabling higher sensitivity than most sequencing methods. We characterized detected mutations using bioinformatic pipelines, various databases, and statistical methods. By comparing CH between people with and without DS, we observe an overrepresentation of protein-altering mutations in people with DS in genes important for hematopoiesis. Notably, people with DS exclusively harbor CH with <i>JAK2<\/i> mutations, many of which have been associated with myeloid proliferative neoplasms. Mutations in <i>NPM1<\/i> that have been previously seen in cancer are also exclusively observed in people with DS with potential to lead to differentiation block, a hallmark of leukemia. Finally, mutations with the highest variant allele frequency in <i>TET2<\/i> are largely observed in people with DS, indicating preferential expansion in the DS context. These fledgling expansions in <i>TET2<\/i> may be indicative of modified hematopoietic differentiation. Ongoing work is centered around understanding the consequences of these mutations and how they distinguish phenotypes among people with DS. Using a database for DS research, we are performing multi-omics analyses to understand which biological pathways may be disrupted in the same individuals with CH of interest. Additionally, we will use mouse models of DS to investigate the selective advantage of the observed mutations in the DS context, how they impact differentiation fate, and how cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors can influence clonal expansions. Overall, these studies offer a means by which risk of hematologic malignancies can be monitored by CH with elucidation of potential mechanisms. By characterizing CH, early markers of disrupted hematopoiesis can be established to determine susceptibility of leukemia and be used to monitor those who are most at risk.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer risk,Differentiation,Down Syndrome,Clonal Hematopoiesis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Edward  J.

Moreover, synchronous multiple pancreatic cancers were often reported. One of the long-standing issues about such synchronous and\/or metachronous multiple pancreatic cancers is their clonal origins. In this study, we aimed to reveal the origin of multiple pancreatic cancers using an unbiased detection of somatic mutations in primary and metachronous cancers as well as adjacent precursor lesions.<br \/>Methods: Serially obtained formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded surgical specimens from 18 patients who had undergone curative surgery for an early-stage pancreatic cancer were subjected to laser microdissection for the enrichment of tumor and precancerous lesions, from which DNA was extracted and analyzed for somatic mutations using whole-exome sequencing (WES) with matched normal DNA. Based on shared and private mutations across different samples, we interrogated history of clonal evolution of these lesions.<br \/>Results: We analyzed 18 patients with multiple pancreatic cancers of 2 metachronous and synchronous, 14 metachronous, and 2 synchronous tumors. In metachronous cases, pathology for primary cancer were margin-negative in all patients, and the median interval between the initial and second surgery was 38.9 months (7 - 85 months). In addition, a total of 20 pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) from 5 of these cases were analyzed. We identified a median of 66 (range: 31-232) and 20 (14-42) somatic mutations in cancer and PanIN lesions, respectively. None of the patients have known pathogenic germline variants. All samples had one or more driver mutations. In most cases (N=17), sharing many somatic mutations, multiple tumors had a common clonal origin. In another synchronous case, the synchronous tumors shared only one mutation, suggesting that they were clonally independent tumors. By contrast, none of the mutations other than hotspot KRAS mutations were shared between precursor and cancer lesions. While multiple independent clones were observed in precancerous lesions, most of multiple cancers originated from a common ancestor. Moreover, negative pathology of the margins at the initial surgery suggested that those multiple lesions arose from distant dissemination or metastasis, rather than contiguous, intraductal invasion.<br \/>Conclusions: In conclusion, our study suggests that even early pancreatic cancer might be disseminated within the pancreas and contribute to synchronous and metachronous cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tomonori Hirano<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nobuyuki Kakiuchi<sup>1<\/sup>, Yasuhide Takeuchi<sup>2<\/sup>, Tomomi Nishimura<sup>1<\/sup>, Toshihiko Masui<sup>3<\/sup>, Kazuyuki Nagai<sup>3<\/sup>, Takayuki Anazawa<sup>3<\/sup>, Sachiko Minamigushi<sup>2<\/sup>, Hironori Haga<sup>2<\/sup>, Norimitsu Uza<sup>4<\/sup>, Hiroshi Seno<sup>4<\/sup>, Yuzo Kodama<sup>5<\/sup>, Atsuhiro Masuda<sup>5<\/sup>, Takeshi Tanaka<sup>5<\/sup>, Seishi Ogawa<sup>1<\/sup>, Hiroko Tanaka<sup>6<\/sup>, Satoru Miyano<sup>6<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto Univ.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) exhibits complex mutational spectrum without common oncogenic drivers yet displays consistent loss of large chromosomal regions. Here, we characterize selection pressures that maintain a recurrently deleted region of chromosome 4p in TNBC. We used bulk WGS phylogenetic analysis of TNCB PT\/PDX panel to show that chr4p deletion is an early event in tumor evolution. We used scRNAseq gene expression and inferred copy number analysis to show that chr4p loss is associated with a proliferative state. This finding was confirmed by a combination of RNA <i>in situ<\/i> hybridization and immunofluorescence. We then tested the dosage sensitivity of genes residing within this region by individual and dual overexpression in TNBC PDX-derived cell lines and control normal cell line by assessing their effect on cell proliferation. The overexpression of genes within chr4p elicited a strong cell proliferation defect in cancer but not normal cell line models. We also characterized an unknown gene within chr4p region as a novel member of the STRIPAK complex. Genome-wide pooled ORFeome library screens identified a global pattern of background-specific dosage sensitive regions. Our study shows that large chromosomal deletions are maintained due to evolutionary early genetic network rewiring rendering multiple genes within such regions to be dosage sensitive. Ultimately, this work enhances our understanding of genetic events that modulate TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Cancer genomics,Aneuploidy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Elena Kuzmin<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jean Monlong<sup>1<\/sup>, Mathieu Bourgey<sup>1<\/sup>, Tom Lesluyes<sup>2<\/sup>, Toby Barker<sup>2<\/sup>, Genevieve Morin<sup>1<\/sup>, Dongmei Zou<sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Schwartz<sup>1<\/sup>, Yang Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Alain Pacis<sup>1<\/sup>, Constanza Martinez<sup>1<\/sup>, Hellen Kuasne<sup>1<\/sup>, Anne-Marie Fortier<sup>1<\/sup>, Rui Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Claudia Kleinman<sup>1<\/sup>, Sidong Huang<sup>1<\/sup>, Peter van Loo<sup>3<\/sup>, Jiannis Ragoussis<sup>1<\/sup>, Guillaume Bourque<sup>1<\/sup>, Morag Park<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada,<sup>2<\/sup>The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom,<sup>3<\/sup>MD Anderson Cancer Centre, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a74976c9-3135-467c-89ad-36c7178a4501","ControlNumber":"5087","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>E.

The pathogenesis of HGSC had remained obscure until the identification of its tubal origin; however, the carcinogenesis process remains largely underexplored. Meanwhile, targeted therapy using poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of HGSCs and emphasizes the importance of patient stratification. Nonetheless, current clinical trials use different assays and a consensus approach for patient stratification is still lacking.<br \/>In this study, whole genome sequencing technique was used to profile tumor-normal sample pairs, including some related tumors collected from different anatomical sites. This yields a multi-sample cohort comprising 55 pre-treatment samples from 33 HGSC patients and is suitable for addressing questions about molecular stratification and tumor pathogenesis.<br \/>We first recapitulated two reported HGSC subgroups (H-HRD and H-FBI) in our cohort. Comprehensive analyses were conducted on genomic scars ranging from mutations, indels, structural variants and copy numbers. Our data suggests that the genomic subgroups are characterized by different extent and onset timing of homologous recombination repair defect (HRD) as well as CCNE1 activation. Of note, H-HRD group showed higher levels of copy number-based HRD score, which often serves as a surrogate biomarker for PARP inhibitor treatment response.<br \/>On the other hand, tumor evolutionary trajectory was reconstructed based on in silico methods capable of inferring relative timing of genetic alterations. This highlights an early bifurcation of carcinogenesis paths in this HGSC dichotomy, despite a common scenario of a very early TP53 mutation, an often early whole genome duplication and a chromosomal instability phenotype seen eventually.<br \/>Overall, these findings corroborate the concept of tumor-intrinsic genomic phenotypes by providing mechanistic underpinnings from the aspect of tumor evolution. This provides the rationale for studying HGSC disease biology in different contexts and formulating questions about subtype-specific pathogenesis and vulnerabilities. Translationally, it also holds the promise for better identifying the patient subset that might benefit from PARP inhibitor treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Whole genome sequencing,Tumor evolution,Tumor heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Siao-Han Wong<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kai Doberstein<sup>2<\/sup>, Frederik Marmé<sup>2<\/sup>, Benedikt Brors<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany,<sup>2<\/sup>Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"935f8992-04fd-4a88-8831-b7ae0a899413","ControlNumber":"6788","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Clinical factors and molecular characteristics may impact therapeutics and prognosis. Scientific studies have uncovered significant aberrations, including critical genes and pathways. Despite these efforts, few studies have utilized similar sample sizes to TCGA, heterogeneous populations and integrative clinical data to compare their reported genomic changes, even though little is known about the tumor microenvironment and its significance for colorectal tumorigenesis. Methods: Clinical and DNA genomic data from 262 colorectal tumor\/normal DNA samples were obtained for whole exome sequencing analysis from the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network and two colorectal tissue samples for Spatial Transcriptomics profiling from the USC colorectal cancer Moonshot project. Whole Exome Sequencing data analysis was used for identifying genetic alterations. Samples were stratified based on microsatellite instability, age group, anatomical subsites, and histological subtypes. Emphasis was given to comparing molecular characteristics among Hispanic\/Latino patients since their reported higher mortality and cancer disparities. Mutation frequencies from our cohort were compared to those from the TCGA. An ongoing spatial transcriptomics analysis consists in processing two fresh-frozen tissue samples through the visium spatial gene expression library using standard short-read sequencing. Results: Tumor molecular profiling revealed 20 genes significantly mutated. We found differences in gene mutation frequencies among our samples, highlighting APC (60%), TP53 (56%), TTN (49%), and KRAS (44%) gene mutations. In comparison with TCGA data, in addition to the expected APC, TP53, PIK3CA, and KRAS mutations, we found frequent mutations in POLE and TTN. To assess the basis for the considerably different mutation rates, we evaluated MSI. Among the 262 tumors, 41 (16%) had high levels of MSI, 2 (1%) had low levels of MSI (MSI-L), and 215 (82%) were microsatellite stable (MSS). Cancer heterogeneity was reported among tumors with different characteristics such as age group, anatomical subsite, and histological subtypes. The ongoing spatial transcriptomics analysis that will be ready before the annual meeting will identify cellular populations and map immunological and inflammatory signals in the microenvironment. Conclusions: Our study reveals the impact of molecularly profiling tumors using considerable sample sizes and stratified samples in several subgroups.

Almost all FLC patients present a somatic heterozygous deletion in chromosome 19p13.12, <i>DNAJB1::PRKACA<\/i>, which is sufficient to drive FLC in mice. A few studies comparing FLC tumors with adjacent non-transformed liver (normal) samples revealed many transcriptional differences. However, there were done in very small datasets and analyzed using different bioinformatic methods, resulting in just 18-47% agreement between them. This study aims to comprehensively characterize the transcriptome of FLC at bulk and spatial single-cell resolution.<br \/>The whole transcriptome of 109 FLC frozen patient samples, the largest RNA-seq dataset of FLC to date, was sequenced using different library preparation and ribosomal depletion methods. Only paired tumor and normal tissue samples resected from the same patient were used and divided into two groups: exploration (3 datasets, 67 samples) and testing (2 datasets, 17 samples). Additionally, as external validation datasets, RNA-seq samples from previously published studies were collected, including Sorenson <i>et al<\/i>. (FLC: 26, normal: 9, paired: 8), the TCGA-LIHC study (FLC: 6, normal: 1, paired: 1), Hirsch <i>et al<\/i>. (FLC: 15, normal: 3, paired: 0) and Francisco <i>et al<\/i>. (FLC: 27, normal: 10, paired: 9). All were reanalyzed using state-of-the-art bioinformatic methods: mapped to the Human Genome GRCh38.103 and transcripts quantified using Salmon 1.6.0, unsupervised clustering exploration using PCA, tSNE and UMAP, differential expression calculated using DESeq2 1.28.1, and checking for detectability and consistency among datasets. We found 857 up- and 988 down-regulated genes presenting the same dysregulation in the exploration datasets and confirmed in the testing and external datasets. We call these genes the transcriptional FLC signature.<br \/>The FLC signature was further characterized by comparing it with the genes differentially expressed in other liver cancers: hepatocellular carcinoma (41 paired samples), hepatoblastoma (22 paired samples), and cholangiocarcinoma (27 paired samples). We found 276 up- and 352 down-regulated genes altered in other liver cancers as well as FLC, but 156 up- and 68 down-regulated only in FLC. The 112 genes with the strongest dysregulation (56 up and 56 down) were used for a MERFISH screening, providing for the first time a single-cell spatial transcriptomic characterization of FLC. This showed clear differential expression patterns in tumor, normal, stromal, and infiltrating immune cells, allowing the identification of how different cell types contribute to the transcriptional FLC signature.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Liver cancer,Fusion proteins,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>David Requena<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Aldhair Medico<sup>1<\/sup>, Luis  F.

More thorough characterization of mutational processes and development of clones is possible with single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) of normal pancreas tissue. We developed a custom panel with 596 amplicons targeting over 200 genes known to be important in PDAC for use with Mission Bio&#8217;s Tapestri platform. We have recently optimized this method with nuclei which have been extracted from thirty frozen normal pancreas tissues, each from a different patient. Of these tissues, twenty-five were derived from rapid autopsies of patients with brain tumors to minimize the possibility of tumor cells being present in the pancreas. Normal pancreas tissue was verified by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Nuclei were extracted using the S2 Genomics Singulator 100 and counted with DAPI using the Countess 3 FL to ensure the concentration was adequate and that the sample was clean without excessive debris before library preparation and sequencing. Bulk whole exome sequencing (WES) and digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) were performed on several of these sample to validate certain mutations seen in scDNA-seq. Patients of a variety of ages ranging from five to 74 and with various risk factors including smoking and diabetes were chosen to better understand the impact on clonal expansion and genetic patterns present in normal pancreas tissue. For each of the thirty samples, an average of 2464 good quality nuclei were sequenced with over 70 reads per cell per amplicon on average. Mutations that were present in high quantities of cells were confirmed with WES and ddPCR. We found that older patients and patients that either smoke or those with diabetes had not only an increased number of mutations, but each individual cell, on average, had a significantly higher mutation count. The associated clones were also much greater in size in the higher-risk patients&#8217; tissues. Furthermore, there was an increase in heterogeneity in the form of mutually exclusive clusters of cells. These results highlight the effects of various risk factors on normal pancreas tissue and potentially describe novel mechanisms of tumorigenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Sequencing,Single cell,Tumor evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Elias-Ramzey  R.

Other morphological tumor types occurring in association with classic HLRCC tumors as independent neoplasias in this syndrome, have not been clearly recognized and described. We describe four patients with known HLRCC syndrome with confirmed germ line mutation who developed benign oncocytic renal tumors. Since HLRCC can also be oncocytic in many instances, it is important to be aware of the possible benign oncocytic tumors in this patient group.<br \/>Design: Four patients with known positive germ line FH mutation and known HLRCC syndrome developed associated or new oncocytic tumors. All tumors were morphologically evaluated, IHC staining was done for FH, 2SC, CKIT, CK7, PAX8 and molecular studies were performed with TSO-500 for the evaluation of other genes. Clinicopathological correlation was done in all cases.<br \/>Results: The tumors had been identified radiologically and were suspicious for malignancy. Age range was 37-73 years, and all the patients were female. Two patients had coexistent HLRCC cancers while two only had the oncocytomas. Localization was left kidney for all the masses, which were brown in color and well circumscribed and varied in size from 0.7 to 4 cm. In one patient, four separate masses were identified with different locations and sizes, but with the same morphology. This specific patient presented with two additional masses in the opposite kidney later. Tumors were composed of large oncocytic cells with prominent granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and dark pyknotic nuclei. No evidence of atypia, mitosis or necrosis was found. FH was positive, 2SC and CK7 were negative on IHC stains, whereas CKIT showed diffuse membranous positivity. Tumors were diagnosed as oncocytomas. All patients were positive for FH germ line mutation and the mutation was also identified in the tissues. Other molecular studies on the patient with multiple tumors showed additional pathogenic ERCC2 inactivating mutation, suggesting germline, which is rarely encountered in kidney tumors. All the patients are alive and free of disease up to 10 years after diagnosis.<br \/>Conclusion: HLRCC cancers can have a variety of morphologic patterns and frequently have oncocytic features. Clinical information, genetic testing and special techniques are helpful in the diagnosis of these high-grade tumors. Recognizing that other benign indolent tumors with oncocytic features can occur in this syndrome is important to avoid errors in diagnosis and treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kidney cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dilara Akbulut<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mark Ball<sup>2<\/sup>, Mark Raffeld<sup>1<\/sup>, Marston Linehan<sup>2<\/sup>, Maria  J.
