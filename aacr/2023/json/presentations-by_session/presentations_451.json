[{"Abstract":"Background: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can be detected in more than 90% of NPC patients in Hong Kong. It has been shown that EBV infection could hijack the human epigenome in B cell lymphoma and EBV+ gastric cancer, however, the role of EBV in epigenetic dysregulation remains largely unknown in NPC. Recently, our epigenomic landscape study demonstrated EBV was associated with changes of chromatin accessibility in NPC, which were largely involved in the binding sites of CTCF, a master regulator of chromosome organization. Therefore, we aim to further characterize the 3D chromatin structure in NPC.<br \/>Methods: We used the Hi-C (Omni-C Seq) to profile the chromatin interactions in the EBV-positive (EBV+) NPC, EBV-negative (EBV-) NPC, and normal immortalized epithelial (NPE) cell lines. The Omni-C Seq data were integrated with the ATAC-Seq, RNA-Seq, and CUT&#38;RUN-Seq data. The histone markers including H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3, were applied to classify the active and inactive status of the chromatins. The chromatin looping and topologically associated domains (TADs) were defined by the CTCF binding sites.<br \/>Results: We observed a much larger compartmentalization size in EBV+ NPC with a consistent increase of active to inactive (A to B) compartments, compared to NPE and EBV- NPC. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that these changes potentially influenced immune response, cell differentiation and development, metabolism, ERBB pathway, and calcium signaling transduction. In addition to the changes in compartmentalization, we observed a reduction of CTCF binding signals at the TADs boundaries and the loss of chromatin looping at the 10kb resolution. Consistently, the aggregate peak analysis has shown a significant reduction of the CTCF anchor, indicating the abandonment of architectural CTCF in EBV+ NPC. More importantly, we found EBV tethering to the host chromatins. In the EBV genome, the tethering sites were often located at the regions associated with OriP, EBNA1, and BARTs. In the human genome, the tethering sites were dramatically enriched in the inactive to active (B to A) compartments, which were highly associated with the enhancer regions with H3K27ac. We identified a specific target gene <i>CD74<\/i> with EBV tethering at the nearby super-enhancer region. Our results suggest the upregulation of <i>CD74 <\/i>could be controlled via remodulating the host 3D genome in EBV+ NPC. The spatial transcriptome analysis indicated that the expression of CD74 was highly correlated with HLA-DRA. The spatial analysis further showed that the NPC patients with upregulated HLA-DRA often had <i>de novo<\/i> distant metastasis after treatment (<i>p<\/i>=0.007).<br \/>Conclusions: The EBV tethering to the host genome has a significant impact on host 3D genome organization, affecting chromatin accessibility and gene regulation, providing survival<br \/>advantages of cancer cell growth and potentially contributing to immune suppression and metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-04 Epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenomics,Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC),3D genome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dittman Lai-Shun Chung<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Larry Ka-Yue Chow<sup><\/sup>, Wei Dai<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Department of Clinical Oncology, University of Hong Kong, The - Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, Hong Kong, Hong Kong","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b1d91709-4c59-4c66-8e3f-304e1d0a72a7","ControlNumber":"1839","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

Unlike the ChIP assay, CUT&#38;RUN is free from formaldehyde cross-linking, chromatin fragmentation, and immunoprecipitation. Previously, we have shown that, compared to ChIP, CUT&#38;RUN requires fewer starting cells (100K), has a much faster protocol (one day from cells to DNA), generates lower background signal (requires less sequencing depth), and offers spike-in control DNA for effective normalization of signal between samples and between experiments. We recently updated the CST CUT&#38;RUN Assay Kit for use with 5,000-20,000 cells and added protocols for fixed cells and tissue. I will discuss the basics of the CUT&#38;RUN assay and important factors to consider when setting up your experiment. In addition, I will provide data showing the versatility of this assay for mapping various histone modifications, transcription factor, and transcription cofactor binding across multiple sample types.

Many studies revealed the loss of ARID1A promotes tumor progression by activating PI3K-Akt signaling, but other pathways have not yet been fully elucidated. By analyzing RNA sequencing data and ATAC-seq data with ARID1A wild-type cell lines HCT116 and isogenic ARID1A Q456*\/Q456* which has truncation mutations for ARID1A, we investigated the alterations of epigenomic and transcriptomic characteristics according to the loss of ARID1A. The overall openness of chromatin decreased in ARID1A Q456*\/Q456* cells. Since SWI\/SNF complex regulates chromatin structure and gene expression accordingly, we analyzed genes whose change of RNA expression and openness of chromatin in the same direction. The results showed 109 upregulated genes and 715 downregulated genes compared to wild type cell line with P<sub>adj<\/sub> &#60; 0.05, |log2FC| &#62; 0.58 from both RNA sequencing and ATAC-seq. To determine which gene sets are activated in the ARID1A-deficient cell line, the differentially expressed genes with consistent chromatin openness were subjected to Gene Ontology analysis. The upregulated genes in the ARID1A-deficient cell line were enriched in &#8216;Cell proliferation&#8217; and &#8216;TGF-&#946; signaling&#8217;. In addition, the expression of representative genes associated with TGF-&#946; signaling increased in ARID1A-deficient cells.

Aggressive prostate cancer is typically treated with androgen depletion therapy which often results in the formation of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that regulates hundreds of target genes and is responsible for the differentiation and function of normal prostate epithelial cells. In addition to AR, multiple other TFs that bind to distal enhancers have been implicated in PC, such as FOXA1, MYC and HOXB13. Understanding the role of these distal regulators is paramount in PC.<br \/>Methods: To study the changes in chromatin conformation in prostate cancer progression, we have sequenced clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), PC and CRPC samples using Hi-C sequencing. From each group 6 samples were sequenced with a total of 18 samples in the cohort. In addition, we have combined a multi omics cohort consisting of chromatin accessibility, transcriptome and methylome sequencing data from matching samples. Together these data types allow us to map out the regulatory networks in PC and CRPC by probing the distal active regulatory sites and their interactions. To account for artifacts caused by genomic aberrations in cancer samples we have established a pipeline for normalizing these effects in HiC-data.<br \/>Results: Overall topologically associated domains (TADs) and A\/B-compartments remain stable between the groups. However, local changes of compartments in loci of key genes, such as AKR1C3 and FOXA1 correlate with their gene expression. We detect differential loops between sample groups and these changes are associated with gene expression alterations in PCs. Distal enhancers of PC up-regulated genes are enriched for FOXA1 and HOXB13. Interestingly, up-regulated loops in CRPC are enriched for FOXA1 and HOXB13, while no systematic effect on gene expression is seen on a genome wide scale, apart from genes such as AR and CENPE whose expression correlates strongly with their association to distal enhancers. We also detect enhancer hijacking events in driver genes. One example is the recurrent ETV1-MIPOL1 fusion, where promoter of ETV1 forms contacts with FOXA1 enhancer regions.<br \/>Conclusions: Alterations in loop structures are strongly associated with regulatory programs that have been previously implicated in PC, including regulation by FOXA1, HOXB13 and other transcription factors. This highlights the importance of chromatin conformation in facilitating the effects of regulatory programs that rely on distal enhancers in PC. These changes appear more systematic in untreated PCs, whilst CRPCs exhibit more heterogeneity in chromatin conformation across the samples.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-01 Chromatin structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Epigenomics,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tuomo Virtanen<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Ebrahim Afyounian<sup><\/sup>, Riikka Nurminen<sup><\/sup>, Teuvo Tammela<sup><\/sup>, Tapio Visakorpi<sup><\/sup>, Juha Kesseli<sup><\/sup>, Kirsi Rautajoki<sup><\/sup>, Matti Nykter<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Tampere University, Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere, Finland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4b4d6f01-c2c6-46e3-a6e5-5e6cfb51ef3a","ControlNumber":"3333","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

Aging is a well-established risk factor for lung cancer development. However, our understanding of how the aging process affects lung cancer remains cripplingly small. In this study, we aim to bridge this gap by evaluating the effects of glucocorticoid hormones (e.g. cortisol), which become chronically upregulated during the aging process, in lung cancer cells. Phenotypically, our studies revealed that chronic exposure to age-related levels of cortisol trigger a mesenchymal-like senescent state in lung cancer cells that favors motility and invasiveness. Acquisition of pro-aggressive features are generally recognized to be driven by epigenetic regulation. Epigenetic regulation occurs at several levels, but perhaps one of the most fundamental levels is nucleosome remodeling via histone variants and their cognate chaperones. Histone H3 variants are critical regulators of nucleosome stability and have a highly specialized histone chaperone network when compared to other histones. Strikingly, we observed that chronic exposure of lung cancer cells to cortisol leads to a pronounced decline in canonical histone levels, which was accompanied by a 40% increase in chromatin accessibility genome-wide. Chromatin accessibility by transcriptional machinery is heavily influenced by histone variants, thus, we hypothesized that cortisol also regulates deposition of histone H3 variants into chromatin. The CAF-1 complex deposits the canonical H3 variants (H3.1\/H3.2) onto DNA in a cell-cycle-dependent manner while other histone chaperones, HIRA at genic and DAXX at telomeric regions, deposit the H3.3 variant independently of cell cycle. In accordance with the decline in canonical histone levels, treatment with cortisol suppressed the expression of the CAF-1 complex. Reduced canonical histone abundance is known to trigger &#8220;gap filling&#8221; of naked DNA with the H3.3 variant to maintain integrity. In support of the idea that H3.3 becomes enriched in chromatin upon chronic exposure of lung cancer cells to cortisol, our results showed that the proportion of H3.3 increases upon cortisol exposure, and concomitantly H3.3 chaperone HIRA is induced upon treatment with cortisol. These data support a model in which chronic exposure to glucocorticoids, as it occurs with aging or through treatment with synthetic glucocorticoids (e.g. dexamethasone), regulates nucleosome abundance and composition in lung cancer cells through dynamic regulation of histone H3 chaperone systems. Together, we propose that this glucocorticoid-induced nucleosome remodeling establishes a chromatin environment that enables the transition to a mesenchymal-like senescent state in lung cancer cells that favors aggressiveness and poor prognosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-01 Chromatin structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glucocorticoid,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Histone modification,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Benito  M.

The biological significance of G4 has been attributed to the regulation of gene expression, and more recently, to the stabilization and generation of enhancer-promotor interaction. Since G4 are enriched in the promoter region of the proto-oncogene MYC, we sought to investigate the role of G4 in stabilizing the enhancer-promoter loop using the locus 8q24 (hg38) 127,700,000-128,500,000 that contains the MYC gene as a model.<br \/>Methods: Two different cell lines were used, the spontaneously immortalized, non-oncogenic human epidermal keratinocyte (HaCaT), in which the enrichment of G4 in the MYC promoter was demonstrated, and the primary normal human epidermal keratinocyte (nHEK) that is depleted of G4 in MYC promoter. Both cell lines were exposed to the G4 selective stabilizer 360-A drug and the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) could be calculated.

Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C-qPCR) technique was performed interrogating the MYC gene (chr8:127,733,798-127,744,729) and the putative enhancer in the lncRNA PVT1 gene (chr8:127,914,509-127,922,393) to compare the frequency of promoter-enhancer interaction between the two cell lines.<br \/>Results: The HaCaT cells showed interaction between the MYC promoter and the distal region. The nHEK cells that are not enriched for G4 showed no promoter interaction with the distal region. The use of 360-A in IC50 did not change the results. The gene expression analysis of the MYC showed higher expression in HaCaT cells compared to nHEK. There was no difference in DNA methylation in the MYC promoter between the two cell lines.<br \/>Conclusions: The data suggest an important role of G4 for the interaction of the MYC promoter and downstream enhancer. Additional analyzes of other genomic regions enriched for G4 should be performed to confirm the mechanism.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-01 Chromatin structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"G-quadruplex,Myc,Promoter analysis,Chromatin remodeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dieila Giomo De Lima<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Gustavo Narvaes Guimarães<sup><\/sup>, Bianca Caroline Figueiredo Bianco<sup><\/sup>, Ana Paula De Souza<sup><\/sup>, Aline Cristiane Planello<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Histology and Embriology, State University of Campinas, Piracicaba, Brazil","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f2fbd8f4-7c4e-4fc7-a97f-9310b61bee4d","ControlNumber":"7662","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

However, the effectiveness of BTKi is limited by the development of adaptive drug resistance. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify critical biologic features that determine BTKi efficacy in order to develop more effective therapies. Epigenetic aberrations play an important role in tumor initiation, progression, and drug resistance. However, it is currently unknown if BCR signaling is also dependent on epigenetic mechanisms to support oncogenic gene expression and survival in CLL B cells.<br \/>Methods and Results: To gain new insights into the role of epigenetic regulation of BTKi treatment in CLL B cells, we analyzed the genome wide chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and histone modification (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3) profiles (CUT&#38;Tag) of leukemic cells from 4 CLL patients on ibrutinib treatment in a sequential fashion (i.e., baseline, on ibrutinib treatment, and at relapse). We also performed the same analysis in other cohorts at two stages of ibrutinib treatment (baseline and while on treatment, n=20). Our studies show that suppressing BCR signaling by BTKi treatment leads to an alteration of a pro-survival epigenetic signature (defined by histone modifications and chromatin accessibility landscapes) in CLL and that the genes regulated by these chromatin changes are enriched in pathways associated with malignant B cell survival (i.e., BCR signaling and apoptosis pathways). Importantly, disruption of this pro-survival epigenetic signature is necessary for effective BTKi treatment. We further find that the transcription factor (TF) Nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) couples the BCR signaling to control this pro-survival epigenetic program that supports CLL B cell survival. In specific, we show that nuclear depletion of NFATc1 is required for BTKi induced epigenetic alteration and effective BTKi treatment. Depletion of NFATc1 disrupts the pro-survival epigenetic signature and inhibits CLL B cells survival, which improves the efficacy of BTKi treatment in CLL.<br \/>Conclusion: Here using leukemic cells from CLL patients with BTKi treatment, we demonstrate that epigenetic regulators are exploited by the oncogenic signaling pathway to support malignant cell survival. Specifically, NFATc1 is utilized by the BCR signaling pathway to control an epigenetic signature that supports CLL cell survival. This BCR regulated epigenetic machinery can be targeted to maintain and enhance BTKi treatment efficacy in CLL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-01 Chromatin structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,Chromatin,BTK,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zhiquan Wang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Huihuang Yan<sup>1<\/sup>, Justin  C.

Dysregulation of chromatin remodelers is estimated to affect 10-20% of cancer. Thus, understanding how epigenetic-based mechanisms contribute to cancer initiation and progression is critical. KMT5C is a histone methyltransferase that catalyzes histone H4 lysine 20 trimethylation (H4K20me3), which has historically been associated with formation and maintenance of constitutive heterochromatin regions. Albeit recent evidence from our lab also suggests regulation of gene-rich euchromatin regions. In this previous body of work we discovered that loss of KMT5C promotes development of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells (PC9 and HCC827). Patient data further supports that the KMT5C transcript level is downregulated following resistance to osimertinib, a third-generation TKI. Our data suggests that KMT5C is involved in non-canonical regulation of genes outside of heterochromatic regions through its methyltransferase activity. Analysis of data deposited into the Cell Miner database and publicly available RNA-sequencing and ChIP-sequencing data revealed that the KMT5C-H4K20me3 axis has significant negative correlations with several genes involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Our validation studies support this observation. However the mechanisms involved in KMT5C facilitating this change at EMT-related genes is unknown. KMT5C is well understood to be recruited to heterochromatin regions through its interaction with HP1, yet the mechanism for recruitment of KMT5C to gene-rich euchromatin regions remains to be elucidated. We hypothesize that KMT5C is recruited to its target genes in euchromatin in an HP1-independent mechanism. In this study, we aim to identify the interactome of KMT5C using an unbiased proximity labeling BioID approach. This study is expected to uncover a novel epigenetic mechanism that contributes to development of resistance to TKIs and may inform of strategies to target KMT5C-downregulated TKI-resistant cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-06 Histone modification,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Histone methylation,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jihye Son<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Alejandra Agredo<sup><\/sup>, Ally Glaws<sup><\/sup>, Andrea  L.

Both RAS and PP2A mediate their effects by phosphoregulation, but phosphoprotein targets in which RAS and PP2A activities converge in human cancers have not been systematically analyzed. Here, based on mass spectrometry phosphoproteome data, we discover that phosphosites co-regulated by RAS and PP2A are enriched on proteins involved in epigenetic gene regulation. As examples, RAS and PP2A co-regulate the same phosphorylation sites on HDAC1\/2, KDM1A, MTA1\/2, RNF168 and TP53BP1. Mechanistically, we validate co-regulation of NuRD chromatin repressor complex by RAS and PP2A. Consistent with their known synergistic effects in cancer, RAS activation and PP2A inhibition resulted in epigenetic reporter de-repression and activation of oncogenic transcription. Notably, transcriptional de-repression by PP2A inhibition was associated with increased euchromatin and decrease in global DNA methylation. In RAS-driven cancers, PP2A activity is inhibited by nuclear PP2A inhibitor proteins PME-1 and SET. We further demonstrate that these PP2A inhibitors drive oncogenic transcription, but that their transcriptional targets are highly diversified. Whereas PME-1 controls RAS and MYC-driven transcription, SET controls TP53 targets and G2\/M checkpoint genes. We further provide evidence that these nuclear PP2A inhibitors significantly differ in their roles in regulating DNA methylation. Collectively the results indicate that epigenetic protein complexes involved in oncogenic gene expression constitute a significant point of convergence for RAS hyperactivity and PP2A inhibition in cancer. Further, the results provide a rich source for future understanding of phosphorylation as a previously unappreciated layer of regulation of epigenetic gene regulation in cancer, and in other RAS\/PP2A-regulated cellular processes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-04 Epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methylation,Histone deacetylase,Ras,Protein phosphatase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Mukund Sharma<sup>1<\/sup>, Anna Aakula<sup>1<\/sup>, Francesco Tabaro<sup>2<\/sup>, Henrik Honkanen<sup>1<\/sup>, Jesse Kamila<sup>1<\/sup>, Matthieu Schapira<sup>3<\/sup>, Cheryl Arrowsmith<sup>3<\/sup>, Matti Nykter<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Jukka K.

Aberrant nucleosome organization from dysregulated chromatin remodeling can severely alter chromatin accessibility and disrupt these important processes, thereby driving various cancers. Remarkably, nearly 20% of all human cancers contain mutations in subunits from the SWI\/SNF family of chromatin remodeling complexes, making them of great interest to basic research and therapeutic intervention. <i>In vitro<\/i> studies on the remodeling enzymes (and their multi-subunit complexes) are challenging, partially due to the strong preference for nucleosome-based substrates (the physiological target of these enzymes). We have created the EpiDyne<sup>&#174;<\/sup> nucleosome portfolio to examine chromatin remodeler activity in biochemical assays, and here present the development of novel readouts (-PicoGreen<sup>TM<\/sup> and -TR-FRET). These nonradioactive plate-based assays are automation adaptable, ready for high-throughput inhibitor screening, and can be customized for various remodeling enzymes that exhibit preferences in nucleosome composition (<i>e.g.<\/i> histone type or DNA linker length).For parallel <i>in vivo<\/i> studies we note that genome-wide remodeler localization and open chromatin mapping are fundamental for understanding the function \/ activity of these enzymes in cancer development and inhibitor response. However, traditional genomic approaches have significant issues: <i>e.g.<\/i> <i>ChIP-seq<\/i> is unable to effectively map ATPases without heavily modified high-noise protocols; while <i>ATAC-seq<\/i> to map open regions cannot deal with cross-linking that could stabilize transient states on interest.

Subsequent work suggests that LSD1 may trigger gene activation via demethylating H3K9me1\/2 in the context of steroid receptors. Our previous studies have confirmed that LSD1 functions broadly as a coactivator of androgen receptor (AR)-regulated enhancers but retains its H3K4 demethylation function at these sites. Importantly, our recent work revealed that LSD1 regulates the accessibility of active enhancers through the interaction with FOXA1, which functions as a pioneer transcription factor by facilitating AR access to chromatin.&nbsp;LSD1 inhibition disrupts the global binding of FOXA1 by blocking the demethylation of K270 of FOXA1, leading to inhibition of AR binding and transcriptional activity. However, in addition to AR signaling, it remains largely unknown whether LSD1 regulates other critical oncogenic programs during prostate cancer (PCa) progression. In this study, we aimed to fully understand the functional targets of LSD1 in castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) models.<br \/>We performed<b> <\/b>a large transcriptomic profiling of CRPC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models that are sensitive to LSD1 inhibitors. Our analyses indicated that LSD1 inhibition targeted multiples oncogenic programs, including previously known pathways such as AR, FOXA1, and E2F, and a previously undefined pathway, MYC signaling. Through single-cell RNA-seq analysis in a CRPC PDX model, we confirmed that MYC signaling was decreased in the responsive tumor cells and identified a previously unknown molecular subtype, <i>AR<\/i><sup>+<\/sup>\/<i>FOXA1<\/i><sup>+<\/sup>\/<i>LSD1<\/i><sup>low<\/sup>\/<i>RB1<\/i><sup>-<\/sup>, which was resistant to LSD1 inhibition. It is well known that <i>MYC<\/i> is driven by super-enhancers (SEs), which are regulated by BRD4 (bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) protein). We further evaluated LSD1, FOXA1 and BRD4 ChIP-seq and defined SEs by using H3K27ac ChIP-seq followed by ROSE analysis. We found that LSD1, FOXA1, and BRD4 co-occupied at MYC SEs and BRD4 was recruited by unmethylated FOXA1 but not K270-methylated FOXA1. In addition, we observed the puncta-like formation of LSD1\/BRD4 marked nuclear condensates under confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. By examining the public datasets of H3K27ac ChIP-seq of samples with different stages of PCa development, we identified a subset of SEs which were distinctly activated in CRPC. Using multiple CRPC PDXs, we revealed that combining LSD1 inhibitors with BET inhibitors exhibited strong synergy possibly via disrupting the CRPC-specific SEs.<br \/>In summary, this study reveals a novel oncogenic function of LSD1 in driving PCa progression by activating SE-driven oncogenic programs, such as MYC signaling. These results provide a strong therapeutic potential of combining inhibitors of LSD1 and BRD4 in treating CRPC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-01 Chromatin structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRD4,LSD1,MYC,super-enhancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mingyu Liu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Muqing Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Dong Han<sup>1<\/sup>, Zifeng Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Wanting Han<sup>2<\/sup>, Housheng Hansen He<sup>3<\/sup>, Shuai Gao<sup>4<\/sup>, Changmeng Cai<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Massachusetts - Boston, Boston, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, WA,<sup>3<\/sup>University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada,<sup>4<\/sup>New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5f1365af-7132-4d64-83d5-c3b55b2380c9","ControlNumber":"2742","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

However, they play an important role in the emergence of AR-independent phenotypes, including treatment-induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer (tNEPC). Few genetic differences are observed between CRPC and tNEPC, suggesting an epigenetic dysregulation underlining this conversion.<br \/>Method: To capture the evolution of CRPC to tNEPC, we measured changes in chromatin accessibility of CRPC cells upon exposure to ENZ and in tNEPC cell lines via ATACseq. We performed RNAseq from matched cell lines. We conducted ASCL1, H3K27me3 and EZH2 ChIPseq. Multi-omic analysis were performed integrating RNAseq, ATACseq, ChIPseq, RNA and protein expression.<br \/>Result: We identified the motif of the transcription factor ASCL1 becoming accessible as early as 3 days, with continued enrichment at 10 days post ENZ-treatment and in NEPC cell-lines. ASCL1 expression and activity are significantly upregulated in NEPC cell lines and patient tumors. Using our unique model of tNEPC, we showed that knockdown of ASCL1 causes extensive chromatin reorganization leading to reduced expression of neuronal and plasticity markers and overall abolishment of the NEPC program. Loss of ASCL1 dysregulated Polycomb repressor complex 2 activity (loss of H3K27 methylation) via di-association of complex due to phosphorylation of EZH2 at T311 resulting in loss of EZH2 binding to the chromatin and likely cause of the H3K27 demethylation. Cell fractionation and confocal microscopy combined with ChIPseq data confirmed loss of EZH2 binding to the chromatin. We identified that loss of ASCL1, phenocopying EZH2 inhibition, reactivated luminal programming and potentially re-sensitizing tNEPC cells to further AR targeted therapies. Altogether, suggests that ASCL1 may drive early transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming through the PRC2, facilitating the emergence and maintenance of tNEPC.<br \/>Conclusion: Our research provides the centrality of epigenetic reprogramming in driving the uprising of a plastic phenotype in response to AR pathway inhibition and provides insight into the role of ASCL1 in early drug-induced epigenomic plasticity that supports this reprogramming toward androgen independence. We report that ASCL1 modulates the chromatin dynamics to support a plastic lineage by influencing neuronal stem cell-like regulatory networks. In the treatment-resistant, high plasticity state, inhibition of ASCL1 reverses the lineage to an epithelial-luminal state, providing potential for targeting these highly aggressive tumors. This work provides much-needed insight into ASCL1 function and dependency that together nominates ASCL1 as a bona fide clinical target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-04 Epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Therapy resistance,Epigenetics,Tumor biology,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shaghayegh Nouruzi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Dwaipayan Ganguli<sup>1<\/sup>, Nakisa Tabrizian<sup>2<\/sup>, Maxim Kobelev<sup>2<\/sup>, Olena Sivak<sup>1<\/sup>, Takeshi Namekawa<sup>1<\/sup>, Alastair Davies<sup>1<\/sup>, Amina Zoubeidi<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Vancouver Prostate Center, Vancouver, BC, Canada,<sup>2<\/sup>Experimental Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1cb35ca7-f64d-4795-9546-cbf406e7d5a7","ControlNumber":"3933","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

This is due to major problems with sample availability, and processing which is laborious, costly, slow, inconsistent, and leads to sample loss. Epigenetics studies need samples with certain minimum concentrations and volumes to address all necessary questions. The samples often need to be in single cell or nuclear suspensions. For chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), a consistent size of approximately 300 base pairs of DNA is essential but difficult to achieve. To address the above problems, we present novel cutting-edge epigenetics methodologies. Homogenization of various tissue types from diverse patients with different disease states is the first crucial step in sample processing. Hence, we present new protocols which are compatible with high-throughput cavitation-based pixelated ultrasound sonication. It processes limited quantities of samples in a 96-well plate where cells can be grown and antibody can be coated for ChIP. Further, 1 to 12 columns of the 96-well plate can be flexibly regulated to extract lysates. Our results show how this rapid and simple technology integrates with ChIP-sequencing (seq) and RNA-seq workflows, yielding very consistent output from limited tissue samples. Bioinformatics analysis of the ChIP-seq shows the corresponding biological significance. Certain limitations of ChIP has led to the evolution of other methods but they are mostly unsuccessful in mapping transcription factors. Hence, we next present a modified ChIP-seq combined with tagmentation, indexing and pooling, coupled to pixelated ultrasound based-cavitation. Here, individual samples are placed in each well of a 96-well plate containing unique indexing adapters fused to Tn5 transposase. Hence, each sample undergoes tagmentation - a process where DNA gets fragmented and simultaneously inserted with index adapters. Next, pixelated ultrasound helps to rapidly extract the complex of protein-tagmented DNA from 96 samples which are pooled into a single tube because they are uniquely indexed, then split up for immunoprecipitation by different antibodies. Bioinformatics analysis shows that the results are robust, consistent, and match ENCODE datasets. Hence, our methods can help to process high-throughput samples for AACR Project GENIE. Overall, we present novel technology to process limited human samples for enabling epigenetics research at the clinical interface from bench to bedside. The simple and less expensive methods yield high quality samples to enable high-throughput analysis of epigenetics including transcription factors which are important in cancer. They help us to understand targeted epigenetic regulations of genes for therapeutic developments and treating cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-04 Epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Chromatin immunoprecipitation,Bioinformatics,High-throughput assay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Rwik Sen<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Ngoc Tran<sup><\/sup>, Sarah Traynor<sup><\/sup>, Eric Maina<sup><\/sup>, Jason Poole<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"71f9653b-b047-49bd-840e-cf0e2420fe0a","ControlNumber":"3102","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.

Its higher tumor recurrence and progression rates cause major treatment challenges. One of the most frequent mutations in bladder cancer is in lysine-specific demethylase 6A (KDM6A). This gene encodes for ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat on chromosome X (UTX), which catalyzes the demethylation of di- and tri- methylated histones H3 lysine 27 and works as part of &#8220;COMPASS-LIKE&#8221; protein complexes to coordinate many transcriptional processes. The molecular basis for how KDM6A mutations promote carcinogenesis is still under investigation. In this study, we use single-cell RNA sequencing data from bladder cancers with and without KDM6A mutations in both human and mice to examine the effects of KDM6A mutations on the cellular composition and gene expression of tumor and normal bladders. In mice without tumors, KDM6A mutations seem to correlate with enrichment of macrophages in the bladder tissue microenvironment. The opposite is true, however, in the presence of tumors, as there were not only more macrophages but also more dendritic cells in wildtype mice. This pattern was also observed in human, suggesting differences in immune infiltrates in the tumor microenvironment are part of the phenotype of KDM6A mutation. Lastly, KDM6A mutations may also impact urothelial cell states at baseline, as KDM6A KO mouse bladders contain higher proportions of intermediate cell populations compared with their wildtype counterparts. Together, these observations contribute to a better understanding of the role KDM6A plays in bladder cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Knockout mice,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ninh  B.

The median survival of GBM patients is only about one year and about 95% patients succumb after five years. This gloomy picture has not been improved for decades, even with extensive treatments including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Hence, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying GBM development may provide new therapeutic opportunities. Primary GBM generally harbors a low mutational load when compared to other human cancers. Even P53&#8212;the guardian of the genome that is essentially disabled in nearly all human cancers, remains unmutated in about 71% of GBM cases. Moreover, these P53 wildtype GBM cases are as aggressive as those with P53 mutations. To explore the mechanism by which P53 wildtype GBM thrive in the presence of intact P53, we performed CRISPR screens in a panel of human cancer cell lines using an sgRNA library specifically targeting the functional domains of ~200 chromatin regulators. We discovered that BRD8&#8217;s bromodomain&#8212;a druggable domain as shown by the tremendous success in preclinical and clinical trial in diverse cancers&#8212;is a vulnerability specifically in P53 wildtype GBM cases. Our mechanistic studies demonstrate that BRD8 functions through the EP400 chromatin remodeling complex and hijacks the histone variant H2AZ at P53 target loci, enforcing a compact chromatin state that blocks P53&#8217;s accessibility to its targets. We show that targeting the BRD8 bromodomain releases H2AZ, opens up chromatin, engages P53-mediated transactivation, and triggers growth arrest. Consistent with these findings, BRD8 is highly expressed with H2AZ in patient-derived proliferating GBM cells, and is inversely correlated with the expression of P53 targets. Our work solves a long-standing mystery in P53 wildtype GBM, and presents a promising therapeutic target for the majority of GBM patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-04 Large-scale approaches to cancer gene discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bromodomain,p53,EP400,H2AZ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sherine Xueqin Sun<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Olaf Klingbeil<sup><\/sup>, Christopher Vakoc<sup><\/sup>, Alea Mills<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d24c7510-753d-45cf-b8c7-13eed356a5a5","ControlNumber":"6737","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.
