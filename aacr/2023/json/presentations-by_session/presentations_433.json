[{"Abstract":"Tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) is an ectopic lymphoid organ found in some tumors. The presence of TLS is recently proposed as a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in mutation-driven tumors. It is also associated with prognosis in copy number-driven tumors, including high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), although the function of TLS and its interaction with copy-number alterations in HGSOC is not fully understood. In the current study, we comprehensively analyze immune profile, copy number profile and quantitative imaging profile from 242 HGSOC patients (HH cohort), and combine these with two public single cell RNA-sequencing datasets (Lambrechts cohorts; n=9, 29,999 cells). TLS-high HGSOC patients show significantly better progression free survival in both HH and TCGA cohorts. We show that presence of TLS in HGSOC tumors is associated with B-cell maturation, resulting in higher and more specific immunoglobulin production; TLS also leads to more cytotoxic tumor-specific T-cells activation and proliferation. Through integrated analysis of single cell RNA-sequencing and whole exome sequencing data, we reveal that the copy number loss of <i>IL15<\/i> and <i>CXCL10<\/i> may limit TLS formation in HGSOC; we also propose a list of genes that may dysregulate TLS function. A candidate gene, <i>DCAF15<\/i>, is found to confer resistance to NK-mediated cytotoxicity in HGSOC cell lines. Lastly, we develop a radiomics-based signature to predict presence of TLS, which independently predicts PFS in both HGSOC patients and ICI-treated NSCLC patients. Overall, we reveal that TLS coordinates intratumoral B-cell and T-cell response against HGSOC tumor, while cancer genome evolves to counteract TLS formation and function.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Tertiary lymphoid structure,Copy number alterations,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Haonan Lu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Georg Wengert<sup>1<\/sup>, Hantao Lou<sup>2<\/sup>, Reema Paudel<sup>1<\/sup>, Naina Patel<sup>1<\/sup>, Saral Desai<sup>1<\/sup>, Bill Crum<sup>1<\/sup>, Kristofer Linton-Reid<sup>1<\/sup>, Mitchell Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Dongyang Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Jacey Ip<sup>1<\/sup>, Francesco Mauri<sup>1<\/sup>, David  J.

Only 8.5% of the patients live beyond 5 years after their initial diagnosis. This dismal survival rate is partly explained by the fact that most pancreatic cancer cases are detected late when treatment options are limited. Novel biomarkers are crucially needed. It has long been recognized that cancer cells abnormally accumulate chemical groups covalently linked to proteins, DNA and other molecules. Humoral responses to these &#8220;adducts&#8221; have not been thoroughly explored. To investigate these responses, we developed an ELISA platform for the detection of serum IgG reactive to 93 adducts, including post-translational modifications known to contribute to tumorigenesis, progression, and metastasis. Our panel also includes oxidation-related modification, advanced glycation end products, and certain co-enzymes that qualify as adducts based on their binding properties. Using this assay, we measured anti-adduct antibodies in the serum of adult healthy donors (N=24; age range 40-80) as well as patients with pancreatic cancer (N=31; age range 50-90). Importantly, all patient specimens were collected before any treatment. Reactivity to all adducts was analyzed using a random forest predictive model with 10,000 bootstrapped decision trees to distinguish between the two groups. Results revealed a distinctive anti-adduct IgG reactivity profile for pancreatic cancer patients when compared to controls. Applying feature selection using the Boruta algorithm identified a reduced set of 19 target adducts recognized by IgG that most efficiently discriminated between healthy donors and pancreatic cancer cases. All 19 adducts were confirmed as IgG targets in cancer patients using multiple unpaired t-tests (p&#8804;0,05). Aside from their predictive value, we reasoned that the detection of adduct-specific antibodies in cancer patients reflected their accumulation in the tumor cells. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the level of two representative target adducts by immunofluorescence staining in tumor tissue compared to control adjacent non-tumoral tissue or healthy tonsil. Results unequivocally show higher levels of these two adducts in cancer cells compared to non-cancer cells. Taken together, these preliminary findings support our hypothesis of the development of anti-adduct antibodies in pancreatic cancer patients. Furthermore, the specific antibody signature detected in these patients is consistent with the abnormal presence of corresponding adducts in the transformed cells. Our findings pave the way for the development of diagnostic tests based on the detection of serum IgG specific to tumor-associated adducts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Antibody responses,Adducts,ELISA screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Talita Aguiar<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Shunya Mashiko<sup>1<\/sup>, Poulomi Roy<sup>1<\/sup>, Max Dietzel<sup>1<\/sup>, Kesava Asam<sup>2<\/sup>, Bradley Aouizerat<sup>2<\/sup>, Jeanine Genkinger<sup>3<\/sup>, Helen Remotti<sup>4<\/sup>, Emmanuel Zorn<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY,<sup>2<\/sup>NYU Dental Translational Research Center, New York University, New York, NY,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Epidemiology, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, NY,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7fdfdb40-87e7-487b-8e98-4ca9353b5c48","ControlNumber":"2026","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

T lymphocytes represent the largest lymphocyte population within the tumor, and numerous immunotherapies have been developed to specifically target this cellular subset. B cells are the next most abundant lymphocyte subset within the tumor microenvironment, and recent studies have identified crucial roles for intratumoral B cells in the production of tumor-reactive antibodies. Using human dissociated tumor cells (DTCs) samples, we have profiled intratumoral B cells to determine their frequency and subset breakdown across thirteen different solid tumor indications. Intratumoral B cells were prevalent in lung cancer and cancers of the gastrointestinal tract (esophageal, gastric, and colorectal), while they were rarer in cancers of the female reproductive tract (endometrial and ovarian). The transcriptional profile and B cell repertoire of the intratumoral B cell subsets were evaluated to provide a deeper understanding of the biology of these tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte subsets. Additionally, spatial transcriptomics were utilized to understand the spatiotemporal location of these subsets within the tumor microenvironment. These studies will provide critical insight for the development of the next generation of immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,B cells,Single cell,Transcription,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shawn P.

However, the mechanisms that govern generation of TCF1<sup>high<\/sup> cells are poorly understood.<br \/>Methods: We sequenced bulk RNA from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to identify differentially expressed genes based on tumor progression. We utilized <i>in vitro<\/i> co-cultures of tumor-specific T cells tumor cells to examine differentiation, effector function, and metabolism of T cells with different genetic and pharmacologic manipulations by flow cytometry, metabolic flux analyses, and metabolomic profiling. We performed <i>in vivo<\/i> adoptive transfers of control and manipulated tumor-specific T cells into tumor-bearing mice from both a non-small cell lung cancer and a melanoma model to examine effects of genetic manipulation on differentiation and effector function, as well as determine tumor burden and overall mouse survival both in the treatment-na&#239;ve and anti-PD-1 treated contexts.<br \/>Results: RNA Sequencing demonstrated a metabolically active response in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells isolated from large and late-stage tumors.

Antigen-specific PKM2<sup>KO<\/sup> CD8+ T cells from draining lymph nodes and tumors exhibited a central memory-like phenotype with reduced effector cytokine production, increased CD44\/CD62L expression, and increased TCF1 and Eomes in non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma.

For example, the therapeutic intervention of T cell-tumor cell interactions of PD-1 and PD-L1, respectively, by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has improved the clinical outcome of cancer patients. However, only a minority of patients are currently benefiting from ICB. Thus, there is an urgent need to improve our understanding of the T cell-tumor cell interplay. Recently developed algorithms serve to deconvolute gene expression of physically interacting cells (PIC). However, such approaches are limited for proteomics (MS) and phosphoproteomics (pMS), which are required to get molecular insight into protein functionality. Here, we present a new method: <u>Hy<\/u>brid quantification of <u>S<\/u>ILAC-barcoded <u>i<\/u>nteracting <u>c<\/u>ells (HySic). Briefly, we use Stable Isotope Labelling by Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC) to differentiate between two cell types of interest: T cells and tumor cells. We co-cultured the cells allowing to engage in functional interactions and without the need to separate them, and subsequently performed a label-free quantification (LFQ) LC-MS analysis. After initial bioinformatic analysis and validation with independent techniques, we used HySic to unravel protein mechanisms contributing to functional T cell-tumor cell interactions. We used established interaction mechanisms like those mediated by IFN<i>&#947;<\/i> signaling proteins to benchmark HySic, while this analysis also brought new protein pathways to light, which will be presented. In conclusion, we have established and validated HySIC as a new method to study protein signaling dynamics in physically interacting cells. Our data shows the effectiveness and applicability of HySIC to study cell-cell interactions, which could be easily extended to other biological systems.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteomics,Immuno-oncology,T cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sofía Ibáñez Molero<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Alisha Atmopawiro<sup>1<\/sup>, Alex M.

However, although augmentation of CD28 signaling is well known to be essential for restoring dysfunctional T cell immune responses upon immune checkpoint blockade treatment, it is unclear how CD28 in tumor-infiltrated T cells is activated in the absence of corresponding ligands on cancer.

However, the fate of these clonal populations that have migrated into the tumor environment - whether they persist, contract, and\/or produce memory cells - is unknown. An improved understanding of clonal durability and potency will be essential for the development of novel cancer immunotherapies.<br \/>Here, we applied our previously developed bilateral tumor mouse model to track the fate of endogenous T cell clones responding to tumors in the same individual. This approach relied on the fact that the clonal composition of the two tumors is identical, allowing the sampling and comparison of tumor-infiltrating cells from the same clonal populations on different days in the same individual. Mice were inoculated bilaterally with Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC), and tumors were resected, one after the other, on days 14 and 21 post-inoculation. At each timepoint, sampled CD8+ T cells were gated on PD1, Ly108, and TIM-3 expression and subjected to T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to identify clones. We utilized this data to quantify changes in the fraction of memory-like (Ly108+TIM-3-) and exhausted (Ly108-TIM-3+, Ly108+TIM-3+) cells of individual clonal populations over time.<br \/>The majority (75%) of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells on day 14 belonged to clonal populations that persisted on day 21. These clonal populations were classed as &#8216;expanding&#8217; or &#8216;contracting&#8217; based on changes in their clone size. Despite the polyclonal response to the tumor, almost all expanding clones contained a high fraction of memory-like (Ly108+TIM-3-) cells, whereas almost all &#8216;contracting&#8217; clones contained a high fraction of exhausted (TIM-3+) cells. These characteristics were sufficient to predict whether a clonal population at day 14 would later expand or contract. We further quantified how the makeup of &#8216;contracting&#8217; clonal populations changed over time. While all &#8216;contracting&#8217; clonal populations lost a considerable number of exhausted (TIM3+) cells, half of the clonal populations maintained a pool of memory-like (Ly108+TIM-3-) cells in the tumor.<br \/>These results demonstrate that clonal dynamics can be predicted from static measurements, facilitating the development of novel methods to infer patient immune activity. The results also demonstrate the possibility of altering clonal fate. Reinvigoration of the pool of memory-like cells maintained in the tumor could re-expand contracting clonal populations, and thereby enhance the immune response against the tumor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Cytotoxic T cells,Clonal dynamics,Clonal fate,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Munetomo Takahashi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mikiya Tsunoda<sup>2<\/sup>, Hiroyasu Aoki<sup>2<\/sup>, Haru Ogiwara<sup>2<\/sup>, Shigeyuki Shichino<sup>2<\/sup>, Kouji Matsushima<sup>2<\/sup>, Satoshi Ueha<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Graduate School and Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e832e098-f2dc-42c6-9d13-4f02789394dc","ControlNumber":"3220","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

The interaction of T cell receptors (TCRs) on T cells with Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)-peptide complexes on cancer cells elicits the cytotoxic activity of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Here we set out to understand how the strength of this interaction, or T cell avidity, shapes the phenotype of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> TILs and how that dictates anti-tumor immunity. We developed a novel tetramer decay assay to isolate T cells based on their TCR avidities. We then used this method to isolate from tumors of Meth A tumor-bearing mice (28 days after tumor challenge), Low (K off &#60; 15 min), Medium (75 min &#62; K off &#62; 45 min), and High (K off &#62; 105 min) avidity CD8<sup>+<\/sup> TILs responding to the tumor rejection neoepitope, PDPR<sup>MUT<\/sup> of this fibrosarcoma (Ebrahimi-Nik et al. JCI Insight 2019). Unbiased clustering of single cell RNA sequencing, TCR sequencing, and CITE-seq of these PDPR<sup>MUT<\/sup> -specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> TILs revealed five clusters: Stem-Like (LY108<sup>+<\/sup><i>Tcf7<\/i><sup>+<\/sup>), Effector-Exhausted (Eff-Exh PD-1<sup>Low<\/sup>,CX3CR1<sup>+<\/sup>) Terminally-Exhausted-1 (Term-Exh1 PD-1<sup>+<\/sup>TIM3<sup>High<\/sup>), Terminally-Exhausted-2 (Term-Exh2 PD-1<sup>High<\/sup><i>Tox<\/i><sup>High<\/sup>), and NK-Like (PD-1<sup>Low<\/sup>, <i>Klr<\/i><sup>High<\/sup>). The low avidity CD8<sup>+<\/sup> TILs have more than twice the proportion of Eff-Exh (60.0%) when compared to high avidity CD8<sup>+<\/sup> TILs (28.39%). The high avidity CD8<sup>+<\/sup> TILs have more Stem-Like (12.37% vs 6.31%), Term-Exh1 (27.38% vs 21.88%), and Term-Exh2 (24.03% vs 5.33%) cells than low avidity CD8<sup>+<\/sup> TILs. Furthermore, trajectory inference of these clusters, by scVelo, predicts that Stem-Like cells differentiate into Eff-Exh cells that can differentiate into either Term-Exh1 or Term-Exh2. Our data demonstrates that low avidity Eff-Exh cells preferentially differentiate into Term-Exh1, while high avidity Eff-Exh cells differentiate into both Term-Exh1 and Term-Exh2. To validate these results, we isolated CD8<sup>+<\/sup> TILs responding to PDPR<sup>MUT<\/sup> with low or high avidity from tumors of 21 Meth A bearing mice 28 days after tumor challenge and analyzed their exhaustion phenotype by flow cytometry.

Radiotherapy (RT) is a bladder preserving option that offers patients comparable survival rates. However, up to 30% of patients require salvage cystectomy. Emerging evidence points to an important yet poorly understood link between response to RT and the tumor microenvironment (TME). Notably, tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are being investigated as a potential local hub for mounting an immune response. These lymph-node-like structures are highly organized with a B cell zone surrounded by T cells. Mature TLS also have an active germinal center (GC) with follicular dendritic cells. A number of studies correlated TLS with improved outcomes in several types of solid cancers. Here, we explore the use of TLS and its associated immune TME as a predictive biomarker for response to RT in MIBC. Methods: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&#38;E) stained formalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded sections of pre-RT biopsy from 147 MIBC patients were examined to identify TLS presence with confirmation from a pathologist. Subsequent multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) staining with CD21 and CD23 characterized TLS maturity. To investigate the interaction between TLS and TME, tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed, and gene expression profiles were obtained for 106 patients using NanoString&#8217;s Digital Spatial technology. Moreover, the TMAs were stained with CD20, Neutrophil Elastase, CD68, CD8, CD4, and FoxP3 by mIHC. Image analysis was performed on the Halo platform. TLS gene signature was correlated to the immune infiltration and the patient outcomes. Results: H&#38;E revealed that 19.7% of patients (n=68) had TLS with a GC, 17.0% (n=25) had TLS without a GC, and 12.9% (n=19) had no TLS. In the remaining 50.3% of cases (n=74), confirmation of TLS presence required staining with CD3 and CD20. Gene expression of TLS marker CXCL13 was higher among complete responders to RT (p-value=0.0440). This trend was weakened when we examined a previously described 12-chemokine TLS signature (p= 0.1506). When segregating patients into TLS high\/TLS low groups based on the gene signature, we observed significantly higher infiltration of CD8+ T cells (p&#60;0.0001), neutrophils (p=0.005), regulatory T cells (p=0.0278), and B cells (p=0.0247) among the TLS high group. No difference in macrophage infiltration was observed between the two groups.Conclusion: Our results point to a nuanced role of TLS in the context of response to RT and in relation to the TME. Further histological analysis of TLS characteristics is necessary to paint a picture of the different immune profiles we observe in our cohort and their association with the outcomes of RT. Overall, our study could identify an immune signature that could serve as a selection criterion for patients who would benefit the most from bladder-sparing therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Radiation therapy,Tertiary lymphoid structures,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nour Hassan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, José Joao Mansure<sup>1<\/sup>, Mina Farag<sup>2<\/sup>, Ronald Kool<sup>3<\/sup>, Eva Michaud<sup>1<\/sup>, Mohanned Alessa<sup>4<\/sup>, Luis Souhami<sup>5<\/sup>, Fabio Cury<sup>5<\/sup>, Fadi Brimo<sup>2<\/sup>, Wassim Kassouf<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Cancer Research Program, Research Institute of the McGill University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada,<sup>2<\/sup>Division of Pathology, McGill University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada,<sup>3<\/sup>Division or Urology, Department of Surgery, McGill University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada,<sup>4<\/sup>Division of Urology, Department of Surgery, McGill University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Radiation Oncology, McGill University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cb80bee0-450d-48fe-a7d9-14accfd202d1","ControlNumber":"6313","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

Such immunogenic antigens can be effective targets for neoantigen-based cancer vaccines. However, the identification of immunogenic neoantigens remains limited with the current prediction models. Here we designed mouse experiments to model tumor evolution under immune pressure and its association with T-cell clones to identify these antigens agnostically and improve current prediction models. We injected three lung cancer cell lines (KPA, KPC, and HKP1) in wildtype immune-competent C57BL\/6 mice and immune-deficient Rag1 defective (Rag1 KO) mice, respectively. The three tumor cell lines have common driver mutations, Kras G12D\/+ and p53 flox\/flox. Two weeks post tumor implantation, whole exome sequencing and RNA-seq was performed on tumor samples. We also performed T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to profile tumor infiltrated TCR clones. Despite the shared driver mutations, tumor growth patterns in vivo over time are very distinct for each cell line. Interestingly, KPA tumors show differential evolutionary patterns in wild type mice versus Rag1 KO mice, regressing in the former but rapidly progressing in the latter, suggesting that the difference can be attributed to immunoediting of KPA specific neoantigens. HKP1 tumors do not show substantial differences in that aggressive tumor progression is observed in both types of mice. Using WES data, we estimated the cancer cell fraction of each mutation based on phylogeny re-construction. We found that evolved KPA tumors (immunogenic) had significantly lower mutation burden in wild type mice compared to Rag1 KO mice (3410 vs 4199 on average), and the fraction of cell line mutations edited in vivo is significantly higher in wild type than in Rag1 KO (26% vs 14% on average), suggesting again the active on-going immunosurveillance in immune competent mice. In contrast, HKP1 tumors (non-immunogenic) do not show significant differences in mutation burden nor fraction of mutations edited between wild type and Rag1 KO mice. Furthermore, TCR-seq data show that the clonal expansion of T-cells is strongly associated with tumor immunogenicity. KPA tumor samples show significantly higher TCR clustering but with less diversity, quantified by modified Simpson&#8217;s Index, that is strongly correlated with the suppression of mutational burden (r=0.74). In summary, we found that tumor evolution in immune competent mice is dependent on mutational context of the tumor. By analyzing longitudinal tumor and TCR sequencing data, we showed that the immunogenicity of tumors is associated with significant decrease in mutational burden and higher T-cell clustering that is indicative of tumor mutation and TCR clone expansion co-evolution in immune competent mice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune response,Neoantigens,T cell,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jayon Lihm<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hyejin Choi<sup>2<\/sup>, Mariam  M.

Male and female immune systems demonstrate distinct differences that drive characterized disparities in response to viral infection and immunization. While several recent publications have shown that anti-tumor immune responses are inhibited by male sex hormone signaling, a critical gap in knowledge exists surrounding sex-based differences in the larger-scale process of immunoediting. Because the residual neoantigen burden expressed after tumor escape from immune surveillance is an important determinant of rejection following immune checkpoint blockade, disparities in immunoediting between males and females could have profound impacts on both cancer incidence and response to therapy. The purpose of our studies is to determine if the enhanced functionality of female T cells results in more effective immunoediting of tumors that evolve in females versus those that evolve in males. We have used the 3-methylcholanthrene carcinogen-induced tumor model and several transplant tumor models to determine if T cell function regulates differential cancer development between the sexes. We have also analyzed predicted neoantigen burden in male and female patients with melanoma and lung cancer to identify sex-based differences in tumor immunogenicity. We have found that female T cell responses are more effective at preventing tumor occurrence and delaying tumor outgrowth compared to male T cell responses in mice, which may help to explain established sex-based disparities in cancer incidence in the human population. In comparison, male patient tumors were more likely to express high neoantigen burden compared to their female counterparts. These results suggest that while stronger anti-tumor T cell responses in females are helpful in driving lower cancer incidence in females compared to males, this disparity may also result the development of tumors that express greater numbers of immunogenic neoantigens in males versus females. A better understanding of how sex impacts the entire process of immunoediting will help to explain cancer disparities between the sexes and identify potential new therapeutic strategies that can benefit all patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor immunity,T cell,Neoantigens,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Katey Hunt<sup><\/sup>, <b>Elise Alspach<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Saint Louis University, St. Louis, MO","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"aedbeae2-90c2-4a88-b4bd-6c1ab7a0c3d3","ControlNumber":"7633","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

Cancer Res. 2018;78(14):3954-3968). Here we compared their tumorigenicity and growth rates in immunocompetent C57BL\/6 mice and in immunodeficient Rag1-KO mice lacking B and T cells. Changes in the tumor and stromal compartments were correlated with the differences in growth rates observed. Observations and New Data:\u0009Tumors derived from all three BBN basal cell lines grew robustly in Rag1-KO mice (10\/10 BBN964 tumors, 19\/19 BBN966 tumors and 19\/19 BBN975 tumors &#62;100 mm3 by 10 weeks post-injection). Conversely, very few tumors grew in immunocompetent (C57BL\/6, e.g. B6) mice (0\/9 BBN964 at 8 weeks, 0\/17 BBN966 at 16 weeks, 4\/15 BBN975 at 9 weeks). BBN966 tumors conditioned to grow in Rag1-KO mice were also highly tumorigenic when they were subsequently transferred into immunocompetent mice (Rag1-KO &#61664; B6, 16\/20 mice with tumors &#62;100 mm3 at 4 weeks), and they displayed increased tumorigenicity when they were reintroduced into immunodeficient mice (Rag1-KO &#61664; Rag1-KO, 20\/20 mice with tumors &#62;100 mm3 at 3 weeks). BBN966 tumors harvested from B6 mice and passaged in vitro for 5 weeks maintained tumorigenicity when reimplanted into immunocompetent mice, and BBN966 tumors grown in female B6 mice grew robustly when transferred into male B6 mice. Bulk RNA sequencing of tumors comparing the BBN966 Rag1-KO (1st passage) to BBN966 Rag1-KO (2nd passage) demonstrated decreased expression of genes associated with tumor infiltrating macrophages in the 2nd passage tumors. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that basal BBN syngeneic bladder tumors display markedly different growth rates in wild-type and T- and B-cell-deficient mice. The results suggest that adaptive immunity controls basal bladder cancer tumorigenicity, which is consistent with the immune infiltrated landscape observed in basal human bladder cancers. Further results described in this poster will include deeper molecular characterizations of the immune microenvironments of these tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Tumor immunity,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Burles Avner Johnson<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Mingxiao Feng<sup><\/sup>, Woonyoung Choi<sup><\/sup>, Gabriela Colocho<sup><\/sup>, Alyssa Arbuiso<sup><\/sup>, Samuel Jin<sup><\/sup>, Adam K.

The cancer-killing functions of T cells are often compromised within tumors, allowing disease progression. Tumor-derived factors and the hostile microenvironment contribute to constraining of T cell effector functions and driving terminal differentiation. We previously identified that elevated extracellular K<sup>+<\/sup> characteristics of the tumor microenvironment limits both TCR dependent activation and effector functions, while preserving coincidently preserving T cell stemness (Eil R, <i>Nature<\/i> 2016 &#38; <i>Science<\/i> 2019). Despite these findings and the centrality of ion gradients to cellular physiology broadly, our understanding of T cell K<sup>+ <\/sup>transport remains rudimentary and cannot account for the pleiotropic role K<sup>+<\/sup> abundance plays in antitumor immunity. In fact, little is known about what K<sup>+<\/sup> transporters T cell express nor their functional regulation.<br \/>Findings: Here, we report the canonical Na<sup>+<\/sup>-K<sup>+<\/sup>-ATPase to be intertwined with T cell metabolic homeostasis, memory formation, and antitumor activity and therefore an appealing avenue for T cell reprogramming. We first performed whole-transcriptomic sequencing of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> memory subsets and found that components of the Na<sup>+<\/sup>-K<sup>+<\/sup>-ATPase were expressed at robust levels that were notably enriched in na&#239;ve and memory cells. Despite partially impairing Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> influx, T cells genetically deficient for the Na<sup>+<\/sup>-K<sup>+<\/sup>-ATPase exhibited constitutive activity in both TCR and Akt-mTOR associated signaling pathways along with rapid acquisition of co-inhibitory surface receptors, mitotic arrest, and functional exhaustion. Mechanistically, we identified pathologic ROS accumulation as the driver of unregulated signaling and rapid exhaustion. <i>In vivo<\/i>, T cells lacking deficient in Na<sup>+<\/sup>-K<sup>+<\/sup>-ATPase activity failed to achieve proliferative burst following pathogen challenge and demonstrated severely compromised antitumor function. Our results support a model in which the Na<sup>+<\/sup>- K<sup>+<\/sup>- ATPase primarily functions in T cells to maintain ROS metabolism, thereby preventing its pathologic accumulation and preserving T cell stemness and antitumor potential.<br \/>Conclusion: These results uncover a fundamental yet underappreciated aspect of T cell biology with translational implications for the ongoing development of cancer immunotherapies. Immediate applications include pharmacologic and genetic targeting of ion transporters in the setting of immune checkpoint blockade or T cell transfer therapies (i.e. CAR, TCR, TIL).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,T cell,Adoptive immunotherapy,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Camille Collier<sup><\/sup>, Matthew McWhorter<sup><\/sup>, Kelly Wucherer<sup><\/sup>, Chelsea Jenkins<sup><\/sup>, Alexandra Bartlett<sup><\/sup>, <b>Robert Eil<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e00c1e35-7720-4af7-9cc7-979a7254fee5","ControlNumber":"2738","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

We show that cIAP1 and cIAP2 are physically associated with the CD137 signaling polyprotein complex. Moreover, cIAPs are required for CD137 signaling towards the NF-&#954;B and MAPK pathways and for costimulation of human and mouse T lymphocytes. Functional evidence was substantiated with SMAC-mimetics that trigger proteasomal degradation of cIAPs and transfecting dominant-negative variants of cIAPs.

T cells are critical to the adaptive immune response to pathogens and cancers, mediating an antigen-specific response through both specificity and diversity of T cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes. Many methods exist to determine specific clonotypes and overall TCR diversity present from bulk tissues or sorted cell populations; however, nearly all fail to capture spatial orientation and arrangement of T cells engaging with their microenvironment, and most require large amounts of starting material from precious samples. Here, we present a TCR expression profiling panel for the GeoMx&#174; Digital Spatial Profiler that can be combined with the GeoMx Cancer Transcriptome Atlas (CTA) or Human Whole Transcriptome Atlas (WTA) on archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens. This represents the first commercial spatial expression profiling assay for the simultaneous quantification of TCR constant, variable, and joining segments <i><\/i><i>in situ<\/i>.<br \/>We show reliable sensitivity and specificity (&#62;90%) with respect to orthogonal sequencing and robust detection of TCR chains with evidence of clonal expansion and CD8 infiltration across tumor regions in colorectal cancer tissue. These events also corresponded to increased signatures of exhaustion from the T cells and suggest that the T cells resident in or near the tumor are tumor-specific and poised for activation via checkpoint blockade. Signaling pathways and tumor-specific signatures were also evaluated to look for mechanisms through which tumor cells respond to T cell infiltration. We further validated the performance of the TCR probe pool in cell pellet arrays with orthogonal TCR sequencing, tonsil and colorectal cancer tissues.<br \/>Together, the combination of our TCR add-on panel with the CTA or WTA illuminates T cell phenotypes, signaling pathways, population dynamics, and transcriptomic changes, yielding an unparalleled view of the T cell response in any context.<br \/>FOR RESEARCH USE ONLY.

Correlative human studies have highlighted the potential importance of chemokines on the status of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell infiltration into tumors and on patient survival. Here, we show that CXCL10, an IFN-&#947; induced chemokine, derived from ovarian cancer cells, contributes to impairing CD8<sup>+<\/sup>&nbsp;T cell antitumor immunity by regulating CD8<sup>+&nbsp;<\/sup>T cell exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment.&nbsp;Clinically, we found that&nbsp;CXCL10&nbsp;and its receptor CXCR3&nbsp;had a strong positive correlation with exhausted T cell signature genes&nbsp;in ovarian cancer patients in TCGA and in-house cohort.&nbsp;Functionally, we showed that&nbsp;CD8<sup>+<\/sup>&nbsp;T cell exhaustion was induced by CXCL10&nbsp;activation&nbsp;by CRISPRa&nbsp;from ovarian cancer cells,&nbsp;whereas&nbsp;inhibition by CRISPRi restored CD8<sup>+&nbsp;<\/sup>T cell antitumor immunity <i>ex vivo<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Mechanically, ovarian cancer cells-derived CXCL10 induced the expression of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells exhaustion transcription factors in a CXCR3-dependent manner, driving PD-1 and TIM-3 expression on CD8<sup>+<\/sup>&nbsp;T cells. Therapeutically, suppressing CXCL10 secretion from ovarian cancer cells enhanced the response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in the orthotopic mouse model. The results suggest that selectively inhibiting the oncogenic CXCL10 production may work effectively with ICBs in ovarian cancer immunotherapy. Our findings advance the understanding of the low response rate of immunotherapy in ovarian cancer and explore the potential mechanism underlying the induction of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Chemokines,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,T cell exhaustion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Runying Long<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Tao Ding<sup>1<\/sup>, Michelle K.L Siu<sup>1<\/sup>, David W Chan<sup>2<\/sup>, Jiangnan He<sup>1<\/sup>, Annie NY Cheung<sup>1<\/sup>, Kwan Man<sup>1<\/sup>, Hextan YS NGAN<sup>1<\/sup>, Karen KL Chan<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong,<sup>2<\/sup>The Chinese University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Hong Kong","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"65b9e7dc-2c4b-444b-8a91-246a10f8f3f3","ControlNumber":"6111","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.

While several E3 ubiquitin ligases and ubiquitin-specific peptidases regulate PD-L1 protein stability, the deubiquitinases involved in PD-L1 transcription for cancer cell immune evasion have not been identified. Herein, we developed a CRISPR-based screening platform and identified ATXN3 as a top positive regulator for PD-L1 transcription. Analysis of TCGA database revealed a statistically significant positive correlation between <i>ATXN3<\/i> and <i>CD274<\/i> expression in more than 80% human cancers, indicating that ATXN3 is a positive regulator for PD-L1 transcription in broad spectra of human cancers. ATXN3 promotes PD-L1 transcription induced by multiple tumor microenvironmental (TME) factors including inflammatory cytokine IFN-&#947; and hypoxia through protecting their downstream transcription factors IRF1, STAT3 and HIF-2&#945;. In addition, ATXN3 functions as a deubiquitinase of PD-L1 transcription factors YAP-1 and JunB, indicating ATNX3 promotes PD-L1 expression through multiple pathways. Targeted deletion of ATXN3 in cancer cells resulted in reduced PD-L1 expression and consequently enhanced antitumor immunity in mice, which are partially revised by reconstitution of PD-L1 expression. Further, tumoral ATXN3 suppression improves the preclinical efficacy of checkpoint blockade antitumor immunotherapy and partially dependent on CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Importantly, ATXN3 expression is increased in human lung adenocarcinoma and melanoma and its levels are positively corelated with PD-L1 as well as its transcription factor IRF1 and HIF-2&#945;. Collectively, our study identifies a previously unknown deubiquitinase ATXN3 as a positive regulator for PD-L1 transcription and provides a rationale for ATXN3 targeting in sensitizing checkpoint blockade antitumor immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ubiquitination,PD-L1,Transcriptional regulation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Shengnan Wang<sup><\/sup>, Radhika Lyer<sup><\/sup>, <b>Deyu Fang<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Northwestern Univ.

In OSCC, for example, <i>TP53 <\/i>R175H is a hot-spot, high-risk, functional mutation that inhibits the function of WT p53, however these correlations and functional roles of high-risk p53 mutations had not been experimentally addressed using syngeneic oral tumor models. To understand the functional role of <i>TP53<\/i> mutations in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and response to immunotherapy, we used a syngeneic oral tumor model (ROC3 cell) derived from a genetically engineered mouse model expressing the p53 R172H (human, R175H).<br \/>Methods: Orthotopic tongue injections were performed to (i) characterize tumor growth rate (ii) the TIME landscape by flow cytometry and opal multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF); and (iii) immunotherapy drug studies. We inactivated mutant p53 expression by shRNA and CRISPR Cas9, profiled gene expression changes by HTG EdgeSeq array, and validated these findings by qPCR, Western blot and immunochemistry. Tumor response was achieved by anti-PD1 and STING agonist therapies. Patients&#8217; gene expression analyzed by CIBERSORT and TIME landscape performed by mIF. The spatial distribution of TIME was evaluated by Visiopharm software and UMAP.<br \/>Results: We demonstrated that disruption of mutant p53R172H in ROC3 cells altered cytokine and chemokine expression levels and consequently affected the maturation and infiltration of different immune subsets, including cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, helper CD4+ T cells, Tregs, G-MDSCs, tumor-associated macrophages and neutrophils in ROC3 tumors. In addition, our spatial TIME analysis revealed that p53R172H mutation promoted the infiltration of Tregs, M2 macrophages, and exhausted CD8+ T cells, and excluded active CD8+ and CD11+ cells in both the tumor cores and on the tumor edges. Interestingly, it seems that p53R172H also regulates the spatial distribution of immunocyte populations, and their distribution between central and peripheral intratumoral locations. Moreover, we found that p53R172H mutation not only disrupted the phosphorylation of STING pathway which supported the recently reported finding, but also decreased the absolute amount of STING protein. Furthermore, we detected that p53-mutated tumor-infiltrating CD8+ and CD4+ T cells expressed programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and that these tumors responded to anti-PD-1 and STING agonist therapy. Furthermore, Human OSCC samples also revealed associations between immune cell populations and the TP53R175H mutation, which paralleled the findings from our ROC3 tumor model.<br \/>Conclusions: Our findings collectively demonstrate that the mutant <i>TP53<\/i> GOF mutation modulates the tumor immune landscape and is associated with reduced overall survival in patients with OSCC.<i><\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53,Immunotherapy,Oral cancers,syngeneic tumor model,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yewen Shi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaoyong Ren<sup>1<\/sup>, Shaolong Cao<sup>2<\/sup>, Tongxin Xie<sup>3<\/sup>, Xi Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Chieko Michikawa<sup>3<\/sup>, Abdullah  A.

Overexpression of EphA2 is common across many types of human cancer, particularly in the late stage malignant diseases. We report here that EphA2 knock-out causes delayed tumor growth in several syngeneic mouse caner models, such as breast, colon, lung, and prostate cancer as well as melanoma. However, such effects are missing in immune deficient mice, which suggests the involvement of immune components. Immunophenotyping of the tumors shows elevated T cell infiltration and accompanied by reduced MDSC population in the EphA2 KO tumors. Single cell transcriptomic analysis and cytokine measurements support these results showing increased production of CCL5, CXCL9 and IFNg in the EphA2 KO tumors. Analysis on tumors at very early time points reveals elevated levels of CXCL1 and CXCL2 which recruits suppressive MDSCs. Consistently, larger population of MDSCs was found in PBMCs from the control tumor bearing mice than those bearing EphA2 KO tumors. These results suggest that EphA2 in cancer cells drive the production of CXCL1 and CXCL2 to recruit suppressive MDSCs to the tumor site, thus subvert the host anti-tumor immune surveillance. Targeting the overexpressed EphA2 in cancer can help reshape the tumor micro- environment towards type I anti-tumor immune response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunosuppression,EphA2,Tumor initiating cells,Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Roger Xiaojun Shi<sup>1<\/sup>, Ryan Lingerak<sup>2<\/sup>, So-Yeon Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Wei Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Khalid Sossey-Alaoui<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Bingcheng Wang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Medicine, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH,<sup>2<\/sup>Physiology and Biophysics, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a42ee7c6-d877-48a7-a9ae-ee0c053f1902","ControlNumber":"6322","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.

This is particularly the case for malignancies that arise within hematopoietic tissues that closely interact with immune cells. We hypothesized that lymphoma-provoked changes to the adaptive immune system would differ based on age. To explore how the immune system is altered by both B-cell lymphoma and the aging process, we transplanted E&#956;-<i>Myc<\/i> lymphoma B-cells into mice aged 6-12 weeks or 20-24 months. Interestingly, as marked by reduced splenomegaly and lymphoma cell numbers, tumor burden was significantly reduced in aged hosts, suggesting lymphoma cells grow more slowly in the aged tissue microenvironment. Further, while lymphoma progression provoked losses in total numbers of normal T-cells, NK-cells, and B-cells in young individuals, aged lymphocytes were surprisingly resistant to lymphoma. Similarly, profound phenotypic changes in T-cell subpopulations that are provoked by E&#956;-<i>Myc<\/i> lymphoma in young individuals, such as increases in expression of CD44, CD69, PD-1, Foxp3, and Tox, were not manifest in lymphoma-bearing aged mice. In addition, immature NK cell population dynamics were altered by lymphomas differently among aged mice when compared to young mice. Finally, analyses of the chromatin state of enriched CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells from young and aged mice by ATAC-seq revealed that the aging process provoked marked alterations in the epigenome, and that lymphoma only provoked significant changes to the epigenome among young CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. We conclude that aging-driven epigenetic alterations manifest in the adaptive immune system renders these cells surprisingly resilient to lymphoma-mediated immune suppression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aging,Immune cells,Lymphoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Rebecca  S.

However, there have been limited studies on the independent role that progesterone and its receptor, the progesterone receptor, play in breast cancer development. Studies in our lab have shown that progesterone signaling promotes mammary tumor growth and changes the immune landscape of the mammary gland towards immunosuppression. Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) are immune cells known to promote immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, in part through decreasing the activity of anti-tumor CD8+ T cells. The data from our lab also show that progesterone increases the number of Tregs in the normal mammary gland. To determine if progesterone signaling increases the number of Tregs in the tumor-bearing mammary gland, we used a syngeneic orthotopic murine tumor model, E0771 cells, engineered to express mouse PR or control empty vector. Mice were treated with progesterone or placebo for 7 days before implantation of the modified E0771 cells. Results from this study show that progesterone promoted tumor growth, as well as changed the immune landscape of the tumor. Flow cytometry analysis at tumor endpoint showed that progesterone receptor-positive tumors treated with progesterone harbored more Tregs than placebo treated mice. Additionally, initial studies into activity markers harbored by Tregs in progesterone-treated mice indicate increased Treg activity following progesterone treatment. As progesterone treatment promoted tumor growth and Treg recruitment in progesterone receptor-positive tumors, these data imply that progesterone treatment may promote the release of secreted factors impacting the immune cells in the mammary microenvironment. To determine if progesterone treatment results in cytokine or chemokine changes that may affect Treg recruitment, cytokine arrays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were performed using cell culture supernatant from murine mammary tumor cells expressing progesterone receptor (E0771-PR) treated with progesterone (0-72 hours). E0771-PR cells treated with progesterone showed higher levels of cytokines and chemokines that have been linked to Treg recruitment and differentiation, such as CCL5. Our findings demonstrate that progesterone signaling promotes an immune suppressed microenvironment in the mammary gland through an increase in Tregs. This evidence provides rationale to investigate the use of anti-progestins as a mechanism to overcome the immune-cold tumor microenvironment seen in progesterone receptor positive breast tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Progesterone receptor,Progesterone,Tumor microenvironment,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Eilidh  I.

As we age our risk of developing most forms of cancer increases. Conversely, our immune function declines, and though over half of breast cancer patients are over the age of 60, fewer than 25% of clinical trial enrollees are patients in this age range. This is concerning given the expanding use of immunotherapies that rely on immune function, with early clinical trial results suggesting there may be age-associated responses to treatment. Here, we utilize a preclinical model of aging to understand how age impacts immune responses to triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).<br \/>Immunologically young (~8 week old) and aged (~12 month old) FVB mice were orthotopically injected with syngeneic Met1 TNBC cells. To mimic first-line therapies using chemotherapy combined with anti-PDL1, young and aged FVB mice were treated with paclitaxel or vehicle control and\/or anti-PDL1 once tumors became palpable. Tumors in young control mice grew significantly faster than in aged mice, resulting in shorter survival in young mice. Aged control mouse tumors exhibited infiltration of more CD8+ cytotoxic Tcells, but also more FOXP3+ inhibitory T-regulatory cells compared to young mice, despite aged mice having fewer circulating CD8+ and CD4+ lymphocytes. Tumor burden is reduced in young and aged mice on monotherapy, however only young mice receive a further benefit of combination versus monotherapy. Aged mice receive no benefit of combo therapy. Tumors in young mice have a significant increase in infiltration of both CD8+ and inhibitory Tregs with treatment, while aged mice experience no increase in Tcell infiltration with any treatment. GSEA of bulk RNA sequencing reveals that tumors in aged mice are significantly enriched for inflammatory and immune response programs compared to young mice - interferon alpha, interferon gamma, IL6, IL2, inflammatory response. Furthermore, tumors in aged mice have significant enrichment of the immune exhaustion markers PDL1, CTLA4, TIM3, and LAG3. Analysis of published single cell RNAseq data of human TNBC patients reveals the same signatures enriched with age as in our murine model. Furthermore, these pathways are predominantly enriched in the Tcell and fibroblast compartments.<br \/>Our model mimics both the chronological and immunological age spectra of breast cancer patients and illustrates differential responses to tumor progression, immune responses, and responses to therapy due to aging. Human single cell RNAseq corroborates our findings suggesting that TNBC looks like a molecularly different disease with age, and that there is an enrichment of immune and inflammatory response programs driving age-associated differences in tumor progression. Together this work highlights the importance of understanding how age impacts cancer and underlines the need for age-stratified treatment strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aging,Immune checkpoint blockade,Chemotherapy response,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Milos Spasic<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Adrienne Parsons<sup>1<\/sup>, Gregory Goreczny<sup>1<\/sup>, Qiuchen Guo<sup>1<\/sup>, John Hutchinson<sup>2<\/sup>, Elizabeth Mittendorf<sup>3<\/sup>, Peter van Galen<sup>1<\/sup>, Sandra McAllister<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Harvard Medical School\/Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA,<sup>3<\/sup>Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1650f87c-16d2-445c-98f6-2fad022c6524","ControlNumber":"7850","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Despite many differences between the cancers, liver transplant has found great success in treating both over traditional methods. However, up to 35% of patients&#8217; cancer still recur within five years. Given the risk and resource intensiveness of this treatment, it is critical to identify factors that influence recurrence in these cancers. Previous studies have found the micro-environments of HCC tumors tend to be immune-active while those of CCA tumors tend to be immunosuppressive. Increased immune activity at the tumor level is associated with better patient outcomes, but the role and impact of the regional immune response in liver cancer is not well understood. Liver draining lymph node tissue was collected from patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) for HCC, CCA, or other reasons (control). Nanostring GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) was used to measure immune marker levelsWe found increased immune activity in the LNs of patients with HCC compared to CCA, showing significantly higher levels of lymphocytes and immune activity markers, matching previous tumor microenvironment findings. Additionally, comparing recurrent and non-recurrent HCC or CCA samples, we see generally increased immune activity in non-recurrent lymph nodes, also identifying specific immune markers in both cancer types that correlate with cancer recurrence or non-recurrence. These also reveal patterns of activity specific to both cancer type and recurrence status. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the regional immune response in liver cancers and identifies candidate proteins to serve as predictors of recurrence in liver cancer. We suggest CD163, CD66b, CD8, and CD56 as markers to predict post-OLT HCC recurrence and CD163, CD66b, ID01, and OX40L as candidate markers to predict post-OLT CCA recurrence using LN samples. Further spatial analysis of this data may further characterize immune activity in these lymph nodes, and future studies focusing on identified differences in immune activity may reveal factors affecting liver cancer aggressiveness and recurrence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,Immune response,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Peyton Hickman<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Aubrey  E.

Interferon &#947; (IFN&#947;), a critical cytokine that promotes cellular immunity, also induces adaptive resistance to ICBT. Using syngeneic mouse tumor models, we confirmed that chronic IFN&#947; exposure confers resistance to anti-Programmed cell death protein 1 (&#945;-PD-1) therapy. We identified consistent upregulation of poly-ADP ribosyl polymerase 14 (PARP14) in both chronic IFN&#947;-treated cancer cells and patient<i> <\/i>melanoma with elevated <i>IFNG<\/i> expression. Knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of PARP14 increased effector T cell infiltration into tumors derived from cells pre-treated with IFN&#947; and decreased the presence of regulatory T cells, leading to restoration of &#945;-PD-1 sensitivity. Finally, we determined that tumors which spontaneously relapsed following &#945;-PD-1 therapy could be re-sensitized upon receiving PARP14 inhibitor treatment, establishing PARP14 as an actionable target to reverse IFN&#947;-driven ICBT resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-1,Interferons,Resistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chun Wai Wong<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Christos Evangelou<sup>1<\/sup>, Kieran N.
