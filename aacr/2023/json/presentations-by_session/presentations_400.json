[{"Abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the combined effects of KRAS targeted therapy and FAP targeted radiotherapy compared to either therapy alone in an animal model of lung cancer. KRAS is a protein that acts as a molecular switch regulating cell proliferation mediated through binding of GTP versus GDP. When mutated, the switch remains &#8220;on&#8221; and cells undergo unrestrained proliferation. KRAS mutations are frequently found in lung cancer and it appeared for years as if they could not be inhibited. Recently KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors have been developed by targeting a site adjacent to the binding pocket that induces a conformational change in the protein preventing GTP binding thus inhibiting unrestrained cell cycling. While a promising advance, KRAS targeted therapy does not confer a durable response and therefore it is essential to develop adjuvant therapies that enhance efficacy of KRAS targeting agents. FAP targeted radiotherapy is a new anticancer therapeutic that delivers a radioactive payload directly to tumors and has been shown to increase efficacy when used with immunomodulatory therapy. We studied the effect of KRAS targeted therapy alone and in combination with FAP targeted radiotherapy. Animals were implanted with KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> heterozygote LLC1 lung cancer cells and treated according to the following groups: untreated control, sotorasib treatment, <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-FAPI-04 treatment, and combined treatment. Tumor growth was evaluated every 2-3 days and animals were euthanized at 21 days and tumors extracted for analysis. anti-Ki67 and anti-caspase-3 immunofluorescence assessed cell cycling and apoptotic cell death, respectively. Immunoassays were performed to quantify soluble analytes, including IL-12p70, TNF-&#945;, TGF-&#946;1, and IFN-&#947;. Tumor growth in dual treated animals was significantly reduced compared to either therapy alone. Ki67 immunofluorescence demonstrated a significantly decreased number of cells in the combined therapy group than either therapy alone (p=0.01 and 0.02 when compared to sotorasib alone and radiotherapy alone, respectively). Anti-caspase-3 immunofluorescence demonstrated a significant increase in positive cells in the combined group compared to animals treated with sotorasib alone (p=0.003). Immunoassays assessing expression of TNF-&#945;, TGF-&#946;1, and IFN-&#947; from tumors from animals in each treatment group demonstrated statistically significant differences (p=0.006, p=0.03, p=0.02, respectively). Combined KRAS targeted therapy and FAP targeted radiotherapy results in decreased tumor growth compared to either therapy alone. Effects are mediated through decreased cell cycling, increased apoptotic cell death, and changes in key cell signaling pathways. Future translational studies will assess this therapy combination in patients to evaluate its ability to increase response to therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-01 Interactions of new agents with radiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Radiation therapy,Targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kathleen M.

Abemaciclib, a selective CDK4\/6 inhibitor, enhanced the radiosensitivity of NSCLC in vivo and in vitro and improved the prognosis of advanced NSCLC patients according to a Phase I clinical trial. This study aimed to explore the impact of CDK4\/6 inhibition combined with irradiation and immunotherapy on NSCLC. The in vivo xenograft tumor mouse model was used to investigate the synergistic effects of CDK4\/6 inhibitor abemaciclib and irradiation together with anti-PD-1 antibodies. The tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in tumor microenvironment (TME) were analyzed by flow cytometry. The complete blood count and serum tests were used to determine the safety of this combination therapy. The human phospho-kinase array and dual-luciferase report assay were used to study the regulatory mechanisms of abemaciclib and irradiation combination on PD-L1 transcription in NSCLC cells in vitro. Our results indicated the significantly synergistic effects of abemaciclib, irradiation and anti-PD-1 antibodies on NSCLC growth in vivo, accompanied by increased CD8+ T cell infiltration and decreased regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), suggesting a strong anti-tumor combination of CDK4\/6 inhibition, radiotherapy and immunotherapy. This synergistic effect could be partially impaired by CD8 depletion, and alleviated the anemia and inflammation caused by tumor burden without hepatorenal toxicity. Abemaciclib induced PD-L1 transcription through JNK\/c-Jun pathway in vitro, which might elevate PD-L1 expression synergistically with irradiation through TBK1\/IRF3 pathway. Our studies suggested that CDK4\/6 inhibition plus irradiation enhanced anti-tumor immune responses in NSCLC. Together with immunotherapy, the combination of CDK4\/6 inhibitors and radiotherapy could lower the doses of individual treatment, thus alleviating the potential toxicity and side effects of CDK4\/6 inhibition and irradiation on normal cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-01 Interactions of new agents with radiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK4\/6,PD-L1,NSCLC,Radiotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Zhengrong Huang<sup><\/sup>, Jiang Luo<sup><\/sup>, Mengqin Wang<sup><\/sup>, Hongxin Xie<sup><\/sup>, Yuxin Zeng<sup><\/sup>, Yu Yuan<sup><\/sup>, Wan Xiang<sup><\/sup>, Ziyu Jiang<sup><\/sup>, Conghua Xie<sup><\/sup>, <b>Yan Gong<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3e81e4ce-9299-4791-b01a-972bdcadfec6","ControlNumber":"542","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Z.

One such approach is RT in combination with high-dose recombinant interleukin 2 (IL-2), which elicits anti-tumor immune responses by stimulating T-cell and NK cell populations. Although effective for some patients, the overall clinical benefit of high-dose recombinant IL-2 is limited by toxicity and the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) through signaling events mediated by IL2R&#945; (CD25). Here we examined the cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway dependency of type I interferon (IFN) response and anti-tumor effect of RT in combination with NL-201, a highly potent and stable CD25-independent IL-2 and IL-15 receptor agonist with enhanced affinity for IL2R&#946; and IL2R&#947;<sub>c<\/sub>. In mice implanted with E0771 syngeneic tumors, NL-201 in combination with RT enhanced activation of the STING pathway. This was associated with increased type I IFN production as well as increased activation and number of tumor associated dendritic cells (DCs). In STING (-\/-) mice implanted with E0771 tumors, Type I IFN production, tumor-growth inhibition (TGI), and survival advantage was significantly decreased and there were significantly fewer activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Similarly, CD11c+ knock-out mice implanted with E0771 tumors and treated with the combination exhibited similar TGI, survival, and IFN production compared to vehicle treated mice. Based on these results, we tested the ability of the combination of RT and NL-201 to enhance systemic immunotherapy with an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor in mice implanted with 4T1 breast tumor cells. Tumor-bearing mice treated with the triple combination exhibited superior TGI and survival, along with increased effector memory T-cell populations as compared to all other treatment groups. These results support our previous findings that the CD25-independent IL-2 and IL-15 receptor agonist, NL-201, synergizes with RT, likely via the direct activation of STING. Genetic knockout of STING in tumor-bearing mice abrogated the activity of the NL-201 and RT combination, thus confirming the crucial role of innate immune sensors in the combination treatment&#8217;s immune activation and resulting antitumor effect. These results also describe the important role of STING-mediated activation and tumor penetration of DCs, which were crucial for anti-tumor response. Additionally, when combined with anti-PD-1 antibodies, NL-201+RT combination treatment significantly improved TGI of metastatic breast cancers that were previously resistant to checkpoint blockade. This work provides rationale for the continued exploration of RT in combination with CD25-independent IL-2R&#946;&#947; agonism<b> <\/b>as a means to enhance the systemic immune response to treat immunologically challenging tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-01 Interactions of new agents with radiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation therapy,Radioimmunotherapy,Interleukin-2,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Kristin Huntoon<sup><\/sup>, <b>DaeYong Lee<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Xuefeng Li<sup><\/sup>, Yifan Wang<sup><\/sup>, Wen Jiang<sup><\/sup>, Betty Kim<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"682c1be7-3176-4021-a842-c533ec6ec033","ControlNumber":"6093","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

A better understanding of the predominant pathways determining radiotherapy response could help develop mechanism-informed therapies to improve cancer management. PKM2, an enzyme that regulates the final rate-limiting step of glycolysis, has different functions in the occurrence, progression and metastasis of cancer. However, whether PKM2 plays a vital role in radioresistance is unclear, especially in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Here we report the upregulation of PKM2 in primary post-radiotherapy tumor tissues collected from radioresistant HNSCC patients. Using multidisciplinary approaches, we found elevated PKM2 in response to radiation, which confers radioresistance in HNSCC cells <i>via<\/i> extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1). Mechanistically, PKM2 activates STAT5 signaling pathway in HNSCC cells upon radiation, which enhances ECM1 expression. Moreover, ECM1 upregulation mediated by PKM2 prevents effector T cells from migrating to radioresistant head and neck tumors. While depletion of ECM1 overcomes PKM2-mediated radioresistance in orthotopic xenograft mice through altering the profile of chemo-attractants, which in turn remodels the tumor microenvironment to promote more cytotoxic T cells home to tumors. These novel and significant findings not only demonstrate a novel mechanism underpinning the interaction between tumor-derived PKM2 and immune cells in radioresistance but also provide a possible therapeutic strategy to overcome the failure of radiotherapy in HNSCC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-03 Molecular targets of radiation response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radioresistance,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Microenvironment,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Fanghui Chen<sup><\/sup>, Yang Fan<sup><\/sup>, Chris Tang<sup><\/sup>, Qin Richard<sup><\/sup>, Zheng Wei<sup><\/sup>, <b>Yong Teng<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Emory University, Atlanta, GA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"af946335-546c-44b6-97ae-36f4dc79ef0e","ControlNumber":"189","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

During DNA damage, miR-34 is directly upregulated by p53, inhibiting proliferation and promoting DNA repair. Accordingly, radiation therapy induces upregulation of miR-34 expression, coordinating several downstream radiation-induced stress responses. Recent work has demonstrated the existence of a stable, unphosphorylated pool of miR-34, which is rapidly phosphorylated and activated via loading onto Argonaute after ionizing radiation, independent of de novo transcription. Since Argonaute binding to the 5&#8217; phosphate is also important for miRNA stability, we hypothesize that a separate mechanism must exist to stabilize the unphosphorylated pool of miR-34. Mass spectrometry performed on co-precipitates of biotinylated mimics of unphosphorylated miR-34 identified predominantly nuclear proteins, with a notable enrichment for proteins localized in nuclear paraspeckles. Nuclear paraspeckles are a phase-separated nuclear subcompartment comprised of several key structural proteins and a long noncoding RNA NEAT1_2 that prevents mixing of internal contents with the rest of the nucleoplasm and are canonically implicated in regulating gene expression by sequestering inosine-modified mRNA. To further investigate the role of nuclear paraspeckles in the stability or sequestering of unphosphorylated miR-34, stable cell lines with deletion of a a motif required for stability of paraspeckles through disruption of the lncRNA NEAT1_2 were created (A549 NEAT1 dTH). Interestingly, luciferase reporter assays for miR-34 activity in the NEAT1 dTH lines showed a general loss of miR-34 activity after radiation compared to wildtype cells which exhibit radiation induced activation of miR-34. This loss of activity occurred both immediately after radiation, which is attributable to phosphorylation of the unphosphorylated pool, and at later time points after radiation, which has been attributed to de novo miRNA production. Ongoing research will monitor colocalization of proteins known to activate the unphosphorylated pool with paraspeckles to determine if paraspeckles coordinate activation of unphosphorylated miR-34, as well as will investigate the potential impact of disruption of paraspeckles on de novo miR-34 production. A better understanding of the interplay between nuclear paraspeckles and stress-responsive miRNA production may provide a means to selectively modify cancer stress responses and uncover novel mechanisms in miRNA production and coordination.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-03 Molecular targets of radiation response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,Noncoding RNA,Radiation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Graham  H.

TNBC has a substantial risk of locoregional recurrence and is difficult to cure due to absence of molecular targets or intrinsic heterogeneity. As radiotherapy (RT) is crucial in the treatment of BC, there is a need to identify novel molecular targets for increasing the efficacy of radiation therapy. BUB1 (Budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 1) is a serine\/threonine kinase implicated in chromosomal segregation during mitosis. However, it is still uncertain how BUB1 contributes to radioresistance in TNBC. By performing expression analysis (Oncomine), we observed that BUB1 is overexpressed in BC and even more in TNBC, indicating that this overexpression could be a prognostic factor for TNBC. MTT assay in several TNBC cell lines demonstrated that pharmacological (BAY1816032) or genomic (CRISPR) ablation of BUB1 was cytotoxic. By performing clonogenic survival assays, we observed that BUB1 ablation led to clinically meaningful radiosensitization in TNBC cell lines (SUM159, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468) with radiation enhancement ratios ranging from 1.1 - 1.38. In addition, we showed that inhibition of BUB1 kinase function is essential for the radiosensitization phenotype using siRNAs and CRISPR knockouts by depleting endogenous BUB1 and reintroducing wild-type (WT) or kinase-dead (KD) BUB1. We observed significant increase in tumor doubling time in SUM159 xenografts (mammary fat pads in CB17\/SCID mice) when BUB1i was combined with RT (DT=29.6 vs 7.9 days). A reduction in Ki67 was observed in these tumors further confirming the effectiveness of combination treatment. The effect of BUB1 depletion on DNA double strand break repair was assessed using &#947;-H2AX foci formation assay, which revealed sustained increase in &#947;-H2AX foci following radiation in BUB1i-treated cells. Further, BLRR assays confirmed that BUB1i reduces non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) efficiency. Biochemical analyses showed that BUB1i increases and stabilizes radiation-induced DNAPKcs phosphorylation (S2056). To evaluate the recruitment of DDR proteins to the chromatin following irradiation (IR), soluble nuclear and the chromatin-enriched fractionation was performed which demonstrated that cells pretreated with BUB1i had increased recruitment of DDR proteins to chromatin suggesting that BUB1 may play a role in the initial recruitment of NHEJ proteins to DSBs. Our findings demonstrate that both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of BUB1 sensitizes TNBC cells to RT and that BUB1 mediated radiosensitization may occur through NHEJ pathway. Our results suggest that BUB1 may represent a novel molecular target for radiosensitization in women with TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-03 Molecular targets of radiation response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),BUB1,BAY1816032,Radiotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sushmitha Sriramulu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Shivani Thoidingjam<sup>1<\/sup>, Pin Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Stephen L.

One potential strategy to improve outcomes for DMG patients is to inhibit Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM), an orchestrator of the cellular response to the DNA double-strand breaks. Previous research showed that <i>Atm<\/i> inactivation strongly enhanced the efficacy of radiation therapy for primary mouse models of <i>p53<\/i>-inactivated DMG. However, it remained unclear whether <i>Atm <\/i>inactivation would also radiosensitize DMGs driven by both <i>p53<\/i> loss and by H3.3K27M mutation. To induce primary DMGs driven by <i>p53<\/i> deletion and H3.3K27M expression in a lineage-controlled manner, we leveraged the RCAS\/TVA retrovirus system and a conditional <i>loxP-Stop-loxP-H3f3a-K27M-Tag<\/i> allele. We delivered retroviruses carrying (i) the oncogene platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGFB), (ii) Cre recombinase, and (iii) luciferase into the brainstems of pups with genotype <i>Nestin-TVA, p53-FL\/FL, loxP-Stop-loxP-H3f3a-K27M-Tag\/+; Atm-FL\/FL. <\/i>In these mice, RCAS retroviruses specifically transduce TVA-expressing <i>Nestin<\/i>+ neural stem cells to drive primary brain tumors in which Cre recombinase induces H3.3K27M-Tag and inactivates both <i>p53<\/i> and <i>Atm<\/i>. Mice were imaged bi-weekly through <i>in vivo <\/i>luciferase imaging until a tumor signal was detected. Mice then received 3 daily fractions of 10 Gy focal brain irradiation. Mice were monitored for survival and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to confirm appropriate expression or loss of different gene products. Preliminary analyses revealed similar time to tumor formation for these mice compared to littermate controls with intact ATM expression in their tumors (<i>Atm<\/i>-<i>FL\/+<\/i>). Additionally, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a significant increase in post-radiation median overall survival for these mice compared to the controls with intact tumoral ATM expression. Overall, these data suggest that (i) the RCAS\/TVA system can be combined with a unique conditional allele to generate primary DMGs bearing H3.3K27M in mice, (ii) <i>Atm<\/i> loss in the tumor cells does not appreciably affect tumor formation in these models, and (iii) <i>Atm<\/i> loss still significantly radiosensitizes <i>p53<\/i>-mutant tumors even in the presence of H3.3K27M. These results nominate ATM-directed therapies for further investigation as radiosensitizers in patients with TP53\/H3.3K27M-mutant DMG.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-02 Modification of radiosensitivity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ATM,Radiosensitization,Brain tumors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sophie  R.

LSCC is a type of lung malignancy that accounts for about 30% of all lung cancer cases. As there are no known actionable oncogenic drivers in LSCC, there is currently no FDA-approved targeted therapy for LSCC patients. Most still receive chemotherapy and radiotherapy for locally advanced disease. As such, there is a critical need for the identification of therapeutic targets in LSCC. The protein kinase TNIK represents a potential target for therapeutic intervention. A positive regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway, TNIK is implicated in promoting tumorigenesis and treatment resistance in different cancers. Importantly, <i>TNIK <\/i>copy number amplification is a signature genomic alteration in LSCC as it is observed in about 50% of LSCC patients. Recently, it was shown that disrupting TNIK activity with NCB-0846, a small-molecule inhibitor of TNIK, inhibited the proliferation of TNIK<sup>high <\/sup>LSCC tumors. To extend this finding, we investigated whether TNIK inhibition can sensitize LSCC tumors to chemo- and radiotherapy. By employing NCB-0846 and a panel of LSCC cell lines with low and high TNIK expression, we conducted short-term and long-term cell viability<i> <\/i>experiments to evaluate the synergy between TNIK inhibition and chemo- and radiotherapy. The combination of NCB-0846 with conventional chemotherapeutic agents was antagonistic. Interestingly, we observed that treating LSCC cells with NCB-0846 prior to ionizing radiation (IR) enhanced the tumor-killing effects of IR in a TNIK-specific fashion. The radiosensitizing effect was only observed in TNIK<sup>high<\/sup> but not in TNIK<sup>low<\/sup> cell lines. Further mechanistic studies suggested that TNIK inhibition may radiosensitize LSCC tumors by impairing the endogenous DNA damage repair process and G2\/M cell cycle arrest in response to IR. Consequently, tumor cells incurred elevated DNA damage from IR and underwent more catastrophic cell division events. To test whether TNIK inhibition radiosensitizes <i>in vivo<\/i>, we subcutaneously implanted in immunocompromised NSG mice LK2 (TNIK<sup>high<\/sup>) and KNS62 (TNIK<sup>low<\/sup>) human LSCC cells. The mice were treated with (1) vehicle control, (2) NCB-0846 only, (3) IR only, or (4) IR following pre-treatment with NCB-0846. We observed that pretreatment with NCB-0846 significantly potentiated the efficacy of IR in eradicating TNIK<sup>high<\/sup> LK2 tumors but not TNIK<sup>low<\/sup> KNS62 tumors. Overall, these results indicate that TNIK inhibition may be a viable strategy to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy in LSCC tumors with high TNIK expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-02 Modification of radiosensitivity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiosensitization,DNA damage response,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Triet  M.

The standard of care for newly diagnosed GBM patients includes surgery followed by combined radiation therapy (RT) and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) therapy. However, one of the therapeutic challenges is the inevitable resistance and recurrence after radiotherapy. Glioblastoma stem cells (GSC) are tumor initiating cells for GBM and plays key roles in radio resistance. Thus, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen using a radiation resistant GSC to identify potential RT sensitizing targets. We identified 139 potential RT sensitizing targets with a filter for only those genes associated with a greater than 2-fold reduction in representation with a p&#60;0.05. There were 22 genes with a direct function in key DNA double-strand break repair pathways including 5 genes central to non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ1, XLF, PRKDC, DCLRE1C, XRCC4, LIG4), 6 genes involved in homologous recombination (RAD51D, CYREN, ATM, TONSL, BRCA2, RFWD3), and 7 genes central to initial DNA damage sensing (RNF8, RNF168, TP53BP1, RAD17, FOXM1, RAD9A, RAD1). These results are consistent with the crucial role of DNA repair following radiation exposure and demonstrate the success of the screening. Besides that, one of the top hits is NANP (N-acylneuraminate-9-phosphatase), which is involved in sialic acid synthetic pathway. Knocking down of NANP causes more G2\/M arrest followed by apoptosis after radiation. &#38;#947;H2A.X staining and comet assay shows more DNA damage in NANP knock down cells after radiation. Transcriptome analysis reveals NANP inhibition restrain mesenchymal status and NF-&#38;#954;B pathway activation. Furthermore, activation of NF-&#38;#954;B pathway could rescue the RT-induced G2\/M arrest of NANP knock down cells. TCGA and CGGA dataset shows NANP is highly expressed in GBM patients and patients with NANP high expression have poorer survival. In conclusion, our study identified NANP as a novel radio-sensitizing target for glioblastoma by regulating NF-&#38;#954;B pathway and mesenchymal status of GSCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-02 Modification of radiosensitivity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiosensitivity,CRISPR,NF-&#954;B,Glioblastoma multiforme,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yingwen Ding<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Ze-Yan Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Ravesanker Ezhilarasan<sup><\/sup>, Aram S.

Radiation therapy (RT) is the standard of care for DMGs, but these tumors often recur locally within the high-dose radiation field. Therefore, it is imperative to discover methods of overcoming RT resistance. DMGs are often characterized by the presence of driving mutation in the tail domain of histone H3 that converts the 27th residue from a lysine to a methionine (termed H3K27M). Using liquid chromatography\/mass spectrometry &#8220;snapshot&#8221; metabolomics, we determined that human H3K27M-expressing cells (referred to as K27M cells going forward) possess altered metabolic profiles distinct from their H3-wildtype (H3WT) counterparts characterized by enrichment in metabolites associated with purine metabolism. RT-treated K27M isogenic-paired cells displayed K27M-specific increases in the abundance of both hypoxanthine and guanine and decreased abundance of guanosine, which can be degraded into guanine from mature guanylate species (GMP\/GDP\/GTP). Hypoxanthine and guanine are the substrates for HGPRT (encoded by <i>HPRT1<\/i>), the rate-limiting enzyme in purine salvage. Using publicly available data, pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGG) expressing K27M were found to have decreased <i>HPRT1 <\/i>transcript compared to H3WT tumors, and we found decreased HGPRT protein expression in K27M cell lines compared to their isogenic H3WT counterparts. The decreased abundance of guanosine, increased abundance of both purine salvage metabolites following RT, and decreased expression of HGPRT suggest impaired guanylate purine salvage in K27M cells that is exacerbated by RT. <b>We hypothesized that K27M cells are deficient in purine salvage and may rely on <i>de novo<\/i> purine synthesis (DNPS) for purine production following RT<\/b>. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that a clinically available, blood-brain penetrant inhibitor of DNPS increased RT-mediated killing of K27M neurospheres <i>in vitro<\/i>. Combination RT+DNPS inhibition (DNPSi) increased survival (38d post-implantation) over RT alone (31.5d post-implantation) in Rag1-KO mice bearing orthotopically implanted K27M tumors, but did not cure tumors. To understand potential mechanisms of treatment resistance, we interrogated metabolic pathway utilization with stable isotope tracing. Using 2,8-deuterium-hypoxanthine to interrogate purine salvage and <sup>15<\/sup>N-glutamine to interrogate <i>de novo <\/i>purine synthesis, we found an RT-mediated increase in purine salvage that could mediate resistance to DNPSi inhibition. Future experiments will determine whether inhibition of purine salvage has efficacy for those tumors that recur or progress following treatment with RT and DNPSi inhibition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-02 Modification of radiosensitivity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,Pediatric cancers,Metabolism,Radiation therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Erik  R.

Two clinical forms of rectal injury have been described: early and late. Early injury typically develops during RT and occurs to some degree in most patients. The condition is usually self-limiting, but can predispose patients to the development of late injury. Late rectal injury occurs in up to 25% of patients months to years after pelvic RT and is more concerning, since it can be irreversible and can have a major impact on a patient&#8217;s lifestyle. Development of new pharmacologic approaches to eliminate the risk of RT-dependent rectal injury remains an important goal. Although detailed mechanisms underlying normal tissue toxicities vary from tissue to tissue, the central underlying mechanism is abnormal wound healing involving endothelial dysfunction (ED) and subsequently fibrosis. Regardless of its cause, ED is characterized by an &#8220;uncoupled&#8221; endothelial NOS (eNOS) activity that generates superoxide (O<sub>2<\/sub><sup>-<\/sup>) and peroxynitrite (ONOO-) rather than NO. One mechanism for uncoupling in inflammatory conditions is oxidation of the reduced cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). The product of uncoupling, ONOO-, oxidizes BH4, initiating a feed forward mechanism to sustain uncoupling. Oral treatment with sepiapterin (PTC923), a tetrahydrobiopterin precursor, decreased infiltrating inflammatory cells and cytokine levels in mice with colitis. We therefore tested whether a synthetic PTC923 might mitigate radiation-induced colon injuries. C57L\/J wild-type 6-8-week-old males mice received 13.5 Gy total-body irradiation (TBI). Starting from 24 h post-irradiation, mice were treated once daily with 1 mg\/kg PTC923 for six days by oral gavage. Colon injuries were accessed on 6<sup>th<\/sup> day after IR by colonoscopy and scored by using distal-proximal endoscopic colitis scoring system (D-PECS). The system has a core inflammatory component of four non-co-linear parameters and decimal units to notable lesions or complications. Relative expression of cytokines IL-1&#946;, IL-6, IL-17&#945;, and TGF-&#946;1 in colon endothelial cells were measured by RT-PCR 8 days after IR. According with D-PECS estimation, post-irradiation colon injury was significantly reduced by PTC923 treatment: on the 6<sup>th<\/sup> day after TBI mice demonstrated D-PECS score 5.8&#177;1.48 vs 1.6&#177;0.55 D-PECS score for animals received PTC923 treatment after TBI (p-value=0.00). Increase of cytokines IL-6 and TGF-&#946;1 in the colon endothelium after TBI was effectively blocked by PTC923 treatment (IL-6: IR+Vehicle = 4.31&#177;1.31 fold increase vs IR+PTC923 = 1.29&#177;0.37 fold increase (p-value=0.0016); TGF-&#946;1: IR+Vehicle = 5.18&#177;0.66 fold increase vs IR+PTC923 = 2.01&#177;0.75 fold increase (p-value=0.00029)). In conclusion, these findings support the proposal that oral treatment with sepiapterin is a potential mitigator of colon injury caused by RT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-05 Radioprotectors and radiosensitizers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation therapy,Colon,Interleukin-6,TGF-&#946;,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Vasily A.

To optimize effectiveness of current therapeutic regimens, there is a clinical need to enhance radiotherapy-mediated killing by radiosensitizing agents. Radiosensitizers show great potential by accelerating DNA damage, production of free radicals and disturbing cell cycle processes by induction of cytostatic and -toxic effects, but pre-clinical drug efficacy testing methods are limited. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have emerged as clinically relevant in vitro screening tools to enable drug discovery for specific mutational and molecular subtypes of many cancer indications. Although some radiosensitizing agents have been identified, potential radiosensitizing effects of standard of care as well as novel anti-cancer drugs remain largely unknown. Here, we present a unique screening platform that enables radiosensitizer discovery by showing in-depth insight in cytostatic-and toxic changes and RT-drug synergy.<br \/>Methods: Twelve PDO models from colorectal, pancreas, breast, lung, melanoma, cervical and ovarian tumors were screened for responsiveness to potential radiosensitizing agents using our organoid screening platforms. PDOs were seeded in 384-wells format in suspension or 3D gel (for cell-titer-glo (CTG) or imaging purposes) and compound exposure (three concentrations) was performed prior to irradiation (0, 2, 4, 6, 10 Gy). Cell viability data was obtained using both CTG-based assays and high content imaging (HCI)-based assay. Assay robustness and reproducibility were ensured (Z-scores &#60;0.6, reproducible IC50 values). To assess radiosensitizing effects, data was normalized to non-irradiated control conditions. Morphological changes were assessed using HCI.<br \/>Results: Clear differences in radiosensitivity were observed, with six out of twelve PDOs showing sensitivity to 10 Gy RT (&#60;30% viability), one breast, two melanoma and two lung PDOs showing limited sensitivity (47-86% viability) and one ovarian PDO showing no response to RT (98% viability). A wide range of responses to the chemo-irradiation treatments were observed, with oxaliplatin exhibiting radiosensitizing effects in cervical and colorectal PDOs, gemcitabine in cervical PDOs and docetaxel showing radioprotective properties in melanoma PDO.<br \/>Conclusion and Discussion: Our novel platform for testing potential radiosensitizing anti-cancer agents holds great promise for advanced drug discovery in a clinically relevant and readily available PDO panel, harbouring a wide range of RT-sensitive to insensitive models. CTG and HCI read-outs offer both fast and in-depth assessment of cytotoxic and cytostatic effects and organoid morphology, creating omnipotent potential for tailored compound screening of radiosensitizers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-05 Radioprotectors and radiosensitizers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiotherapy,Radiosensitization,Organoids,Screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Liza Wijler<sup>1<\/sup>, Jara Garcia<sup>1<\/sup>, Muntaser Abdulrahman<sup>1<\/sup>, Linda van Seters<sup>1<\/sup>, My Nguyen<sup>1<\/sup>, Annelot Staes<sup>1<\/sup>, Bram Herpers<sup>2<\/sup>, Leo Price<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Marrit Putker<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Crown Bioscience Netherlands B.V., Utrecht, Netherlands,<sup>2<\/sup>Crown Bioscience Netherlands B.V., Leiden, Netherlands","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d85e61b6-c2ca-45f6-963e-8e25b6e0c9f7","ControlNumber":"6065","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

Since TNBC is resistant to hormone therapies, there are few effective therapies available for TNBC patients. One potential therapeutic strategy exists in targeting specific molecular components of an individual patient&#8217;s cancer. Prior work in our group has nominated monopolar spindle kinase I (TTK) as a gene upregulated in breast cancer patients. Specifically, TTK expression was found to be increased in cancerous breast tissue compared to healthy tissue and correlated with cancer recurrence following radiotherapy. Importantly, the implications of TTK inhibition and radiotherapy on the immune system is not well understood. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of combined TTK inhibition and radiotherapy in syngeneic murine mouse models. We hypothesize that TTK inhibition will radiosensitize murine TNBC models to radiotherapy both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo <\/i>and modulate the immune tumor microenvironment.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Cell viability assays were implemented to determine the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50<\/sub>) of TTK inhibitor. Clonogenic survival assays were used to determine the radiation enhancement ratios (rERs) of TTK inhibition <i>in vitro<\/i>. Syngeneic murine mouse models were used to assess therapeutic effects of TTK inhibition and RT <i>in vivo<\/i>. 4T1 TNBC cells were injected bilaterally into the flanks of BALB\/c mice and treated with combinations of radiotherapy and TTK inhibition. Tumor growth was monitored and, following the completion of the study, final tumor weights were recorded and tumor tissue was collected to perform immunofluorescent microscopy.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Single-agent TTK inhibition via treatment with the ATP-competitive inhibitor empesertib inhibits the growth of murine TNBC cell lines with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values up to 30nM. Sub-IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of TTK inhibitor induced radiosensitization in the murine TNBC cells 4T1 (rERs &#8804; 2.4) and Py8119 (rERs &#8804; 1.6). TTK knockdown also resulted in changes in radiosensitization <i>in vitro<\/i>. Furthermore, we also observed a similar phenotype <i>in vivo<\/i>. In our 4T1 model system, mice receiving combined treatment had significantly decreased tumor growth compared to mice that receiving single-agent therapies or vehicle control alone. Quantities of monocyte derived suppressor cells and CD8+ T cells were altered with radiotherapy and TTK inhibition.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Our data suggests that TTK inhibition and radiotherapy is synergistic in murine TNBC and alters the tumor immune microenvironment. This combined therapy suggests that changes in the underlying immune mechanisms as a result of the synergistic treatment efficacy are important in TNBC. Future work will examine the underlying mechanisms of TTK inhibition and radiotherapy on systemic and tumoral immune changes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-06 Radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation therapy,Radiosensitization,Breast cancer,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kassidy  M.

This study used global metabolomics profiles of breast cancer populations to identify metabolic pathways and biomarkers that are significantly associated with RT-induced EASRs to identify potential targets for precision interventions.<br \/>Methods: Using a frequency-matched study design, pre-RT urine samples from 60 female breast cancer patients receiving RT after breast-conserving surgery were metabolically profiled. Patients were recruited from the University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center and Jackson Memorial Hospital. Using MetaboAnalyst 3.0, we performed metabolomic data analysis, visualization, and interpretation on 84 candidate metabolites from a dataset of 478 total compounds. Student&#8217;s t-tests, correlation analyses, pathway enrichment, and topology analyses were conducted sequentially to identify metabolite biomarkers and pathways associated with RT-induced EASRs.<br \/>Results: The study population consisted of 24 African American (40%), 18 non-Hispanic white (30%), 14 Hispanic white (24%), and 4 &#8220;other&#8221; (7%) patients with frequency matched by race\/ethnicity and body mass index (BMI) categories (i.e., normal, overweight, and obesity) to have an equal number of high (n=30) and low (n=30) EASRs. Seven metabolic pathways were significantly associated with RT-induced EASRs, including alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism; caffeine metabolism; pentose and glucuronate interconversions; glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism; beta-alanine metabolism; pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis; and glutathione metabolism. The alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism pathway had the lowest false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p-value (p=0.0028) and the highest pathway impact value (0.60) of all enriched metabolic pathways. Thirteen metabolite biomarkers were significantly associated with RT-induced EASRs, including the principal compound of interest glutamate.<br \/>Conclusions: In our study of breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant RT, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism had the highest impact value and significant FDR-adjusted p-value in predicting RT-induced EASRs. Our findings suggest that glutaminase inhibitors may have broader clinical applications in preventing RT-induced EASRs in addition to their potential enhancement of chemotherapy by triggering metabolic crises in tumor cells.<b> <\/b><br \/>Keywords: breast cancer, metabolomics, radiation therapy, and early adverse skin reactions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-04 Normal tissue\/cellular stress responses to radiation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Metabolomics,Radiation therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alexandra  N.

Therefore, precise therapy on newly diagnosed GBM and increase median OS through concurrent tumor treating fields (TTFields) and chemoradiotherapy (the standard-of-care treatment proposed by NCCN) is of great significance. Though introducing latex-free sponge media was reported beneficial for improving concurrent TTFields and chemoradiotherapy efficacy on GBM, the specific enhancement mechanism and physical\/chemical parameters of sponge media has not been studied as far as we know. Herein, different latex-free polyurethane sponges were selected based on SPARE phase II clinical research to investigate their impact on the concurrent TTFields and chemoradiotherapy efficacy on GBM. As computed tomography (CT) imaging of tumor and radiation dose are two vital factors for radiotherapy, the Hounsfield unit (HU) values of sponges were tested under Micro-CT firstly and the results suggest that the sponges with HU value lower than -750 have almost no impact on CT image, and clearer CT image is obtained upon the sponge with lower HU value. Moreover, eight clinical IMRT\/VMAT plans were selected randomly and delivered into the bare (as a reference) or each-of-samples-surrounded CIRS head phantom with built-in EBT film to evaluate dosimetry effect. Film-based Gamma Passing Rate (2%\/2 mm criteria, 20% threshold) analysis indicates that all the dose distributions upon three sponges (99.55&#177;0.23, 99.54&#177;0.22 and 99.59&#177;0.19, respectively) are in good consistence with that over the reference (99.31%~99.98%). Importantly, the enhancement mechanism of latex-free sponge on concurrent TTFields and radiotherapy efficacy was studied and it corroborated that the introduced sponge could reduce the artifacts of target delineation generated in the presence of transducer array, decrease the position error of transducer array movement\/replacement on scalp, lower constrictive injury during TTFields therapy (especially for locating transducer array position upon CT imaging), and reduce the adverse event of TTFields including irritant or allergic contact dermatitis caused by transducer array in the period of radiotherapy.

Nevertheless, as today, their efficacy is limited. We investigated whether externally applied magnetic fields and non-ablative hyperthermia affect cancer cell viability and growth.<br \/>Methods: Under in vitro conditions, human A2058 melanoma, AsPC1 pancreas carcinoma, and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells were treated with electromagnetic fields (EMFs, using solenoids) and\/or hyperthermia (HT, using a thermostated water bath). The effect of both energies was also studied in combination with standard chemotherapy and targeted therapy. An experimental system combining EMFs and HIFU-induced HT was developed and tested in vivo.<br \/>Results: EMFs (25 &#956;T, 4h) or HT (52&#186;C, 40 min) quite moderately affect cancer cell viability. However, their combination decreased viability to approx. 16%, 50%, and 21% of controls values in A2058, AsPC1, and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively). Increased lysosomal permeability, release of cathepsins into the cytosol and activation of the mitochondria-dependent cell death are the underlying mechanisms. Cancer cells were completely eliminated combining EMFs, HT and standard chemotherapy or EMFs, HT and anti-Hsp70-targeted therapy. In vivo experiments, using pancreatic cancer xenografts growing in nude mice, show that combination of EMFs, HIFU-induced HT and gemcitabine induces a drastic cancer regression (to approx. 3-4% of control values).<br \/>Conclusion: Non-invasive NIR (EMFs and HIFU-induced HT) can complement current Oncotherapies. This strategy, associated to current chemotherapy or anti-Hsp70-targeted therapy, may facilitate the elimination of tumors that can be previously located using standard imaging techniques (CT scan and NMR). These results may help to overcome the limitations in the use of different NIR in Oncotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-06 Radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation therapy,Hyperthermia,Lysosome,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Elena Obrador<sup>1<\/sup>, Ali Jihad-Jebbar<sup>1<\/sup>, Rosario Salvador-Palmer<sup>1<\/sup>, Rafael López-Blanch<sup>1<\/sup>, María Oriol-Caballo<sup>1<\/sup>, María Paz Moreno-Murciano<sup>2<\/sup>, Enrique Navarro<sup>3<\/sup>, Rosa Cibrián<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Jose M.

The current GBM treatment strategy is chemotherapy drug temozolomide (TMZ) combined with radiotherapy (RT), which has limited treatment effect, poor prognosis, high recurrence rate, and short prognosis survival time. Recently, studies indicated that breast cancer susceptibility gene 1\/2 (BRCA1\/2) mutations are frequently occur in GBM, while few studies have explored this pathway in depth. At present, AZD2281 (PARP Inhibitor) has been used to treat breast cancer and ovarian cancer patients with BRCA1\/2 mutation...etc. Whether AZD2281 can play a role in affecting the relevant pathways after BRCA1\/2 mutate GBM patients, and the possible mechanism and benefit of combined RT are the focus of this study. AZD2281 is the first Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of germline BRCA mutation-associated ovarian cancer. AZD2281 is a targeted therapy that used to block DNA Damage Response (DDR) in cells\/tumors deficient in homologous recombination repair (HRR). After RT, there may be a phenomenon of DNA repair; therefore, AZD2281 can be used to disrupt the repair process. At the beginning, we used RSI analysis to confirm that patient with higher expression level of BRCA1 may relatively resistance to RT. To overcome this issue, we identified the effect of AZD2281 combined with RT on GBM cells (BRCA1\/2 higher and lower expression cells) by (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT assay), and colony formation. The internal\/external apoptosis pathways (Caspase-3\/Caspase-8\/Caspase-9) and TUNEL assay were used to prove the superior apoptosis effect of AZD2281 combined with RT as compared to single treatment. Additionally, cells lower BRCA1 expression level (U87 and U251 siBRCA1) may sensitive to RT treatment. In our DNA damage, DNA fragmentation, and transwell invasion\/migration results, we showed that the combination of AZD2281 and RT may effective induce DNA damage. In our animal data, we proved that combination therapy can effective suppression tumor growth and apoptosis-related protein signaling increased in DNA damage by IHC (p-ATM\/p-CHK2\/Caspase-3\/Caspase-8\/Caspase-9). In conclude, we suggested that AZD2281 can be used as a radiosensitizer to sensitize GBM patient to RT, which is dependent to BRCA1 expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-02 Modification of radiosensitivity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiosensitivity,Glioblastoma,BRCA1,PARP inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tsal-Lan Liao<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, I-Tsang Chiang<sup>2<\/sup>, Yuan Chang<sup>3<\/sup>, Fei-Ting Hsu<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>China Medicial University, (Individual), Taichung, Taiwan,<sup>2<\/sup>Medical Administrative Center, Show Chwan Memorial Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Medical Imaging, Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, New Taipei City, Taiwan,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a33fbfb4-e632-4f3b-99ff-50b58b0214ee","ControlNumber":"2764","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

The aim of this study is to identify a radioresistant protein from proteomics and explore its molecular mechanism.<br \/>Methods and Materials: The proteomic data of pre-treatment biopsy tissues of 18 ESCC patients with CCRT (complete response CR group, n = 8; incomplete response &#60;CR group, n = 10) was collected, combined with PXD021701 to explore the radioresistant candidate. Subsequently, immunohistochemistry of 126 paraffin embedded biopsies was used for validation. The ESCC cell models with overexpression, knockdown or knockout of Acetyl-CoA Acetyltransferase 2 (ACAT2) were applied for exploring its effects on radioresistance using clonogenic assay underwent ionizing radiation (IR). ROS, C11-BODIPY, Fer-1 (ferrostatin inhibitor) and western blotting analysis were employed to reveal the potential mechanism ACAT2 triggered after IR.<br \/>Results: Enrichment analysis of differentially expressed proteins (&#60;CR <i>vs.<\/i> CR) showed that the pathways of CCRT resistance molecules in ESCC were related to lipid metabolism, while the sensitive ones were mainly aggregated to immunity pathways. ACAT2 was selected from proteomics and verified as a risk factor of overall survival and a radioresistant factor among ESCC patients with CCRT or radiotherapy by immunohistochemistry. ACAT2 overexpression conferred ESCC cell resistance to IR treatment, whereas the ACAT2 knockdown or knockout ones were sensitive to IR. ACAT2 knockout cells were prone to produce ROS and enhance lipid peroxidation after IR, which was rescued by Fer-1. ACAT2 knockout also inhibited GPX4 and phosphorylation of AKT-S473 site after IR.<br \/>Conclusion: ACAT2 is negatively associated with the response of radiotherapy and prognosis of ESCC patients, suggesting ACAT2 as an effective therapy target to enhance radiosensitivity of ESCC.

It was aggressive in local invasion and further metastasis, especially pulmonarymetastasis. Radiotherapy (RT) was a clinical treatment method that using high-energy ionizingradiation to control tumour growth with low risk and considerably successful rate.Contradictorily, OS was recognized as radio-resistant tumour. Meanwhile, majority of OScases were diagnosed suffering depression and influence patient&#8217;s conditions critically. Hence,aim of this prospective study was to identify that combinational therapeutic efficacy ofradiation therapy and fluoxetine (Prozac) through mediating radiosensitivity and inhibitmetastasis of OS cells via RANK\/RANKL signaling. OS cell lines U2OS and MG63 were usedin this study. To investigate the cells survival fraction, clonogenic assay were performed. Next,to examine metastasis and invasions of cells wound healing assay and transwell assay werecarried out. Furthermore, TUNEL assay was used to evaluate DNA damage of OS cells.Fluoxetine effectively inhibited the metastasis and invasion ability of OS cells. Thecombinational therapy of fluoxetine and RT successfully decreased the surviving fraction ofOS cells and induced the damage of DNA. Additionally, the protein expression ofRANK\/RANKL was markedly suppressed by fluoxetine as illustrated by Western blottingassay.

The prognosis of GBM is still poor despite first-line therapy, and the median overall survival (OS) is 12-15 months, while the 5-year survival does not exceed 5%. Despite aggressive initial treatment, most patients develop recurrent diseases. Novel drug combinations for malignant CNS tumors are under investigation. Panobinostat is a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) with antineoplastic and antiangiogenic effects in glioma, and we previously noted synergy with combination of panobinostat and imipridone ONC206. ONC206 is under clinical investigation for treating adult and pediatric brain tumor patients. We decided to investigate the triple combination of ONC206, Panobinostat and radiation against glioma cells.<br \/>Materials &#38; Methods: We investigated cell viability and drug synergies of ONC206 plus Panobinostat with or without radiation in 4 human GBM cell lines at 72 hours.<br \/>Results: We identified synergy between impridone ONC206 and Panobinostat which improved with radiation therapy IC50 values of panobinostat and ONC206 against cell lines U138, U87, T98G &#38; U251MG ranges from 29-85 nM &#38; 0.8-1.2 &#956;M, respectively.

Human papilloma virus (HPV) incidence is a major cause of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in addition to tobacco use. HPV- HNSCC patients are less responsive to frontline treatment than HPV+ HNSCC patients. However, HPV- and HPV+ HNSCC patients are treated similarly. The cell cycle serine-threonine kinase polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is known to be overexpressed in HNC. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that high expression of Plk1 correlates with worse survival in HNSCC patients (p&#60;0.05). Yet, Plk1 is expressed at similar levels when comparing HPV- and HPV+ HNSCC patients. Therefore, in this study we sought to establish if Plk1 inhibition with onvansertib (currently in Phase I\/II clinical trials) alone and in combination with radiation would inhibit HPV- and HPV+ HNSCC growth. We used two HPV+ (UMSCC47, UDSCC2), and two HPV- (HN5, Cal27) human HNSCC cell lines. First, we confirmed that Plk1 inhibition with onvansertib stalls HNSCC cells at the G2\/M phase of the cell cycle (n=3). Then, we determined that HNSCC cell viability is reduced in a dose-dependent manner after Plk1 inhibition with onvansertib. Surprisingly, HPV- HNSCC cells exhibited a 2-fold decrease in cell viability as compared to HPV+ HNSCC cells (n=3). These findings were confirmed when assessing 3D spheroid growth of HNSCC cells. Plk1 inhibition with onvansertib (25nM) reduced HPV- HNSCC spheroid growth more than HPV+ (n=2). Combining Plk1 inhibition with radiation also reduced colony formation (n=3, p&#60;0.0001) and increased G2\/M stalling (n=3) compared to either single agent in HPV- HNSCC cells. Functionally, onvansertib induces cleaved PARP and pPlk1 expression in HNSCC cells. However, pPlk1 is induced to a higher degree in HPV+ HNSCC cells potentially indicating a positive feedforward loop leading to decreased sensitivity to Plk1 inhibition. In HPV- but not HPV+ HNSCC cells, Plk1 expression is also increased after radiation emphasizing Plk1 as an attractive target to mitigate radioresistance in HPV- HNSCCs (n=3). Our findings that HPV+ HNSCC cells are more resistant to Plk1 inhibition than HPV- HNSCC cells provides novel mechanistic insight into these disease subtypes. As HPV- HNSCC is typically more resistant to standard therapies, these results support a novel combinatorial approach using an already approved Plk1 inhibitor with radiation to improve HPV- HNSCC patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-06 Radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Radiation therapy,Polo-like kinase,Human papillomavirus (HPV),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Julianna Korns<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Samuel Thompson<sup>1<\/sup>, Trisha Wise-Draper<sup>2<\/sup>, Vinita Takiar<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Hematology\/Oncology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b060d90e-1703-4fca-9346-89cae4c7f0d6","ControlNumber":"3859","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

RD is a common and potentially treatment-limiting skin toxicity that occurs following RT. When the treated tumor is close to the skin, as in head and neck or breast cancer, RD is the most common acute adverse event which negatively impacts patients&#8217; quality of life; however, evidence-based treatments are limited. We performed RNA sequencing of RT-treated skin in both human skin and a murine model, which each showed increased expression of IL-17 Receptor type C (IL-17RC). To further explore the role of the IL-17 pathway in the development of RD, both genetic knockout of IL-17RC and pharmacologic blocking of IL-17A in mouse models were studied, and both were found to have attenuated histopathological signs of RD, including inflammation, acanthosis, and fibrosis when compared to controls. After establishing the importance of the IL-17 pathway on RD, we explored the impact of such IL-17 pathway modification on the anti-tumorigenic efficacy of RT, an important step when considering a future IL-17 neutralizing therapy for RD. A Trans-PyMT murine model of triple-negative breast cancer was used to evaluate the impact of IL-17A neutralization on RT efficacy. There was no difference found in the efficacy of RT in mice treated with IL-17A neutralizing antibody as compared with saline control. Overall, we present a clinically relevant murine model which advances our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of RD and suggests further exploration of targeted therapies for RD prophylaxis is warranted. Additionally, we show that modifying the IL-17 pathway is effective in mitigating RD phenotype with no impact on RT efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-05 Radioprotectors and radiosensitizers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation therapy,Interleukin-17,Mouse models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Megan  E.

Radiation is a cornerstone therapy but poses high risk of healthy tissue necrosis. Despite maximal treatment, GBM results in death within 15-21 months of diagnosis. These poor statistics suggest the need for a novel therapy. The use of radiosensitizing agents is a novel approach to minimizing radiation mediated healthy tissue necrosis by allowing use of lower doses to achieve comparable cytotoxic effects. Our lab has shown that sodium sulfide (Na<sub>2<\/sub>S), a hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2<\/sub>S) donor, selectively kills GBM (T98G) cells while sparing normal human brain endothelial (hCMEC\/D3) cells. Na<sub>2<\/sub>S also selectively radiosensitizes GBM cells and enhances cell killing with photon or proton radiation. We are currently exploring Diallyl Trisulfide (DATS), another H<sub>2<\/sub>S donor, as a radiosensitizing agent and have demonstrated that DATS can kill GBM cells. At a given dose of 2 Gy, radiation alone decreases T98G survival by 10%. With DATS, survival decreases by 70%, suggesting an additive effect. To determine if DATS increases DNA damage mediated cell death, T98G cells were treated with DATS, radiation, or combined DATS + radiation treatment and then analyzed for &#947;H2AX foci, an indicator of double stand breaks (DSB). Our results show that compared to no treatment, DATS increased the number of &#947;H2AX foci per cell by 1.5-fold, by 3-fold with radiation, and by 4-fold with combined DATS + radiation, an additive response. To elucidate the mechanism of increased DNA damage, a novel fluorescence multiplex host cell reactivation (FM-HCR) reporter system was used to assess repair activity of DSBs in live cells. T98G cells pre-treated with DATS were transfected with reporter plasmids containing site-specific lesions, mimicking radiation-like DNA damage. Repair resulted in expression of a fluorescent reporter protein, which was quantitated using flow cytometry. Our results show that DATS did not alter non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous repair (HR) activity of DSB. However, DATS did alter base excision repair (BER) activity by decreasing repair of abasic lesions and increasing repair 8oxoG lesions. We hypothesize that this attempted BER via simultaneous strand cleavage by AP endonuclease (Ape1) or glycosylase (Ogg1) may lead to build up of repair intermediates, threatening genomic stability and inducing DSB.

Among those, titanium nanoparticles are attractive candidates for application as radiosensitizers. We have newly established and evaluated titanium peroxide nanoparticles (TiOxNPs). The TiOxNPs are generated from titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO<sub>2<\/sub>NPs), manufactured via direct reaction of TiO<sub>2<\/sub>NPs with hydrogen peroxide. Distinguished characteristics of the TiOxNPs are continuous generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by X-ray irradiation. Bio-availabilities and safety was previously reported (Nanoparticles, 2020; 10(6): 1125).<br \/>Materials and Methods: Characteristics of TiOxNPs were determined following experiments. Dynamic light scattering analysis was used to measure the diameter and Z-potential of the NPs. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) observation revealed the detailed topology of the NPs. X-ray irradiation was performed using the X-ray generator at a voltage of 150 kV and a current of 5 mA with a 1-mm thick aluminum filter in vitro and in vivo. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was evaluated using human pancreatic cancer cells, named MIAPaCa-2. The cells were stained with 50 &#956;M carboxy-20,70-dichlorofluorescein (C-H2DCF) incubated for 45 min, and then stained with Hoechst for nuclear staining. The degree of fluorescence of C-H2DCF was detected using the fluorescence microscope. To evaluate cytotoxic effects of TiOxNPs, a colony-formation assay was performed. For xenograft experiments, the MIAPaCa-2 cells (2 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> cells) were injected subcutaneously into the hind legs of the BALB\/cAJcl nude mice. Once the tumor volume reached 100-200 mm3, mice were randomly assigned into six groups: the control group, TiOxNPs alone, 5 Gy alone, and TiOxNPs combined with 5 Gy. Tumor size, body weight, and health condition of all mice were followed every two to three days for 55 days post-treatment.<br \/>Results: Primary particles smaller than 10 nm gathered and formed secondary particles that were approximately 50 nm in diameter, and their Z-potential was -30 mV. TEM observation revealed the detailed topology of the NPs. The TiOxNPs enhanced H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub> production more than 7-folds compared to X-ray irradiation alone in MIA PaCa-2 cells. In xenografts, combination effects of the TiOxNPs and X-ray irradiation were significantly greater than X-ray irradiation (5 Gy) alone.<br \/>Conclusions: The TiOxNPs revealed to be powerful radiosensitizers in pancreatic cancer model. Clinical tests are warranted to clarify the application of TiOxNPs in the nearest future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-05 Radioprotectors and radiosensitizers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Radiosensitization,Pancreatic cancer,Reactive oxygen species,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ryohei Sasaki<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hiroaki Akasaka<sup>1<\/sup>, Masao Nakayama<sup>1<\/sup>, Yoshiko Fujita<sup>1<\/sup>, Hikaru Kubota<sup>1<\/sup>, Kenta Morita<sup>2<\/sup>, Mennaallah Hassan<sup>3<\/sup>, Mohammed Salah<sup>4<\/sup>, Yuya Nishimura<sup>5<\/sup>, Naritoshi Mukumoto<sup>1<\/sup>, Takeaki Ishihara<sup>1<\/sup>, Daisuke Miyawaki<sup>1<\/sup>, Chiaki Ogino<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Radiation Oncology, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Chemical Science and Engineering, Kobe University Graduate School of Engineering, Kobe, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Clinical Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Sohag University, Sohag, Egypt,<sup>4<\/sup>Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, South Valley University, Qena, Egypt,<sup>5<\/sup>Kobe University Graduate School of Science, Technology and Innovation, Kobe, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"367607c6-54c6-4660-b251-f60717bc1595","ControlNumber":"1391","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.

The therapeutic potential of RLTs strongly depends on their uptake and residence time in tumors and in the healthy structures after administration. Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP) is a cell surface antigen abundantly expressed in the microenvironment of the majority of solid human cancers of epithelial origin. We have recently described OncoFAP, an ultra-high affinity ligand of FAP whose targeting performances have been validated by Nuclear Medicine in patients with a wide variety of solid malignancies. Multivalent OncoFAP radioligand therapeutics (OncoFAP-RLTs) show high and prolonged tumor uptake with favorable tumor-to-organ ratios. Here we describe the development of novel multivalent OncoFAP-RLTs and their combination with a clinical-stage tumor-targeted interleukin-2 (L19-IL2). We designed and synthesized a set of multivalent OncoFAP derivatives, aiming at maximizing their affinity for the target protein and their residence time in the catalytic pocket of FAP. The multivalent ligands were coupled to the DOTAGA chelator, suitable for radiolabeling with <sup>177<\/sup>Lu for therapeutic application. The tumor targeting properties of the multivalent OncoFAP ligands were investigated in a comparative biodistribution study in SK-RC-52.hFAP tumor-bearing mice. <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-OncoFAP-23 emerged for its superior uptake and residence time in tumors and for its favorable tumor-to-kidney ratio. Moreover, when administered at very low dose <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-OncoFAP-23 exhibited an enhanced anticancer activity compared to a monovalent (<sup>177<\/sup>Lu-OncoFAP-DOTAGA) and bivalent (<sup>177<\/sup>Lu-BiOncoFAP-DOTAGA) version of OncoFAP. When OncoFAP-based RLTs were combined with L19-IL2, a strong synergistic anticancer activity was observed. This synergy is driven by NK-cell mediated immune response directed to the tumor, with the concomitant release of granzymes and other pro-apoptotic proteins in the tumor microenvironment. Our findings heighten OncoFAP-based RLTs as promising anti-cancer drugs for treatment of FAP-positive tumors, alone or in combination with targeted interleukin-2.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET08-06 Radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation therapy,Targeted therapy,Tumor targeting,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Andrea Galbiati<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Matilde Bocci<sup><\/sup>, Ettore Gilardoni<sup><\/sup>, Aureliano Zana<sup><\/sup>, Dario Neri<sup><\/sup>, Samuele Cazzamalli<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Philochem AG, Otelfingen, Switzerland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"544c732c-8e3d-4b7d-9225-2329f347829d","ControlNumber":"6038","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

KRAS-mutated (KRASmut) cancer cells are highly radioresistance and require higher levels of methionine, an essential amino acid, compared to KRAS wildtype (KRASwt) and normal cells, and diet restriction of methionine has been shown to potentiate the effects of radiation in vivo. We hypothesized that methionine restriction (MR) could radiosensitize KRASmut rectal cancer cells.<br \/><b>Materials\/Methods: <\/b>HCT116 KRASG13D\/+ and SW48 KRASwt colorectal carcinoma isogenic cell lines and their isogenic derivative cell lines HCT 116 KRAS+\/- and SW48 KRASG13D were obtained from Horizon Discovery Ltd (Cambridge, UK). Radiation clonogenic assays, immunofluorescence, and western blot analysis of key DNA damage response proteins were performed in the KRASmut vs. KRASwt colorectal cells treated with ionizing radiation (IR, 2-6 Gy) at increasing time points following pre-treatment with methionine control (MC) (200 &#181;M) or MR (40-fold reduction in methionine, 5 &#181;M) media for 48 hours. One hundred thousand luciferase-expressing KRASwt or KRASmut SW48 cells were implanted orthotopically in the rectum of athymic nude mice. After confirmation of tumor formation at one-week post-injection, the mouse diet was changed to either an MC (0.84% methionine w\/w) or MR (0.12% methionine w\/w) diet for a total of two weeks. Rectal tumors were treated on an Xstrahl small animal radiation research platform (SARRP) to a dose of 25 Gy in 5 daily fractions (1 cm x 1 cm collimator, isocenter at anal verge) during the second week of diet modification. Tumor growth was measured via bioluminescence on IVIS Lumina every two weeks for four weeks post-radiation.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: MR significantly increased radiosensitization compared to MC in both HCT116 and SW48 cells in vitro. KRASmut cells showed a 20-30% increase in radiation in the dose enhancement ratio compared to the KRASwt cells. The protein expression and nuclear foci per cell of the DNA damage marker &#947;H2AX were significantly higher in the KRASmut cells compared to KRASwt cells following 5 Gy of RT at 6 hours. Protein expression of homologous recombination pathway proteins RAD51 and the CtBP interacting protein (CtIP) were higher at baseline in the KRASmut cells than KRASwt. MR substantially reduced the expression of these proteins following RT. Mice harboring SW48 KRASmut rectal tumors treated with 5 Gy x 5 RT and MR showed a significant increase in the complete response rate compared to MC (80% vs. 10%, p=0.02). In the mice harboring SW48 KRASwt rectal tumors, there was no significant difference in response rate between MR vs. MC (40% vs. 30%, p=NS).<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Our study indicates a novel strategy to radiosensitize resistant KRAS-mutated rectal cancer through MR.
