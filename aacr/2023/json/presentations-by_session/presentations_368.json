[{"Abstract":"Treating oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains challenging due to limited knowledge of the critical genes that could affect cell survival in OSCC. We have previously utilized genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout functional screens to explore the genetic vulnerabilities of OSCC and identified Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (<i>ADAR1<\/i>) as one of the top fitness genes. ADAR1 is an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) that catalyses adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which suppresses dsRNA sensing mechanism from triggering cell death. ADAR1 gene encodes for two isoforms, the constitutively expressed P110 and the interferon-inducible P150. Given that deleting ADAR1 severely impacts OSCC viability, we aimed to elucidate key molecular mechanisms underlying this gene dependency which may provide opportunities for developing better treatment strategies. Here, we validated ADAR1 dependency via competitive co-culture assay using single-guide RNA (sgRNA) knockout in selected OSCC cell lines. We also confirmed that sgRNA-mediated ADAR1 knockout resulted in prominent cell lethality through increased apoptosis and inhibition of colony formation. Cell lethality is evident in ADAR1 KO cells in conjunction with the phosphorylation of a dsRNA sensor, protein kinase R (PKR) which regulates cell death mechanism. In ADAR1-less dependent cells, IFN-&#946; treatment increased the expression of ISGs including ADAR1, and sensitized the cells to ADAR1 KO-induced cell death. Overexpression of ADAR1-P150 but not ADAR1-P110 rescued cell lethality in ADAR1-depleted cells, suggesting that ADAR1-P150 is required for OSCC survival. We also demonstrate that the deaminase function of ADAR1 is important in conferring survival to a subset of OSCC lines. In addition to PKR, the melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) dsRNA sensor is also important in mediating ADAR1 KO-induced cell lethality OSCC and co-deleting both PKR and MDA5 enabled the partial rescue of cell death compared to when each gene was knocked out individually. Collectively, our results uncover the essentiality of IFN-inducible ADAR1-P150 for OSCC survival, and reveal that the activation of PKR and MDA5 dsRNA sensing pathways underlie the cell lethality caused by ADAR1 deletion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oral cancers,ADAR1,RNA editing,dsRNA sensing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Pei San Yee<sup>1<\/sup>, Annie Wai Yeeng Chai<sup>1<\/sup>, Shi Mun Yee<sup>1<\/sup>, Shi Yin Ooi<sup>1<\/sup>, Yee Hua Tan<sup>1<\/sup>, Mathew Garnett<sup>2<\/sup>, Siew Kit Ng<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Sok Ching Cheong<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Cancer Research Malaysia, Subang Jaya, Malaysia,<sup>2<\/sup>Wellcome Sanger Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom,<sup>3<\/sup>Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"61184056-0074-45c2-ac71-04d1b5d5a23f","ControlNumber":"4291","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

The Speckle-Type POZ protein (SPOP) mutant subclass of PC accounts for 10% to 15% of all primary PC cases. SPOP is an adaptor for Cullin3\/Ring (CUL3-RING)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes and provides substrate specificity. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) studies show that SPOP is the most frequently mutated gene in primary prostate cancer (PC). Interestingly, PC-associated <i>SPOP<\/i> mutations are always missense and occur in a heterozygous fashion. The current gap in knowledge is the lack of understanding of the role of wildtype SPOP in PC.<br \/>Methods: By utilizing prostate specific SPOP knockout (KO) mice, we recently reported increased levels of AR and MYC protein and increased cellular turnover (both proliferation and apoptosis) in the prostate luminal epithelium compared to wildtype prostates. We now characterized these mice for the expression of Cre protein and SPOP mRNA at different age using immunohistochemistry and RNA in situ hybridization. Furthermore, we performed RNA-sequencing analysis in the SPOP knockout mice and matched control littermates. Moreover, we performed RNA-seq in LNCaP, LNCaP-Abl, and RWPE1 cells following SPOP inhibition via siRNA targeting SPOP. Finally, we compared our SPOP inhibition signature from in vitro cell lines and prostate specific SPOP knockout murine model to gain insights about the role of wildtype SPOP protein in the prostate epithelium.<br \/>Result: Using our Spopfl\/fl;PBCre+ model, we observed <i>SPOP<\/i> floxed cells are rapidly lost and the murine prostate epithelium was repopulated with SPOP<sup> <\/sup>wildtype carrying cells. Similarly, knockdown (KD) of SPOP through siRNA treatment in a panel of PC cell lines resulted in a significant reduction in cell viability. These observations suggest that <i>SPOP<\/i> is important for the normal prostate cell viability. Further transcriptomic profiling of SPOP KO (from transgenic murine model) as well as siSPOP treated in vitro prostate cell lines revealed a significant reduction in the transcriptional activity of the AR.<br \/>Conclusion: Our data illustrate for the first time a critical role for SPOP in the growth and survival of the prostate epithelium and prostate cancer cell. Our findings further validates SPOP as a important therapeutic target for the treatment of prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen receptor,Prostate cancer,Mouse models,Small molecule inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kinza Rizwan<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Darlene Skapura<sup><\/sup>, Cammy Mason<sup><\/sup>, Cristian Coarfa<sup><\/sup>, Nicholas Mitsiades<sup><\/sup>, Damian Young<sup><\/sup>, Salma Kaochar<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0ceb8a45-9a48-4c25-974a-08c765bdf3d3","ControlNumber":"2671","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

Somatic alterations in the NRF2 pathway also contribute to the growth and metastasis of many cancer types including ~30% of lung cancers. Still, the activation of NRF2 has frequently been observed in the absence of known genomic alterations, indicating that other pathways may drive its dysregulation. Further, approaches to target NRF2 pharmacologically have remained elusive. Here, we conducted a screen that identified a small molecule, ML329, exhibiting selective cytotoxicity in cells exhibiting NRF2 dependency and synthetic lethality to NRF2 pathway mutations across 489 cell lines. Surprisingly, we find that melanomas&#8212;which rarely have somatic mutations in the NRF2 pathway&#8212;were commonly sensitive to ML329. Melanomas were seen to exhibit NRF2-dependent metabolomic and transcriptional programs through the transcriptional activation of the adaptor protein p62\/SQSTM1 by the melanocyte master regulator and oncoprotein MITF. This pathway was found to be conserved among all cancers characterized by genomic alterations of the MiT family (MITF, TFEB and TFE3) including subsets of renal cell carcinomas, pediatric sarcomas, and uveal and cutaneous melanomas. Our data identify a previously unrecognized, non-canonical mechanism of NRF2 activation by the MiT family, clarifying the regulation of NRF2 in pathologic and physiologic contexts. Pharmacologic inhibition of NRF2 could be valuable in the treatment of conditions with MITF family dysregulation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Malignant melanoma,Kinase inhibitors,Nrf2,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Xinbo Luo<sup>1<\/sup>, Bart Lutterbach<sup>1<\/sup>, Priya Pancholi<sup>1<\/sup>, Yeon Sook Choi<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiao Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Phillip Munson<sup>3<\/sup>, Saqib Faisal<sup>3<\/sup>, David  A.

Brain tumors show obvious sex biases in incidence and therapy response. Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor, and similar to other brain tumors, males have consistently higher incidence across all subgroups and at all ages. Moreover, for patients &#62;3 years of age, females have significantly better outcomes than males. However, molecular drivers of such sex disparity in incidence and prognosis remain unclear.Here, we report a male-biased function of an oncogene, YAP1, in MB formation and immune suppression. Integrated multi-platform genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and in vivo transcriptional target analyses show that YAP1 promotes cancer stem cell maintenance through concurrent transcriptional activation of stemness genes, such as <i>Sox2,<\/i> and repression of differentiation regulators such as <i>NeuroD1<\/i> and <i>Zic1<\/i>\/2. YAP1 expression in MB cells also inhibits anti-tumor immune cell infiltration by directly regulating <i>Csf1, Igf1, <\/i>and<i> Igfbp3<\/i> transcription and modulating IL6-JAK-STAT3, TNFR1, TGFb, and CCL5 Pathways. Notably, we found that <i>YAP1<\/i> genetic deletion results in disproportionately higher survival of males than females in a spontaneous mouse model of infantile SHH MB, despite equivocal expression levels in both sexes. Consistent with our findings in mouse models, YAP1 downstream genes stratify MB patient survival in males but not females. Finally, we show that a brain-penetrant YAP1 inhibitor, verteporfin, extends survival and enhances immune infiltrates <i>in vivo,<\/i> mimicking the effects of <i>Yap1<\/i> genetic deletion. In summary, this study demonstrates that an oncogene function may be sex-biased and underscores the need to incorporate sex as a variable in cancer mechanisms, tumor immunology, and treatment response studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Medulloblastoma,Yes Associated Protein (YAP1),Immune evasion,Sex disparity ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Nourhan Abdelfattah<sup>1<\/sup>, Sivaraman Natarajan<sup>2<\/sup>, Jose Maldonado<sup>1<\/sup>, Han nhat Tran<sup>1<\/sup>, Hannah Borland<sup>1<\/sup>, Rachael McMinimy<sup>2<\/sup>, Shu-hsia Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Fernando Camargo<sup>3<\/sup>, James Olson<sup>4<\/sup>, Joshy George<sup>5<\/sup>, <b>Kyuson Yun<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>The Jackson Laboratory for Mammalian Genomics, Bar Harbor, ME,<sup>3<\/sup>Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Boston, MA,<sup>4<\/sup>Fred Hutch Cancer Center, Seattle, WA,<sup>5<\/sup>The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Farmington, CT","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6c8a738c-3668-4936-ad7a-362fbc95c970","ControlNumber":"4939","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

Approximately 25% patients with BC will present with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and for the past several decades the standard-of-care for MIBC and metastatic bladder cancer has been cisplatin-based chemotherapy. More recently, multiple immunotherapeutic agents have been approved but only a subset of patients respond to these treatments and therefore novel therapeutic strategies are needed to expand treatment options and improve clinical outcomes for BC patients. Large-scale genomic studies of MIBC have identified numerous recurrent genomic alterations including mutations, copy number alterations, and chromosomal translocations. Using publicly available patient datasets, we identified ~20% of MIBC patients harboring alterations in genes involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and their upstream activators. RAF1 copy number amplification was the most predominant alteration followed by activating HRAS mutations. Leveraging our institutional cohorts of bladder cancer specimens, we defined the frequency of these alterations and validated RAF1 amplification in a subset of cases using fluorescence in situ hybridization. To functionally define the role of MAPK pathway alterations in BC, we tested activity of RAF and MEK inhibitors in BC cell line models with diverse MAPK pathway alterations including RAF1 amplification and HRAS\/NRAS mutations. We found that these MAPK pathway altered models displayed increased sensitivity to RAF\/MEK inhibition compared to MAPK-unaltered models. We further demonstrated the feasibility of preclinically targeting these alterations in mouse models of BC using cell line and patient-derived-xenografts. Additionally, we tested the impact of MAPK pathway modulation on tumor extrinsic properties including changes in the tumor microenvironment that could potentially affect responses to immunotherapeutic agents. Taken together, we have identified MAPK pathway alterations as a novel dependency in BC that can be targeted with emerging RAF inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,Copy number alterations,Bladder cancer,RAF kinase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Raie Bekele<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Amruta Samant<sup>2<\/sup>, Timothy Hanlon<sup>1<\/sup>, Kent Mouw<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Massachusetts, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4eb554bf-7627-43b9-b6f6-37ac82ec5bf2","ControlNumber":"5257","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.

Thus, there is a need to identify key driver signaling molecules that regulate PDAC progression and to target them for therapeutic intervention. Thyroid receptor-interacting protein 13 (TRIP13), an enzyme of the AAA-ATPase family, participates in spindle assembly checkpoints, double-strand DNA repair, and development of drug resistance. Recently, a small-molecule inhibitor of TRIP13, DCZ0415, was evaluated in experimental models of multiple myeloma and colorectal cancer. However, the expression, oncogenic role, and targeting of TRIP13 in PDAC are unknown. Thus, we examined the expression and role of TRIP13 in PDAC and investigated if targeting it with DCZ0415 had an inhibitory effect on phenotypic features, tumor growth, metastasis, and immune modulation.<br \/>Methods: Publicly available cancer OMICS datasets (TCGA and CPTAC) for TRIP13 expression were analyzed by using the UALCAN portal, and results were validated with human PDAC samples. To demonstrate the oncogenic role of TRIP13 in PDAC progression, we used silencing with shRNA or pharmacologic targeting by DCZ0415 and performed MTT, colony formation, wound healing, Transwell, and western blot assays in PDAC cell lines, and assessed tumor growth and metastasis in immunocompromised NSG mice. Immunostaining and western blotting were performed to ascertain the immuno-modulatory mechanism of DCZ0415 in an immunocompetent KPC murine model of PDAC.<br \/>Results: In human PDACs, TRIP13 is overexpressed at the mRNA and protein levels, relative to adjacent normal pancreatic tissues. Silencing of TRIP13 with shRNA or DCZ0415 treatment of PDAC cells reduced their proliferation, migration, and invasion; induced G2\/M cell cycle arrest; and, by modulating Bcl-2 family proteins, increased apoptosis. Furthermore, DCZ0415 treatment or silencing of TRIP13 increased E-cadherin and decreased N-cadherin and vimentin, suggesting its involvement in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process. Genetic manipulation or pharmacologic targeting of TRIP13 also resulted in reduced expression of FGFR4 and pSTAT3, leading to lower levels of &#946;-catenin, cyclin D1, LEF1, and TCF1, indicating inactivation of the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin pathway. In a syngeneic PDCA model, DCZ0415 induced an immune response by increasing granzyme B and perforin and by decreasing PD1. DCZ0415 treatment also facilitated immune cell infiltration, as evident from elevated staining of CD3 and CD4 cells.<br \/>Conclusions: In sum, silencing of TRIP13 or treatment with DCZ0415 reduces PDAC progression by downregulating the FGFR4\/STAT3\/&#946;-catenin pathway. DCZ0415 treatment also enhances anti-tumor immunity. These findings suggest that DCZ0415 can be developed as a therapeutic\/immunostimulatory agent to improve treatment of PDAC patients expressing elevated levels of TRIP13.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Therapeutic target,Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4  (FGFR-4),&#946;-catenin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Farrukh Afaq<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sumit Agarwal<sup>1<\/sup>, Prachi Bajpai<sup>1<\/sup>, Hyung-Gyoon Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Sameer Al Diffalha<sup>1<\/sup>, Shajan P.

However, to date there are no effective treatments that specifically target TP53 gain-of-function (GOF) mutants. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify and target vulnerabilities that perpetuate disease progression and treatment resistance resulting from TP53 GOF mutants.<br \/>Methods: We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics on GEM and PDX CRPC models with or without TP53 GOF mutations. Our findings were validated using genetic and pharmacologic approaches in relevant in vitro and in vivo models. We assessed the effect of L-asparaginase (ASNase) or\/and glutaminase (GLS) inhibitor CB-839 in cell lines, organoids and PDX models. Tumors were characterized by histology and immunohistochemistry for relevant markers.<br \/>Results: Using transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, we show here that TP53-mutated prostate cancer (PCa) exhibits an increased dependency on asparagine and overexpresses asparagine synthetase (ASNS, the enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of asparagine). Mechanistically, TP53 GOF mutations transcriptionally activate ASNS expression, directly as well as via ATF4, driving de novo asparagine biosynthesis to support CRPC growth. TP53-mutated CRPC cells are sensitive to asparagine restriction by knockdown of ASNS and L-asparaginase treatment to deplete the intracellular and extracellular sources of asparagine respectively. This effect was rescued by asparagine addition. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of intracellular asparagine biosynthesis using a glutaminase (GLS) inhibitor and depletion of extracellular asparagine with L-asparaginase significantly reduced asparagine production and effectively impaired CRPC growth.<br \/>Conclusions: This study highlights the significance of ASNS-mediated metabolic adaptation as a synthetic vulnerability in CRPC with TP53 GOF mutations, providing a rationale for co-targeting intracellular and extracellular asparagine production to treat these lethal prostate cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,p53 mutations,Therapy resistance,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Young A Yoo<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e6ee53e7-6c68-4ed7-a1ca-9125cfe5d5c8","ControlNumber":"577","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

However, the role of m1A methylation in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains largely unexplored. TRMT6 is the most critical methyltransferase that catalyzes N1-methyladenine modification within tRNA, and early evidence suggests that this TRMT6-mediated m1A methylation is also required for the self-renewal of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Herein, we systematically interrogated the role of TRMT6 in mediating stemness and pathogenesis of CRC.<br \/>Methods: We first analyzed the expression levels of all m1A regulators in paired tumor and adjacent-normal samples from TCGA and GEO databases. Subsequently, real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting (WB) assays were performed to validate the dysregulation of TRMT6 in CRC tissues and cell lines. m1A dot-blot assays were undertaken to detect methylation levels in CRC tissues and RKO and SW620 CRC cell lines. Cell viability, colony formation, spheroid formation, wound healing, and invasion assays were conducted to investigate the biological functions of TRMT6 in CRC.<br \/>Results: Higher m1A methylation levels were detected in CRC than in normal tissues. By analyzing the expression of ten m1A regulators in public datasets, and subsequent qRT-PCR validation in a CRC clinical cohort, we identified that high TRMT6 expression was significantly associated with advanced tumor stages (III&#38;IV vs. I&#38;II, <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05) and poor prognosis (5-year relapse-free survival rates in high vs. low expression groups: 50.9% vs. 65.1%, <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05). TRMT6 silencing in CRC cell lines inhibited cell growth, colony formation, and metastatic efficiency (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.01-0.001). Furthermore, we discovered that the TRMT6 could enhance stem cell-like properties required for CSC self-renewal. Transcriptomic profiling identified that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway is one of the critical signaling regulators of TRMT6 in CRC. The TRMT6 knockdown resulted in significant inhibition of p-EGFR and p-ERK, but not p-AKT in CRC cell lines (all <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05), which suggested that m1A modification exerts its oncogenic effects in CRC by activating EGFR downstream pathway.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study elucidates for the first time the oncogenic effects of TRMT6 on catalyzing m1A modification through the EGFR\/ERK pathway, which could offer a promising therapeutic strategy in CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,RNA modification,TRMT6,therapeutic strategy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>SILEI SUI<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, CAIMING XU<sup>1<\/sup>, Ying Qing<sup>2<\/sup>, Hideo Baba<sup>3<\/sup>, Ajay Goel<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Molecular Diagnostics and Experimental Therapeutics, Beckman Research Institute of The City of Hope, Monrovia, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute of The City of Hope, Monrovia, CA,<sup>3<\/sup>Gastroenterological Surgery, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"32cbdad3-0ecd-44ef-8b63-98d64076f0ab","ControlNumber":"3669","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Mutations in SOS1 are found in 3-5% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), colorectal cancers (CRC) and melanomas. The recent development of novel SOS1 inhibitors, including BI-3406 and BI-1701963, that block interaction between SOS1 and RAS, presents a potential therapy for SOS1-driven cancers. Here we show that the majority of SOS1 mutations observed in patients enhance RAS guanine nucleotide exchange in cells and activate RAS-MAPK signaling. Of the 11 available SOS1-mutant cancer cell lines without RAS co-mutation, 10 were sensitive to SOS1 inhibition in 2D and\/or 3D cell culture, while cells with SOS1 and RAS co-mutations were resistant to SOS1 inhibition. Treatment with a SHP2 inhibitor, which is presumed to inhibit the activity of both SOS1 and SOS2, revealed a subset of SOS1-mutant cell lines that were more sensitive to SHP2 inhibition than SOS1 inhibition. This implied that, in certain settings, SOS2 can compensate for the loss of SOS1 activity. Accordingly, these cells exhibited a rebound in RAS signaling after treatment with SOS1i that was dependent on SOS2. SOS2 knock-down further sensitized these cells to SOS1 inhibition, resulting in responses equivalent to SHP2 inhibition. In addition, we show that, as with SOS1, SOS2 is a target for ERK1\/2-dependent feedback phosphorylation. Thus, relief of ERK1\/2-dependent negative regulation of SOS2, following SOS1 inhibition, likely contributes to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-SOS2 activation that may mediate SOS1 inhibitor resistance in some contexts. In vivo, SOS1i inhibited tumor growth in xenograft models of SOS1-mutant AML and NSCLC. Tumor-suppressive effects of SOS1i in these models were comparable to or stronger than the effects of SHP2i or MEKi. Thus, our results suggest that SOS1 inhibition could be an effective therapeutic approach in RAS wild-type cancer patients with SOS1 mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,Therapeutics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Matthew  J.

The majority of p53 mutations are missense mutations resulting in the expression of full-length p53 with inactive tumor suppressor function. Small molecule corrector drugs that change the mutant p53 conformation to a wild-type-like structure are attractive goals for personalized, targeted cancer therapies. Our previous work has shown that restoring p53 activities represses cancer cells and tumor growth <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo.<\/i> This and other work suggest that reactivation of p53 could have therapeutic potential for cancer patients with mutated p53. This study aims to investigate a new potential p53 corrector small molecule, UCI-1001. Our data suggest that treatment of p53 mutant cancer cell lines with compounds of the UCI-1001 series inhibits cell growth in a p53 mutant-dependent manner and induces some p53-wild-type like activities such as mutant p53 DNA binding, transcriptional activation of p53 target genes, and induction of cell death. Utilizing the cellular thermal shift assay, CETSA, we show that UCI-1001 binds mutant p53 <i>in vivo<\/i> and changes mutant p53 conformation to a wild-type-like structure. Taken together, these preliminary results suggest the UCI-1001 series is a promising candidate for the development of p53 corrector drugs, but further development of pharmacokinetic properties will be necessary for translation to the bedside.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p53,p53 mutations,Cancer,Tumor suppressor gene,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maryam Mohammed J Fallatah<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Özlem Demir<sup>2<\/sup>, Rommie Amaro<sup>2<\/sup>, Peter Kaiser<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Biological Chemistry, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1f9e461a-3dbf-44e8-9362-a77aa5cbe394","ControlNumber":"2920","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

To date, only treatment targeting KRAS<sup>G12C <\/sup>mutation have been successful in the clinic and approved. However, it is hampered by adaptive resistance, mainly associated with the emergence of other KRAS mutations and high amplification of KRAS<sup>G12C <\/sup>allele. We have developed a new potent strategy combining gene editing with a tumor selective nanocarrier, to impair cancer cell proliferation by directly targeting G12D, G12V,and G12C mutations of the <i>KRAS <\/i>oncogene. ADGN-121, ADGN-122 and ADGN-123 are gene-editing complexes containing proprietary sgRNA targeting KRAS<i><sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i>, KRAS<i><sup>G12V<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup> or KRAS<i><sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i> with mRNA<sub>Cas9<\/sub> complexed with proprietary short amphipathic peptides that form stable neutral nanoparticles. The complexes were evaluated on pancreas, colorectal and lung cancer cells harboring KRAS<i><sup>G12D, V, or C<\/sup><\/i> mutations. KRAS mutant indel frequency was evaluated by T7E1 method. <i>In-vivo<\/i> efficacy of IV-administered ADGN\/mRNA<sub>Cas9<\/sub>gRNA (0.25-1.0mg\/kg, 2 injections at day 1 &#38; 7) was evaluated in Panc1 (KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>) and SW403 (KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup>) mouse xenografts. ADGN-123 in combination with AMG-510 (KRAS<i><sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i> inhibitor) was evaluated on H358, PACA2 and SW837 cells, exhibiting an acquired resistance to AMG-510. ADGN-121,-122 and -123 efficiently and selectively silenced KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>, KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup> KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup><sub>, <\/sub> respectively, in colorectal, pancreatic and lung cancer cells resulting in reduction of cell proliferation by 80% and inhibition of ERK and\/or AKT phosphorylation. Only two IV-administrations of ADGN-121 containing gRNA<sup>G12D <\/sup>abolished Panc1 tumor growth in a dose dependent manner, resulting in tumor regression of 60-70% at 1.0mg\/kg. ADGN-122 containing gRNA<sup>G12V<\/sup> abolished SW403 tumor growth with a tumor regression of 70% at 1.0 mg\/kg. In contrast, no effect on tumor growth was observed with nonspecific gRNA. The combinations of ADGNs with drugs currently used on clinic have been evaluated. We demonstrated a synergistic combination ADGN-121\/Abraxane in pancreatic carcinoma and ADGN-122\/Capecitabine in colon Adenocarcinoma. We showed, that ADGN-123 containing gRNA<sup>G12C <\/sup>can effectively reduce the proliferation and inhibit ERK and AKT phosphorylation of AMG-510 acquired resistance cells and that no resistance occurs after ADGN-123 treatment. ADGN treatments are well tolerated, no sign of clinical toxicity, inflammatory response or emergence of other KRAS mutation was detected after single or repeated administrations. ADGNs were effective in targeting selectively mutated KRAS both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Our study provides a proof-of-concept that ADGN can be applied to target driver mutations of cancers <i>in vivo<\/i> and permanently disrupt the oncogenic alleles, leading to major tumor regression. ADGN-123 can be used as a strategy to overcome resistance associated to small molecule inhibitors of KRAS<i><sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Gene silencing,Resistance,Anticancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Gilles Divita<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Veronica Guzman-Gonzales<sup>1<\/sup>, Audrey Grunenberger<sup>1<\/sup>, Elodie Czuba<sup>1<\/sup>, Melanie Guidetti<sup>2<\/sup>, Veronique Josserand<sup>2<\/sup>, Neil Desai<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>DIVINCELL, Nimes, France,<sup>2<\/sup>IAB, Grenoble, France,<sup>3<\/sup>AADIGEN LLC, PAcific Palissades, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1afcb83d-9716-4821-80a7-aab12bdee670","ControlNumber":"7537","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;G.

Epidemiologic data suggest estrogen may decrease brain tumor growth. The lack of powerful, selective brain permeable estrogen receptor beta (ER&#946;) ligands to promote its anticancer action is limiting the therapeutic promise of ER&#946;. The goal of this project is to create a new class of brain permeable ER&#946; agonists for the treatment of GBM.<br \/><b>Method<\/b>: We have used four different assays to identify potent leads. (1) ER&#946; and estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#945;) reporter assays, (2) Polar Screen Estrogen Receptor (ER) Competitive Binding Assays, (3) Cell viability assays using GBM cells, and (4) Activity in WT and ER&#946;-KO GBM cells. CellTiter-Glo Cell Viability and colony formation assays were used to test the efficacy of ER&#946; agonists. Invasion was measured by matrigel invasion chamber assays and apoptosis was measured by Caspase-Glo&#174; 3\/7 and Annexin V assays. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the cell cycle. Western blotting, RNA-Seq, RT-qPCR, and ER&#946; KO cells were used in the mechanistic studies. Both orthotopic patient-derived xenografts and GBM cell line-derived (CDX) xenografts were used to test the ER&#946; agonist's activity in vivo.<br \/><b> Results<\/b>: Indanone and tetralone-oximes or keto-oximes have been hypothesized, produced, and evaluated as new ER agonists. Due to its high action in ER&#946; reporter assays, specific binding to ER&#946; in polar screen assays (EC50 91 nM), and potent growth inhibitory activity (IC50 7.4) in GBM cells, CIDD-97 was discovered as a possible hit by screening a library of ~60 compounds. CIDD-97 is significantly more selective for ER&#946; than ER&#945; (40-fold). Treatment with CIDD-97 markedly reduced U251 cell viability while having little to no effect on U251-ER-KO cells and normal human astrocytes. Further, CIDD-97 treatment decreased the expression of stemness markers in patient derived GSC lines and promoted apoptosis. Additionally, CIDD-ER&#946; agonist improved TMZ's ability to reduce GBM cell survival. The activation of ER&#946; target genes in cells treated with CIDD-97 was verified by using RNA-Seq and RTqPCR. PK studies confirmed that CIDD-0149897 has systemic exposure, was found in the brain, and its maximal detectable levels suggested that it has good BBB permeability. Mice tolerated daily intraperitoneal treatment of CIDD-0149897 (50 mg\/kg) with a 7-day repeat dosage with no evidence of toxicity. Additionally, when compared to vehicle CIDD-97 (50 mg\/kg\/i.p.) treatment significantly decreased tumor growth in xenograft models and extended the survival of tumor-bearing mice in orthotopic GSC models.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Collectively, these findings pointed to CIDD-97 as a possible ER&#946; agonist and is easily adaptable to clinical use alongside current chemo- and radiation-therapy regimens, offering GBM patients an additional means of improving survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Estrogen receptor &#946;,Glioblastoma multiforme,Agonist,Survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Uday  P.

It is also characterized as a tumor suppressor gene mutated in up to 80% clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cases. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has shown improved ccRCC treatment outcomes. However, the biological roles of the <i>VHL<\/i> gene in ICB therapy are to be explored.<br \/>Methods: The association between <i>VHL<\/i> gene mutation and overall survival of patients receiving ICB treatments was determined by integrating multiple human datasets. CRISPR\/Cas9 was used to generate <i>VHL<\/i> knockout (KO) for in vivo tumor growth and in vitro mechanistic studies. The anti-tumor responses of genetic VHL loss in combination with anti-PD1 treatment were evaluated in three syngeneic murine tumor models. Tumor infiltrated lymphocytes and intratumoral T-cell receptor (TCR) diversity were analyzed by flow cytometry and TCR sequencing, respectively. Mitochondrial defects resulted from <i>VHL<\/i> loss were tested by JC-1 mitochondrial membrane potential assay, immunofluorescence microscopy, and qRT-PCR. <i>VHL<\/i> loss-mediated downstream signaling were further examined by western blot and bulk RNA sequencing.<br \/>Results: The substantial overall survival benefits among ICB-treated patients with<i>VHL<\/i> mutations across different cancers, including RCC, in multiple human cohorts. Genetic knockout of <i>VHL<\/i> enhanced anti-PD1 therapy in three murine tumor models, including those of non-RCC origins. Moreover, <i>VHL<\/i> loss caused significant infiltration of immune effector cells and increased diversity of intratumoral TCR repertoire. <i>VHL<\/i> deficiency resulted in HIF&#945; accumulation, increased expression of pro-mitophagy factor BNIP3, and impaired mitochondrial membrane potential that led to the cytoplasmic leakage of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), triggering cGAS-STING activation and type I interferon production. <i>HIF<\/i><i>&#945;<\/i> overexpression showed similar results as demonstrated in <i>VHL<\/i>-KO cells. In contrast, double knockdown of <i>VHL<\/i> and <i>HIF<\/i><i>&#945;<\/i> reversed <i>VHL-<\/i>loss induced BNIP3 upregulation, rescued mtDNA leakage to the cytoplasm, and disrupted constitutive activation of cGAS-STING signaling. Furthermore, blocking type I interferon signaling abrogated <i>VHL<\/i>-deficiency induced tumor suppression.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study uncovered a novel role for <i>VHL<\/i> loss in creating an immunogenic tumor microenvironment through the activation of mtDNA-cGAS-STING pathway and type I interferon signaling in tumor cells via VHL-HIF&#945;-BNIP3 axis, making them susceptible to ICB therapy. This finding provides a mechanistic explanation for ccRCC responsiveness to ICB therapy despite a moderate tumor mutation burden and suggests potential therapeutic strategies targeting ccRCC and other <i>VHL-<\/i>deficient tumors based on constitutive cGAS-STING and type I interferon activation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor suppressor gene,Immune checkpoint blockade,Interferons,Mitochondrial DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Meng Jiao<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Xuhui Bao<sup>1<\/sup>, Mengjie Hu<sup>1<\/sup>, Dong Pan<sup>1<\/sup>, Jonathan Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Xinjian Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Fang Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Chuan-Yuan Li<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC,<sup>2<\/sup>Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangdong, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8eeadc58-ef80-4aa1-b3e6-c53b90d3c07e","ControlNumber":"4089","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

TNBCs are also more prone to the development of chemoresistance and metastatic progression, which are the main obstacles to reducing TNBC-related mortality. The objective of this study is to identify targetable key node (s) that contribute to the development of chemoresistance in TNBC.<br \/><b>Method<\/b>: Differentially expressed genes in TNBC patients with or without relapse were analyzed to select functionally important genes in chemoresistant TNBC. TRIM29 was selected based on survival analysis. Carboplatin-resistant TNBC cells were established to explore the phenotypic and molecular differences.

The breast tumor xenograft model revealed that TRIM29-KO in chemoresistant TNBC formed significantly less dense tumor in mice compared to control. Mechanistically, an enhanced expression of &#946;-catenin was seen in chemoresistant as well as TRIM29-overexpressing cells.

Thus, more effective therapies are needed to reduce the high mortality rates associated with metastatic TNBC and HER2-enriched breast cancer. The Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2)-Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway is dysregulated in multiple solid tumors, including breast cancer, and is being investigated as a therapeutic target. Similarly, Tropomyosin receptor tyrosine kinase A (TrkA) is an emerging target in metastatic breast cancers. The prevalence of aberrant JAK2 or TrkA signaling led to the development and FDA approval of orally active, selective inhibitors for JAK2 (pacritinib) and TrkA (entrectinib, larotrectinib). However, breast cancer patients receiving either JAK2 or TrkA inhibitors showed suboptimal clinical response, suggesting that oncogenic signaling events are sustained in the absence of either JAK2 or TrkA activity. In support of this paradigm, we previously reported a novel signaling crosstalk between the JAK2-STAT3 and TrkA pathways (Cancers, 10:2340-2360, 2021). We found that JAK2 and TrkA are preferentially co-activated in TNBC and HER2-enriched breast cancer, and both kinases converge to phosphorylate STAT3 to drive gene transcription and enhance breast cancer cell stemness. The observed significant functional crosstalk between JAK2 and TrkA pathways suggest that co-inhibition of these pathways would greatly benefit breast cancer patients with co-activation of these pathways. In this study, we aimed to determine the therapeutic utility of dual targeting JAK2 and TrkA in TNBC and HER2-enriched breast cancer using FDA-approved selective inhibitors. Our data showed that JAK2 and TrkA inhibitors synergize to reduce breast cancer cell viability in vitro. Our study further revealed that co-inhibition of JAK2 and TrkA potently inhibits breast cancer cell stemness since co-inhibition of these kinases significantly reduces the CD44<sup>high<\/sup>\/CD24<sup>low <\/sup>cell population, mammosphere formation, and ALDH activity to a greater extent than vehicle or monotherapies. We also found that co-inhibition of JAK2 and TrkA more effectively induces apoptosis of breast cancer cells, as indicated by Annexin V flow cytometry, Western blot analysis for cleaved PARP, and Caspase 3\/7 activity. Importantly, our in vivo studies showed that co-inhibition of JAK2 and TrkA significantly delays mammary tumor growth using cell line-derived and patient-derived xenograft breast cancer mouse models. Taken together, our data illustrates the therapeutic utility of dual targeting JAK2 and TrkA in metastatic TNBC and HER2-enriched breast cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Cancer stem cells,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Angelina  T.

The early development of Erlotinib for non-small cell lung cancer paved the way for EGFR treatment, irrespective of tumor indication subtype. And the more recent launch of Sotorasib for <i>KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i> mutation has marked a turning point for the once undruggable mutation. The advent of gene specific-treatments requires a reconfiguration of preclinical models which more effectively represent the said mutation in populations of diverse backgrounds and tumor indications. 3D models which have the ability to recreate the key hallmarks of cancer - such as growth, invasion, immune infiltration and suppression, stromal transformation, drug diffusion, as well as gene mutational signatures - are of exceptional interest to drive rapid and scalable compound efficacy screening. Here, we developed four 3D <i>in vitro<\/i> tumor panels carrying mutations in one of the following genes - KRAS, EGFR, BRCA1, and BRAF - as well as wildtype models for comparison. The tumors were grown in a hydrogel matrix in 96-well plates with stromal fibroblasts and screened with the standard of care (e.g. Sotorasib for <i>KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i>, Erlotinib for <i>EGFR<sup>mut<\/sup><\/i>, the PARP inhibitor Olaparib for <i>BRCA<sup>mut<\/sup><\/i>, and Vemurafenib for <i>BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup><\/i>) and other known therapeutic compounds that target their respective mutations. The utility of a 3D hydrogel matrix and fibroblasts in the panels&#8217; models were key in recreating the stromal compartment of the tumor microenvironment. Endpoints were determined within four days of treatment, including tumor size reduction and tumor killing, via high-content image analysis. The Panels&#8217; robustness as demonstrated by the reproducible results in independent experiments suggests they can be utilized at <i>in vitro<\/i> pharmacology stages and earlier in Hit and Lead finding screens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"3D models,Oncogene,KRAS,BRAF,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Bin Xue<sup>1<\/sup>, Julia Schüler<sup>2<\/sup>, Christopher Harrod<sup>1<\/sup>, Zoji Bomya<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Kolin  C.

Therefore, the identification of novel therapeutic strategies targeting mCRPC is urgent. RB1 deficiency is a common genetic event and contributes to the development of therapy resistance and poor prognosis in prostate cancer. However, effective therapies against RB1-deficient lethal prostate cancer remain elusive. Here we determined how RB1 regulates the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, and whether we can exploit ferroptosis for the treatment of RB1 deficient lethal prostate cancer.<br \/>Methods: To determine how RB1 regulates ferroptosis in prostate cancer, we generated RB1 stable knockdown prostate cancer cell lines using lentivirus-delivered shRNAs. We compared cellular sensitivity to ferroptosis and associated lipid peroxidation between control and RB1 stable knockdown prostate cancer cells. Using western blotting, qPCR, and ChIP analyses, we examined the regulation of ferroptosis by RB1. We also evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of ferroptosis inducers in cell-derived xenograft, patient-derived xenograft, and genetically engineered mouse models.<br \/>Results: Our studies revealed that RB1 deficiency sensitizes prostate cancer cells to ferroptosis. Mechanistically, we found that the E2F family of transcription factors directly binds and activates the ACSL4 promoter and that RB1 inhibits ferroptosis by suppressing E2F-mediated ACSL4 transcriptional activation. More importantly, our preclinical studies demonstrated that induction of ferroptosis by JKE-1674, a recently discovered ferroptosis inducer, significantly blocks RB1 deficient prostate tumor growth and metastasis, and improves the overall survival of mice in the absence of obvious toxicity.<br \/>Conclusions:<br \/>Our findings uncover an RB1\/E2F\/ACSL4 molecular axis that governs ferroptosis and also suggest a new approach to the treatment of RB1-deficient lethal prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Retinoblastoma protein,Prostate cancer,E2F,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mu-En Wang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jiaqi Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Yi Lu<sup>1<\/sup>, Jinjin Wy<sup>1<\/sup>, Jianhong Ou<sup>3<\/sup>, John Asara<sup>4<\/sup>, Andrew Armstrong<sup>5<\/sup>, Qianben Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Lei Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Yuzhuo Wang<sup>6<\/sup>, Jiaoti Huang<sup>1<\/sup>, Ming Chen<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Pathology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC,<sup>2<\/sup>Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Regeneration Center, Duke University, Durham, NC,<sup>4<\/sup>Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA,<sup>5<\/sup>Medicine, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC,<sup>6<\/sup>Urologic Sciences, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4f0cd3b7-ee50-4f5a-8011-d3a4909bc1b6","ControlNumber":"2993","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

The activation of KRAS protein is regulated via switching the cycle between the active form, guanosine- 5&#8242;-triphosphate (GTP)-bound state and the inactive form, guanosine-5&#8242;-diphosphate (GDP)-bound form. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEF), including SOS1\/2 play a key role in catalyzing the transformation of KRAS from GDP to GTP form. In tumors with dysregulation of the MAPK signal axis, inhibition of SOS1\/2 leads to abrogation of the Kras-mediated activation of downstream signals. However, double depletion of SOS1\/2 is embryo lethal, and selective inhibition of SOS1 provides a more balanced therapy for <i>Kras<\/i> mutant tumors. Here we reported SCR-8388 as a highly potent and SOS1- specific inhibitor that effectively inhibited multiple <i>Kras<\/i>-mutant oncoproteins. SCR-8388 was potently bound to SOS1 and blocked the interaction of KRASG12D-GDP or KRASG12C-GDP with IC<sub>50 <\/sub>at single-digit nanomolar level. In contrast, SCR-8388 had no effect on the interaction of KRASG12C-GDP and SOS2. In H358 (KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>) cells, SCR-8388 strongly inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1\/2 with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 20 nM. The anti-proliferation activities of SCR-8388 on Kras mutant tumor cell lines were determined using the anchorage-independent three-dimensional (3-D) growth assay. The results showed that SCR-8388 strongly inhibited cell growth in five <i>Kras<\/i>-mutant cell lines which represent the different <i>Kras<\/i> mutation genotypes, including G12D, G12C, G12S and G13D mutants, the IC50s ranged from 17 to 120 nM, suggesting the broad activities of SOS1 inhibitor against pan-Kras mutation. In contrast, SCR-8388 (at 1 &#181;M) showed no growth inhibition on two <i>Kras <\/i>non-addicted<i> <\/i>cancer cell lines, NCI-H520 and A375. Additionally, SCR-8388 demonstrated enhanced antiproliferation activity in a SOS2 knockout cell line (H358<sup>SOS2-\/-<\/sup>) in comparison with the parental cells, indicating the high selectivity of SCR-8388 over SOS2. SCR-8388 displayed favorable PK properties, and higher tissue exposure, making SCR-8388 achieve effective tumor growth inhibition. In a subcutaneous MIA PaCa-2 xenograft model, oral administration of SCR-8388 resulted in superior tumor growth control in comparison with the clinical reference. Moreover, the robust anti-tumor efficacy was further observed in another KRAS<sup>G13D<\/sup>-mutated DLD-1 xenograft model. Furthermore, SCR-8388 exhibited synergistic anti-tumor activity in combination with several MAPK pathway inhibitors, including KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>, MEK, and ERK inhibitors as excepted. Notably, SCR-8388 demonstrated synergistic effects with the anti-EGFR antibody (cetuximab) both in <i>Kras<\/i>-mutant and WT cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i> and in <i>vivo<\/i>.

In KRAS-mutant cells, KRAS protein exists predominantly in an active, GTP-bound state, leading to excessive oncogenic signaling via RAF\/MEK\/ERK and other effector pathways. After decades of anticipation, the first therapeutic inhibitors of this oncoprotein target a specific mutant allele (KRAS<i><sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i>) and have shown promising results in this rare subset of human PDAC patients (1-2% of cases). While these encouraging clinical results bolster support for targeting RAS in human PDAC, most patients harbor KRAS<i><sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i> and KRAS<i><sup>G12V<\/sup> <\/i>mutations and remain unserved by targeted therapies. Here we report preclinical studies of RM-042, a first-in-class, potent, oral, small molecule inhibitor of GTP-bound RAS proteins, designed to treat cancers driven by a variety of RAS mutations. RMC-6236, a clinical candidate and RM-042, a tool compound, both act through non-covalent binding to an abundant intracellular chaperone protein, cyclophilin A (CypA), resulting in a binary complex that engages GTP-bound RAS to form a high-affinity, RAS-selective tri-complex that sterically inhibits RAS binding to effectors.We examined the anti-tumor activity of RM-042 in two complementary preclinical model systems of PDAC. Using primary human PDAC explant cultures, we found that RM-042 potently inhibits phospho-ERK expression (a marker of KRAS\/RAF\/MEK pathway activity), in a concentration-dependent manner and was associated with reduced viability and altered stromal content. Pilot short-term studies in the K-ras<sup>LSL.G12D\/+<\/sup>, p53<sup>LSL.R172H\/+<\/sup>, Pdx1Cre<sup>tg\/+<\/sup> (KPC) mouse model of PDAC found that RM-042 induced initial tumor stabilizations and regressions associated with loss of pERK expression, in association with increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation, at tolerated doses. However, tumors collected at endpoints showed re-established pERK expression, suggesting activation of resistance\/adaptation mechanisms. Ongoing studies will determine pharmacokinetic properties of RM-042 in the autochthonous PDAC mouse model, as well as the duration of tumor responses and evaluate a potential survival benefit provided by RM-042. Regulatory network analysis of single cell RNA sequencing performed on these tumors at multiple timepoints will provide a mechanistic understanding of the regulatory proteins that drive responses in each cell type in the tumors. Through this approach, we will assess the regulatory adaptations that occur as tumors initially respond and as they escape. Together, these studies provide complementary evidence from <i>in vivo<\/i> murine and <i>ex vivo<\/i> human models for promising anti-tumor activity in response to GTP-RAS inhibition, supporting the inclusion of PDAC patients in ongoing and future clinical trials of RMC-6236.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,KRAS,Inhibitors,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Urszula  N.

Loss of <i>NF1<\/i> is also a prognostic indicator for increased cancer risk at an earlier age, poorer outcomes, and therapeutic resistance. NF1 has recently been shown to bind the estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and act as a transcriptional corepressor. This helps explain findings in ER+ BC. Changes to NF1 that abrogate ER signaling thereby lead to Ras driven tumor resistance to endocrine therapy as cells are able to grow in low levels of E2 (and tamoxifen). Hence, NF1-mutant tumors represent a distinct molecular class in need of new therapeutics targeting both Ras and ER pathways. We have generated preclinical mammalian models of <i>NF1<\/i> loss and BC that can be used to evaluate the role of NF1\/ER transcriptional signaling in BC, the role of immune cells in BC, and therapeutics. Our models include a pathogenic patient missense allele c.3827G&#62;A, p.R1276Q (knockin or KI) as well as a 14 base pair deletion c.3661_3674del, p.P1220fs*1223 (knockout or KO) model. Heterozygous (het) <i>Nf1<\/i> female rats develop mammary gland adenocarcinoma spontaneously, but het KO rats develop multiple tumors with earlier onset. Tumors are generally Grade 2 and do not differ by genotype. By 16 weeks, 70% of KO females have developed at least one tumor whereas only 20% of KI rats and 2% of WT rats have developed tumors. This impacts survival as 76% of KI and 58% of KO females survive to one year. By 2 years, both alleles have 54% survival. The divergence in phenotype between KI and KO alleles may be due to residual function of R1276Q missense NF1 protein. A more in-depth analysis indicates that mammary tumor formation likely begins relatively early, as we find evidence of aberrant morphology and hyperplasia prior to the formation of palpable tumors. Interestingly, we find histological evidence of lung metastases and expression of breast markers GCDFP15, MGA, and CEA in the lung. Again, we see allele-specific effects in that KO rats develop lung tumors earlier than KI rats. Using single nuclei RNASeq to characterize the transcriptional profile of the mammary tumors, we find allele-specific effects beyond repression of Ras activity that drive aggressive tumor development. We identified different tumor cell populations (2 epithelial cell populations, Myeloid cells, B cells, T cells, Basal mammary cells, and WT specific cells) and identified different pathways altered due to the loss of Nf1 including Ephrin B signaling, Cyclin and Cell Cycle signaling, and Glycolysis signaling. Our overall goal is to characterize the phenotype of these rat models in terms of histopathology, Ras signaling, hormone signaling, immune components, and targeted drug response; which can then be compared with what is known regarding patients with somatic or germline inactivation of <i>NF1<\/i> and breast cancer. Ultimately, this will provide better prognostic predictions for patients and better therapeutic options.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras oncogene,Estrogen receptor,Breast cancer,Animal models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Deeann Wallis<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Christian Fay<sup>1<\/sup>, Kelley Bradley<sup>2<\/sup>, Erik Westin<sup>2<\/sup>, William Bradley<sup>1<\/sup>, Hui Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, David Crossman<sup>1<\/sup>, Jeremy  B.

We have identified several cancer-associated post-translational modifications in the DLC1 protein that decrease its tumor suppressor activity and are exploring the upstream mechanisms that regulate the changes as well as the therapeutic potential of reactivating the tumor suppressor activity of DLC1 by inhibiting the post-translational changes. We have made the unexpected observation that lung cancer expresses increased levels of EZH2 in the cytoplasm, where it can methylate DLC1, which can trigger the ubiquitin-proteasomal-dependent degradation of DLC1. The cytoplasmic EZH2 is derived from the nucleus, and inhibition of the CRM1 nuclear export protein or the EZH2 methyl transferase activity can drastically reduce the level of cytoplasmic EZH2 or its activity, which increases the half-life and steady-state level of DLC1 protein several fold. The stabilized DLC1 protein can be reactivated by inhibiting the AKT and SRC kinases, whose phosphorylation of DLC1 can attenuate its tumor suppressor function. A three-drug combination of an EZH2 or a CRM1 inhibitor, together with AKT and SRC kinase inhibitors, can greatly reduce the weight of tumor xenografts from human lung cancer cell lines and induce markers of apoptosis and senescence. Remarkably, isogenic knock-out of DLC1 abolishes most of the anti-tumor activity, implying that DLC1 is the main target of the three-drug treatment, although each inhibitor has many other targets. In addition, we have found that inhibiting endogenous mutant KRAS in the lung cancer lines can phenocopy the CRM1 inhibitor, leading to loss of cytoplasmic EZH2 and increasing the level of DLC1 protein. Conversely, mutant KRAS increases the level of cytoplasmic EZH2 and decreases DLC1. We have investigated the underlying mechanism, and have determined that mutant KRAS regulates nucleocytoplasmic protein shuttling by forming a previously unidentified complex with RAN-GAP (present in primary human tumors and cell lines), which regulates the RAN GTPase, a protein that is required for other proteins to shuttle from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Formation of the RAS\/RAN-GAP complex and its downstream consequences are independent of known RAS signaling from the plasma membrane, as inhibition of MAPK and PI3K does not affect this process. However, efficient complex formation does depend on farnesylation of RAS, as farnesylation-deficient mutants form the complex less efficiently and have reduced consequences for EZH2 and DLC1. Thus, we have identified nucleocytoplasmic protein shuttling as a new function for mutant KRAS and have determined the mechanism depends on complex formation between KRAS and RAN-GAP.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor suppressor,Nuclear-cytoplasmic transport,KRAS,post-translational regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Brajendra Tripathi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nicole Hirsh<sup>1<\/sup>, David Hansen<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaolan Qian<sup>1<\/sup>, Dunrui Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Marian  E.

FAF1 is a genuine exosome cargo and, therefore, loaded into exosomes without additional engineering. FAF1 is a tumor suppressive protein with multifunctional roles including death-promotion (both apoptosis and necrosis), cell cycle arrest, anti-inflammation, and anti-angiogenesis. FAF1 also inhibits metastasis via inhibition of TGF-&#946; pathway. Moreover, FAF1 elicits low expression profiles in several types of cancer. Therefore, this study examined whether exosomal delivery of FAF1 is a plausible strategy for anti-tumor therapeutics.<br \/>Methods: Stable suspension cells originated from HEK293 cells inducibly overexpressing FAF1 were screened using Tet on-off system to avoid cell death due to continuous FAF1 expression. FAF1 was overexpressed by Doxycycline induction and the amounts of FAF1 loaded on exosomes were normalized by exosome markers. The efficacy of exosomal FAF1 was evaluated in mouse xenograft models implanted with various human carcinoma cells.<br \/>Results: Cell lines showing FAF1 expression with more than 3 fold of control cells were picked. Among FAF1-overexpressing cells, F5-3 cell line showing highest expression of exosomal FAF1 (showing 23 fold of FAF1 loading efficiency compared to parental cells) was used for exosomal source for <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments. Furthermore, F5-3 produced about 70 times of exosomal FAF1 when compared to that of HEK293 cell in the same volume of culture medium. The exosomal FAF1 produced in F5-3 cells inhibited tumor growth in various cancer types including lung, breast, liver, and pancreas in mouse xenograft models. In addition, exosomal FAF1 consistently demonstrated superior tumor-suppressive potential to soluble FAF1 in all tumors investigated in this study. Also, there were no serious side effects based on weight changes.<br \/>Conclusion: This study demonstrated the tumor-suppressive potential of exosomal FAF1, demonstrating the feasibility of exosomal delivery of FAF1 as an efficient therapeutic measure. Furthermore, the selective and massive production properties of F5-3 cell realizes efficient and scalable production of exosomal FAF1.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Exosomes,FAF1,Genuine cargo,Anticancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jeong-Hoon Han<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, DaeHo Park<sup>1<\/sup>, Bumjun Jung<sup>1<\/sup>, Hyeong-Gwon Yoo<sup>2<\/sup>, Kyung-Ok Cho<sup>1<\/sup>, Eunhee Kim<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Kainos Medicine, Inc., Seongnam-si, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4752b961-45e0-4bad-a96e-fd314d23f131","ControlNumber":"541","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

The upregulation of KIF11, a motor protein that regulates cell mitosis, has been associated with the aggressive proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells. A molecular strategy to counteract the hyperactivity of KIF11 may represent a potential means to treat PDAC. We previously identified MG53, a member of the tripartite motif family protein (TRIM72), as an important component of tissue repair, and revealed its potential application in regenerative medicine. So far, most published studies have focused on the cytosolic and vesicle-trafficking function of MG53, little is known on the nuclear action of MG53 in pancreatic tumor suppression. In the present study, our confocal imaging revealed frequent appearance of MG53 in the nucleus of human pancreatic cancer cells, and subcellular fractionation assay showed that a majority of MG53 protein was present in the nuclear fraction. Decreased MG53 and increased KIF11 protein expression were observed in both pancreatic cancer cell lines (PANC-1 and mPanc96) and PDAC tissue from surgically resected tumors. Overexpressing MG53 inhibited colony formation and proliferation of PANC-1 cells with significant reduction of KIF11 expression. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MG53-mediated control of KIF11 expression occurs at the gene transcription level. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated an interaction between MG53 and the promoter of KIF11 in PANC-1 cells. Using a luciferase cell reporter driven by the KIF11 promoter, we found that overexpressing MG53 led to downregulation of the KIF11 transcription activity, and induced cell cycle arrest at the G2\/M phase. We also conducted syngeneic orthotopic transplantation of a mouse pancreatic cancer cell line, KPC cells derived from pancreatic tumor in<i> KRas<sup>G12D<\/sup>\/Trp53<sup>-\/-<\/sup>\/Pdx-1-Cre<\/i> (KPC) mice, into the pancreas of wild type (WT) and<i> mg53-\/-<\/i> (MG53-KO) mice, which showed aggressive pancreatic tumor growth in MG53-KO mice compared with WT mice after 3-week of transplantation. Western blots revealed that a considerable amount of MG53 protein was found in the pancreatic tumors derived from KPCs in WT mice vs. those in MG53-KO mice, indicating the accumulation of circulating MG53 during tumor growth. Overall, these findings demonstrated that MG53 functions as a tumor suppressor to inhibit cancer cell proliferation and the tumor growth through transcriptional down-regulating the expression of KIF11 in pancreatic cancer, and provided a new therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,Pancreatic cancer,Proliferation,Mitosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Xiao-Liang Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiangfei He<sup>2<\/sup>, Zobeida Cruz-Monserrate<sup>3<\/sup>, Allen Tsung<sup>1<\/sup>, Jianjie Ma<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Chuanxi Cai<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Surgery, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA,<sup>2<\/sup>Surgery, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH,<sup>3<\/sup>Internal Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cae7e7ab-bd50-4d89-af56-ffdf6fbbc91c","ControlNumber":"1479","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>X.

RNA polymerase III is hyperactive and the products of RNA polymerase III are overexpressed in different types of tumors, including of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Maf1 is an RNA polymerase III repressor that can reduce tRNA biosynthesis via inhibiting the interaction between RNA polymerase and TFIIIB and TFIIIC in nucleus. Maf1 can also inhibit tumor growth and AKT\/mTOR signaling pathway via enhancing PTEN expression mTOR can phosphorylate Maf1 at Ser-75, and the phosphorylated Maf1 will be exported into cytosol and then ubiquitinated; therefore, promote protein synthesis and cell cycle progression in HCC. Aurora-A is a serine\/threonine kinase and plays a vital role in regulating cell cycle progression. Overexpression of Aurora-A has been observed in HCC. However, the relationship between Maf1 and Aurora-A remains unclear.<br \/>Materials and Methods: HCC cells were transfected with pGFP-Aurora-A and pHA-Maf1 to investigate their correlation. Alisertib was added to inhibit Aurora-A activity. RT-qPCR was performed to determine the RNA expression of Aurora-A, Maf1, pre-tRNA<sup>Leu<\/sup> and pre-tRNA<sup>iMet<\/sup>. Western blot was performed to analyze expression levels of Maf1 and Aurora-A. Cycloheximide was added to observe the protein stability of Maf1. The protein interaction between Aurora-A and Maf1 was determined by co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay. The subcellular localization of Maf1 was observed by cell fraction assay and immunofluorescence. The cell proliferation was analyzed by CCK-8.<br \/>Results: Aurora-A can interact with C domain of Maf1, and promote the cytosolic localization and protein stability of Maf1 in a kinase-dependent manner. Two putative Aurora-A phosphorylation sites of Maf1 were mutated, and we found that one of them can result in a nucleolar localization and a reduced protein stability in Maf1. Surprisingly, we also found that overexpression of the Maf1 mutant (Maf1-MT) cannot suppress tRNA biosynthesis compared to WT Maf1. Maf1-overexpressed HCC cells were more sensitive to Aurora-A inhibitors treatment.<br \/>Conclusion: Aurora-A can promote the protein stability and cytosolic localization of Maf1 via interacting with its C domain in a kinase-dependent manner in HCC cells. Aurora-A phosphorylation site mutant of Maf1 can promote nucleolar localization but lost the RNA polymerase III suppressor function. In Maf1 overexpressed HCC cells, Aurora-A inhibitor has a higher efficacy in inhibiting cell growth. In HCC patients with high Aurora-A and Maf1 expression, treatment with Aurora-A inhibitors can be a promising strategy in cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aurora kinase,Hepatocellular carcinoma,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Ya-Ting Jhan<sup><\/sup>, Yi-Seng Gan<sup><\/sup>, <b>Liang-Yi Hung<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Department of Biotechnology and Bioindustry Sciences, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4a5a185f-e274-4ca2-b65b-9a2d83a7a37d","ControlNumber":"4358","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

CD36 also plays a role in lipid metabolism of cancer associated T-cells leading to impaired cytotoxic CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T-cell and enhanced T<sub>reg<\/sub> cell function. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we found that APOC2 acts with CD36 to promote leukemia growth by activating the LYN-ERK signaling. To establish CD36 as a viable therapeutic target in AML, we recently investigated whether targeting CD36 has any detrimental impact on normal hematopoietic cells. We compared B6.129S1-<i>Cd36<sup>tm1Mfe<\/sup><\/i>\/J Cd36 knockout (Cd36-KO) with C57BL\/6J control (WT) mice (N=6 per group). Cd36-KO mice have normal blood counts except for lower red blood cells count (5.85 vs 6.93 (x 10<sup>6<\/sup>\/&#956;L), P = 0.0332), hemoglobin (10.03 vs 11.35 (gr\/dL), P = 0.0109), and hematocrit (31.67 vs 35.48 (%), P = 0.02) than WT mice, yet these values remained within the normal range.<br \/>Cd36-KO mice exhibited similar spleen T cell phenotypes compared with the WT mice and expanded similarly in vitro in the presence IL2 and PHA. The in vitro expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) in HSPC expansion media containing SCF and TPO cytokines was also similar between Cd36-KO mice and WT mice. However, mouse colony forming cell assay using methylcellulose-based media showed that the HSPC of Cd36-KO mice resulted in 40% fewer colonies than WT mouse HSPC cells (P = 0.0003).<br \/>However, when HSPC obtained from Cd36-KO and WT mice were transplanted in CD45.1 mice, their percentage of engraftment were not significantly different in the bone marrow (BM: KO vs WT: 64.92% vs 63.45%, P &#62; 0.9999), spleen (40.88% vs 40.05%, P = 0.8413), and blood (83.47% vs 82.88%, P &#62; 0.9999).<br \/>To assess whether CD36 in the leukemia microenvironment has an impact on leukemia growth and progression, we injected 5 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> FLT3-ITD\/MLL-PTD mouse leukemic cells via tail vein in either Cd36-KO mice (N = 5) or WT mice (N = 6) and compared the percentage of engraftment in their tissues. Cd36-KO mice exhibited similar leukemia engraftment in the BM (88.92% vs 86.38%, P = 0.0497), spleen (76.48% vs 68.10%, P = 0.1627), liver (16.12% vs 6.70%, P = 0.2521), and blood (16.33% vs 0.96%, P = 0.2504) compared with the WT group. Cd36-KO and WT mice developed similar leukemia burden when less aggressive models are used with the engraftment of 1 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> FLT3-ITD\/MLL-PTD mouse leukemic cells.<br \/>Altogether, our preliminary data suggest that loss of Cd36 may influence the hematopoietic stem cell and erythropoiesis yet have limited detrimental overall impact on normal hematopoiesis and leukemia microenvironment. Therefore, targeting CD36 in leukemic cells presents limited toxicity on normal hematopoiesis and therapeutic approaches to target this receptor present safe strategies to treat AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,CD36,Normal Hematopoiesis,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yiting Meng<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Mateusz Pospiech<sup><\/sup>, Atham Ali<sup><\/sup>, Ritu Chandwani<sup><\/sup>, Sandra Onyemaechi<sup><\/sup>, George Yaghmour<sup><\/sup>, Houda Alachkar<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1ead91c2-4a9b-4eb8-bf31-a0cbcaaf0c73","ControlNumber":"7973","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

There are increasing evidence that KISS1\/GPR54 signaling pathway is associated with the development of various cancer. Although KISS1 and GPR54 are expressed in the lung, their biological role in the lung tumorigenesis remains unclear. In this study, using the genetically engineered mouse models, we have identified that loss of Gpr54 inhibited Kras-driven lung tumorigenesis by suppressing pathways in oncogenesis such as the MAPK and AKT pathways and inducing apoptosis. Similarly, genomic inhibition of GPR54 suppressed cell proliferation, decreased ERK and AKT signaling pathway, and increased apoptotic cell death in NSCLC cells. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that DDC expression and glycolysis gene sets were significantly changed in Gpr54 deficient mice. Interestingly, HIF-1&#945; expression is regulated by GPR54\/AKT\/DDC signaling pathway in NSCLC cells, leading to glycolytic change. Genomic inhibition of DDC suppressed cell proliferation and enhanced apoptotic cell death in NSCLC cell lines. Also, pharmacological inhibition of GPR54 and DDC lower glucose consumption and lactate production in NSCLC cell lines. Taken together, we demonstrate GPR54, as a potential therapeutic target, suggesting a new strategy to cure for lung cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-01 Cell death pathways and treatment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR),KRAS,Dopa decarboxylase,Hypoxia-inducible factor1-alpha,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Seo Yeon Lee<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Yu-Jeong Choi<sup><\/sup>, Hyun-Ha Hwang<sup><\/sup>, Sooyeon Kang<sup><\/sup>, Kangwook Lee<sup><\/sup>, Seong-Gyu Ko<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"db95e5bd-dfc6-4754-974b-7bfd564859aa","ControlNumber":"5500","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.
