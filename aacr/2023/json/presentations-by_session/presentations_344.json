[{"Abstract":"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive brain tumor with chemo-resistant, immunosuppressive, and invasive property. Despite the application of standard therapies which include a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy, tumor inevitably recurred (in patients) at peritumoral region. Targeting multiple arms of the GBM-mediated immunosuppressive ability and their invasiveness can improve therapeutic efficacy. Genomic screening identified that IL-19 is a predicted immune suppressive cytokine in peritumoral region and was associated with poor survival in patients with GBM. IL-19 blockade inhibited both TMZ-sensitive and resistant tumor progression. Molecular studies revealed that silencing IL-19 markedly abrogated IL-19-WISP1-AKT signaling to inhibit TMZ-resistant GBM cell invasion, as well as weaken its suppressive ability on CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cell activation. Single cell transcriptome analysis revealed that IL-19 blockade promoted T cell activation, upregulated effector function of T cell subsets, and reprogrammed tumor-associated macrophage subsets toward a weakened pro-tumoral phenotypes. Thus, Targeting IL-19 can be a novel therapeutic strategy to reverse immunosuppressive microenvironment and restrict invasiveness of chemo-resistant GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Immunosuppression,Interleukin 19,chemo-resistant,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Gilbert A.

Outcomes of relapsed\/refractory adult B-ALL remain dismal with long-term survival of less than 10%. Although targeted therapies such as blinatumomab, inotuzumab ozogamicin, and CD19 CAR T cell therapy are a significant treatment advance for patients with B-ALL, there is still an unmet medical need for novel therapies for B-ALL. CRLF2-rearranged B-ALL, a subtype of Philadelphia chromosome-like B-ALL, is a high-risk disease subset with poor long-term outcomes. In an effort to identify new therapeutic targets for B-ALL, we validated by flow cytometry that patients with CRLF2-rearranged Ph-like ALL overexpress thymic stromal lymphopoietin receptor (TSLPR) at levels comparable with CD19. We subsequently generated antibodies against TSLPR from immunized H2L2 Harbor mice through single B cell cloning technology. The lead antibody was further engineered to a CD3-redirecting bispecific antibody (BsAb) using Xencor&#8217;s CD3e bispecific antibody technology to create 1B7\/CD3 BsAb with an Fc-silent region. 1B7\/CD3 BsAb exhibits high affinity binding to both human and cynomolgus monkey CD3e and TSLPR by BLI. Additionally, UHPLC-SEC analysis of 1B7\/CD3 shows that this BsAb is stable without any aggregation or degradation present after five weeks incubation at 37 <sup>o<\/sup>C. In cell-based analyses,1B7\/CD3 BsAb demonstrate potent antigen-specific T cell activation and tumor lysis activity against TSLPR<sup>+<\/sup>-REH and MHH-CALL4 cell lines as well as a primary B-ALL patient sample, but none against human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected from healthy donors. Animal tumor models suggest that 1B7\/CD3 triggers a dose-dependent tumor regression or growth inhibition in PBMC humanized TSLPR-REH CDX and BOS-1 PDX models across donors. Correspondingly, T cell activation and expansion were examined by CD69 and CD3<sup>+<\/sup> T cells with the best effect observed at the 1mg\/kg dose. 1B7\/CD3 exhibits durable PK with T<sub>1\/2 <\/sub>in NSG mice of up to ten days. Finally, 1B7\/CD3 BsAb demonstrated a tolerable safety margin in a two-dose exploratory toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys with MTD equal to or less than 1mg\/kg. Consistent with clinical observation, we observed a transient increase of six major cytokines (IFN&#947;, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, MCP-1 and TNF&#945;) 4hr post the initial dosing, but no notable induction of cytokine levels after the second dosing (except for IL-8). Thus, our preclinical data provide the framework for the clinical evaluation of 1B7\/CD3 BsAb in patients with CRLF2-rearranged B-ALL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,B cells,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ze Tian<\/b><sup><\/sup>, chunhua shi<sup><\/sup>, Amin AI-Shami<sup><\/sup>, GuoJun Yong<sup><\/sup>, Jason K Allen<sup><\/sup>, Jill Wardell Olson<sup><\/sup>, Melinda G Smith<sup><\/sup>, Qing Chang<sup><\/sup>, Qing Shi<sup><\/sup>, Junping You<sup><\/sup>, Michelle A Gonzalez<sup><\/sup>, Timothy E Lofton<sup><\/sup>, Jasbir Kaur<sup><\/sup>, Qi Zhang<sup><\/sup>, DongXing Zha<sup><\/sup>, Nitin Jain<sup><\/sup>, Marina Y Konopleva<sup><\/sup>, Timothy Heffernan<sup><\/sup>, Jeffrey J Molldrem<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"12f2d995-afe6-4661-af58-17ef55930666","ControlNumber":"3916","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Z.

There remains a unmet need for additional therapies due to treatment resistance. Tumor-necrosis superfamily members, such as CD137 and CD40, have been shown to synergize with the checkpoint inhibitors in preclinical studies. However, agonists antibodies have exhibited limited clinical activity for severe liver toxicity. Here we have developed a Fc-silenced bispecific antibody targeting PD-L1 and CD137, HK010, which could overcome these limitations by tumor-directed T-cell activation and checkpoint blockade.<br \/>Methods: The antigen binding specificity and affinity of HK010 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and flow cytometry. The functional activity of HK010 was determined using in vitro cell-based assays and reporter gene assay. Transgenic mice expressing human PD-L1 and 4-1BB were transplanted with human PD-L1-expressing murine MC38 cells to assess in vivo antitumor activity. Cytokine release assay was conducted by incubating HK010 with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors (n=6). The pharmacokinetic (PK) behavior and safety profiles of HK010 were characterized in cynomolgus monkeys.<br \/>Results: HK010 is a IgG4 PD-L1x4-1BB bsAb, which was designed to maintain a high affinity for human PD-L1 and a low affinity for human 4-1BB (KD PD-L1: 2.27 nM; KD 4-1BB: 493 nM) to achieve strong blocking of PD-1\/PD-L1 and appropriate agonism of 4-1BB. HK010 retained full blockade activity on PD-1\/PD-L1 signaling and enhances T-cell proliferation and IFN-&#947; production in vitro primary cell assays and Mixed lymphoid reaction (MLR). In addition, it led to a dose-dependent increase in the CD137-driven NF&#954;B reporter gene activation through the bridging of PD-L1 on target cells and CD137 on effector cells. In humanized PD-L1\/4-1BB transgenic mice bearing with MC38\/hPDL1 tumor, HK010 showed robust single agent anti-tumor activity and induced durable antigen-specific immunological memory that prevents the growth of the same tumor cells in the mice re-challenged. There were no signs of toxicity in human cytokine release assay for HK010. Toxicology data in cynomolgus monkeys showed that HK010 was well-tolerated up to 150 mg\/kg (MTD&#8805;150mg\/kg) dose without systemic toxicity. Furthermore, HK010 was confirmed to be highly safe in the 5-week repeated-dose toxicity study with no observed treatment-related mortality, abnormality in hematological indexes, important organs.<br \/>Conclusion: These data demonstrate that HK010, an anti-PD-L1&#215;CD137 bispecific antibody, may exert a strong localized anti-tumor therapeutic efficacy with a low risk of liver toxicity through tumor-directed T-cell activation and checkpoint blockade in tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,agonist,4-1BB,PD-L1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Liangwei Li<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Wenting Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Guodong Shen<sup>3<\/sup>, Dayan Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Weiming Zhou<sup>2<\/sup>, Fengrong Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiaoli Zeng<sup>2<\/sup>, Yang Huang<sup>1<\/sup>, Liansheng Cheng<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA,<sup>2<\/sup>Hefei Hankemab Biotechnology Co., LTD, He Fei, China,<sup>3<\/sup>The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, He Fei, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"559fa5a7-856d-420d-94e8-25c37835294b","ControlNumber":"2755","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

Among various formats of bispecific molecules, the heterodimeric Fc currently is a favorable scaffold for the design of bispecific antibodies because of its structural similarity to the natural antibody. However, development of molecules based on this concept is challenged by the presence of potential homodimer contamination, reduced yield, and stability loss relative to the natural Fc. Here, we report the development of the MG-Ig platform by grafting a single chain fragment variable (scFv) onto the hinge region of a full-size immunoglobulin with a different specificity to produce a trivalent IgG-like bispecific antibody that retains natural homodimer Fc. Whereas the MG-Ig platform is evolved from the Dock-and-Lock (DNL) technology which exploits the interaction between the anchoring domain (AD) of A kinase anchor proteins and the dimerization and docking domain (DDD) of regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, the main distinctions include 1) the AD-fused scFv monomer is judiciously designed to graft onto the DDD dimer inserted into the hinge region of IgG, forming a bispecific antibody with three (1+2) binding arms and 2) all modular subunits are expressed in a single host cell and self-assemble to generate the bioactive conjugate <i>in situ<\/i>. To validate the method, bispecific T-cell engagers, designated 3scFv&#215;hL0125C (CD3&#215;Trop2) and 3scFv&#215;hACD20C (CD3&#215;CD20), which redirect T cells to Trop2 and CD20, respectively, have been produced with high yield and purity. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated the bispecific binding of 3scFv&#215;hL0125C to both CD3 on Jurkat and Trop2 on ME-180 with unaltered affinities. These T-cell redirecting bispecific antibodies mediated dose-dependent killing of target cancer cells when co-incubated with human PBMCs. Based on the 60-h viability assays using MTS, the IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 3scFv&#215;hL0125C was about 6 pM for MDA-MB-468, 13 pM for MDA-MB-231, 20 pM for BT-474, and 18 pM for HCT116. In 3D culture of HCT116 cells, the formation of multicellular tumor spheroids was impeded by 3scFv&#215;hL0125C at 19.5 pM or higher, which is consistent with the cytotoxicity assays for tumor cells grown in monolayer. In addition, 3scFv&#215;hL0125C was stable in human plasma for 7 days at 37&#176;C, retaining<br \/>bispecific integrity and binding activity. These data are promising and merit further development of MG-Ig bispecific antibodies for preclinical and clinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,T cell engager,Molecularly grafted,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Donglin Liu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Li Zeng<sup>1<\/sup>, Berenice  E.

Most current immunotherapeutic targets are tumor-associated antigens also found in healthy tissues. Such targets often do not display sufficient cancer selectivity to be used for potent antibody based immunotherapeutic treatments, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Many solid tumors, however, display aberrant glycosylation that results in the expression of tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens that are not present on healthy tissues. Targeting aberrantly glycosylated glycopeptide epitopes within existing or novel glycoprotein targets may provide the cancer selectivity needed for immunotherapy of solid tumours, but only a few such glycopeptide epitopes have been targeted. Here, we used <i>O<\/i>-glycoproteomics data from multiple cell lines to identify a glycopeptide epitope in CD44v6, a cancer-associated CD44 isoform, and through a glycopeptide immunization strategy developed a cancer-specific monoclonal antibody, 4C8. 4C8 selectively binds to Tn-glycosylated CD44v6 in a site-specific manner with low nanomolar affinity. 4C8 was shown to be highly cancer selective by immunohistochemistry of sections from multiple healthy and cancerous tissues. 4C8 CAR T cells demonstrated target-specific cytotoxicity <i>in vitro <\/i>and significant tumor regression, and increased survival <i>in vivo<\/i>. Importantly, 4C8 CAR T cells selectively killed target cells in a mixed organotypic skin cancer model without affecting healthy CD44v6+ keratinocytes, indicating tolerability and safety. Targeting aberrantly glycosylated glycopeptide epitopes may provide the cancer selectivity needed for solid tumour immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Glycosylation,CD44,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mikkel K.M.

The recent development of antibody-cytokine fusion proteins, or immunocytokines, aims to localize cytokine activity to the tumor microenvironment and thus improve their therapeutic index. We have developed IGM-7354, a high affinity, high avidity anti-PD-L1 pentameric IgM antibody with an IL-15R&#945; chain and IL-15 fused to the joining (J) chain. The IGM-7354 immunocytokine was designed to deliver IL-15-mediated stimulation of NK and CD8+ T cells to PD-L1-expressing tumors and antigen-presenting cells, to enhance anti-tumor immune responses. The multivalent binding of IGM-7354 to PD-L1 provided a stronger binding avidity for human PD-L1 than the monovalent binding of IL-15 to IL-15Rb as confirmed in kinetic binding assays. In vitro IGM-7354 induced the proliferation of a cytotoxic T cell line responsive to IL-15 stimulation and enhanced the proliferation of NK and CD8+ T cells from healthy donor human PBMCs. In cytotoxicity assays with human PBMC and PD-L1+ cancer cell lines, IGM-7354 enhanced cancer cell killing through NK and CD8+ T cell expansion and cytotoxic activity, evidenced by Ki67 and Granzyme B upregulation in these cell populations. Next, in vivo pharmacodynamic studies were performed in two humanized mouse models: non-tumor-bearing BRGSF-HIS mice engrafted with human CD34+ cells, and PD-L1+ MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing MHC-\/- NSG mice engrafted with human PBMCs. In the BRGSF model, IGM-7354 increased NK cell activation and Granzyme B expression as well as NK and CD8+ T cell proliferation. In the tumor-bearing mouse model, IGM-7354 dose-dependently increased NK and CD8+ T cell proliferation in blood and infiltration of lymphocytes into the tumor. This pharmacodynamic activity correlated with IGM-7354 anti-tumor activity in the MDA-MB-231 model. Lastly, IGM-7354 increased the proliferation of NK and CD8+ T cells in cynomolgus monkeys and particularly induced the expansion of effector memory CD8+ T cells in the periphery. In summary, IGM-7354 induces NK and CD8+ T cell proliferation in both in vitro and in vivo preclinical models, resulting in the killing of PD-L1+ tumor cells. The strong avidity of IGM-7354 for PD-L1 may enhance IL-15 delivery to tumors and antigen-presenting cells and thus provide a more favorable safety profile. A Phase 1 clinical trial is planned.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunocytokines,Interleukin-15,PD-L1,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Thierry D.

Here we describe the preclinical development of a trispecific antibody (KJ-101) targeting dopamine receptor 2 (DRD2), PD-1, and CD47.<br \/>DRD2 is a G protein-coupled receptor upregulated in many cancer types where it correlates with decreased patient survival. In pre-clinical studies, DRD2 is associated with cancer cell stemness and tumor growth. Clinical responses were achieved with small molecules targeting DRD2 and dopaminergic drugs for neuroendocrine tumors. In SCLC, representing 15% of lung cancers, 60-70% of patients showed high expression of DRD2. Checkpoint inhibition has shown some efficacy in lung cancer where PD-L1 inhibitors were approved as first-line therapy in SCLC . SCLC patients rapidly fail chemotherapy, develop resistance to treatment and metastases. These observations suggest a link between DRD2 expression and resistance to treatment, making this receptor an attractive target for multispecific antibody therapy.<br \/>The VHH components of KJ-101 (anti-DRD2, anti-PD-1 and anti-CD47) produce multiple effects to achieve a strong anti-tumor activity. The anti-DRD2 VHH induces intracellular signaling and suppresses tumor growth via ADCC. Treatment with anti-DRD2 antibody significantly suppressed tumor growth in the DRD2-positive NCI-H510A SCLC model in SCID mice. The anti-PD-1 VHH restores T cell function, and the anti-CD47 VHH recruits T cells without their generalized activation and blocks the interaction between CD47 and SIRP&#945;. The KJ-101 anti-tumor efficacy was tested in several <i>in vivo<\/i> immuno-oncology xenograft models of human SCLC or TNBC, reconstituted with human PBMC or with CD34+ hemopoietic stem cells. KJ-101 treatment led to tumor regression in the TNBC model, blocked metastases formation in CD34+ humanized NCG mice bearing established NCI-H69 tumors, and blocked metastases formation and increased survival in tail vein metastatic models of SCLC. KJ-101 is produced at a high yield (6 g\/L) in a manufacturing cell line. Conventional purification yields 99% purity and notably displays high stability under accelerated stability testing.<br \/>In conclusion, the trispecific KJ-101 antibody has strong <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor activity mediated via multiple mechanisms of action, is easily expressed and purified, and is very stable. Together, this data supports the clinical development of KJ-101 in advanced metastatic neuroendocrine cancer indications, including SCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Solid tumors,Monoclonal antibodies,Trispecific antibody,Checkpoint Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shugang Yao<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hiba Zahreddine<sup>1<\/sup>, Dominic Hou<sup>1<\/sup>, Elijus Undzys<sup>2<\/sup>, Liying Gong<sup>1<\/sup>, Richard Wargachuk<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaowei Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Alex Zhou<sup>2<\/sup>, Lucy Lai<sup>1<\/sup>, Luis A.

Reversing the immunosuppression is a recognized pathway for enhancing the activity of existing IO therapies. LILRB2 (ILT4) is a key receptor for macrophage maturation and polarization and an emerging therapeutic target in immuno-oncology. This research aims to produce anti-LILRB2 antibodies to redirect the polarization of myeloid cells, specifically macrophages, in the tumor microenvironment. The LILRB2 antibodies were generated through the mouse hybridoma method. After humanization and maturation, potent and selective IgG4 anti-LILRB2 antibodies were obtained. Binding affinities were evaluated through ELISA and 293T-LILRB2 cell flow cytometry binding assays which demonstrated sub-nanomolar binding affinity as well as effective blocking of the interaction of LILRB2 with its ligands HLA-G and HLA-A2 for multiple antibodies. SPX-104 was shown to redirect macrophage polarization in primary cultured human PBMC and human monocyte derived macrophage (HMDM) models. SPX-104 treatment induced hTNFa expression and suppressed hIL10 expression in the LPS stimulated PBMC model. In the HMDM model, SPX-104 effectively induced pro-inflammatory cytokine hTNF&#945; expression in M-CSF. Furthermore, an autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (auto-MLR) assay to evaluate T cell response showed dose-dependent increases in hIFN&#947; and hGM-CSF expression following SPX-104 treatment.

Overall, 5-year survival in pediatric ALL patients approaches 90%, but 10-15% of patients will relapse. In relapse, ALL is still challenging to cure with 5-year overall survival rates being at or just below 50% and traditional therapies in this space have been highly toxic. Novel immunotherapies such as blinatumomab, inotuzumab and CAR T-cells have improved outcomes and reduced toxicities but are not curated to some of the most vulnerable patients in relapse including T-cell ALL (for which there are no FDA approved immunotherapies) and Philadelphia-like B-ALL. Thus, unmet needs remain in relapsed\/refractory (r\/r) ALL. The IL-7 and TSLP axes play an important role in B-ALL and T-ALL including in chemotherapy resistance. CD127 (IL7RA) is an attractive target due to limited expression in normal tissues, as confirmed with a GLP.<br \/>We are developing 4A10, a novel monoclonal antibody against CD127 which labels ALL cells for degradation via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and inhibiting IL-7 signaling in T-ALL. 4A10 has demonstrated robust in-vitro and in-vivo anti-cancer activity in pre-clinical PDX models. The antibody substantially reduces circulating tumor burden and organ infiltration, and prolongs overall survival in both na&#239;ve and chemotherapy resistant PDX models. Thus, 4A10 holds promise as a novel agent in patients with r\/r ALL.<br \/>4A10 manufacturing has been successfully scaled up, with a stable master cell bank and good yields at the 200L scale. Our clinical formulation showed no refrigerated or frozen degradation over 3 months and minimal degradation or aggregation at 25&#176;C. In their pre-IND guidance, FDA confirmed that our approach to physicochemical and biological characterization of 4A10 and our proposed analytical methods and tests appear acceptable for early clinical development.<br \/>4A10 was well-tolerated in rodent and non-human primate (NHP) toxicological studies with a No Observable Adverse Event Level (NOAEL) in NHPs well in excess of the expected therapeutic dose. Repeat dose NHP pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies support weekly dosing and do not indicate dose accumulation. Although pivotal GLP toxicology studies have yet to be completed, initial NHP studies do not provide any indications of concern.<br \/>We plan to initiate a Phase I\/IIA study in 2023 to assess 4A10 in patients with r\/r ALL. The Phase I portion of the study will determine the recommended Phase II dose, and the Phase IIA expansion cohorts have been designed to provide clinical proof of concept. The clinical study will be conducted in partnership with the Therapeutic Advances in Childhood Leukemia and Lymphoma (TACL) consortium and key adult centers. If our Phase I\/IIA is successful, we expect to follow with a single pivotal Phase II trial for marketing approval.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC),Cytokines,Immunotherapy,Leukemias: acute lymphoblastic,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Uksha Saini<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Julie Hixon<sup>2<\/sup>, Gisele Rodrigues<sup>3<\/sup>, Christopher Foley<sup>4<\/sup>, Leniher Castan Chibas<sup>1<\/sup>, Ross Hamilton<sup>1<\/sup>, Wenqing Li<sup>3<\/sup>, Eric S.

The first-line treatment of AML is usually induction chemotherapy, followed by further chemo-\/radiation therapies or stem cell transplant. Targeted therapy tailored for specific&nbsp;driver mutations could be alternative treatment options, <i>e.g<\/i>., new inhibitors targeting IDH mutations and FLT3-ITR CSF1R is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) responsible for the growth, survival and polarization of certain myeloid lineages of cells including macrophages. It is also frequently expressed in certain AML patient populations , thus implicated in the pathogenesis, or a new possible drug target of AML.<br \/>To test this hypothesis, a novel kinase inhibitor, HX301 with strong anti-CSF1R activity (IC<sub>50<\/sub> of ~0.7nM) as well as anti-FLT3 (IC<sub>50<\/sub> of ~7nM), were assessed for anti-AML activity. First, an <i>in vitro<\/i> proliferation assay was performed using primary macrophages and a panel of AML cell lines, confirming that HX-301 has high potency in primary macrophage culture (IC<sub>50<\/sub> of ~70nM) and also among cultures of a subsets of AML lines (<i>e.g<\/i>. IC50 &#60; 1&#181;M), such as MV4-11 (medium CSF1R expressing and FLT3-ITD), EOL1, MOL13, <i>etc<\/i>. Next, HX301 was pharmacologically modeled using four preclinical models to test anti-leukemia activity <i>in vivo<\/i>, including subcutaneous xenograft of MV4-11 cells (CDX) and systemically engrafted PDX models AM8096 (high CSF1R expression but wild type FLT3), AM7577 (FLT3-ITD but little CSF1R expression) and AM5512 (wild-type FLT3 and little CSF1R expression).<br \/>Our data demonstrated that HX301 partially inhibited MV4-11 tumor growth as measured by tumor volume, consistent with the <i>in vitro<\/i> observation, possibly due to the inhibition of CSF1R or FLT3-ITD, or both. On the other hand, HX301 completely suppressed leukemogenesis of AM8096, likely due to the inhibition of CSF1R. This observation suggested that CSF1R is likely the driving mechanism for the leukemogenesis of this model; or in another word, for being a PDX, CSF1R likely drives pathogenesis in the original patient. HX301 also suppressed AM7577 growth, likely due to the suppression of FLT3-ITD activity since we previously reported FLT3-ITD being the driver mutation in this model which responded to AC220, a FLT3 TKi. Lastly, HX301 has little activity against AM5512.<br \/>All the data suggests that HX301 can potentially be explored for the treatment of AML, at least a subset of the patients with CSF1R and FLT3-ITD as leukemogenic drivers. Further preclinical\/translational studies are being conducted in order to reveal predictive biomarkers, in addition to FLT3 mutation and CSF1R expression\/mutations. We believe that HX301 could be a potential candidate for treating subset of AML, warranting further clinical investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,CSF1R,Antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xiaoyu An<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Henry Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Linda Xue<sup>3<\/sup>, Jinping Liu<sup>4<\/sup>, Lingxin Xiong<sup>1<\/sup>, Hang Ke<sup>2<\/sup>, Cen Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Bing Gao<sup>4<\/sup>, Jia Zheng<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhengzheng Bao<sup>4<\/sup>, Sheng Guo<sup>3<\/sup>, Lei Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Faming Zhang<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Crown Bioscience, Inc., Taicang, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Hanx Biopharmaceuticals, Ltd, Wuhan, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Crown Bioscience, Inc., Suzhou, China,<sup>4<\/sup>Crown Bioscience, Inc., Beijing, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"52548070-1fa2-4d0b-9982-ade9685c6990","ControlNumber":"4586","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;X.

SGNTGT-001 (NCT04254107) is a phase 1 clinical trial that evaluated the safety and tolerability of SEA&#8209;TGT as monotherapy in solid tumors and lymphomas at doses ranging from 0.01 to 6 mg\/kg. Because an MTD was not identified in dose escalation, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints were measured to assess biological activity and inform dose selection. The biological activity of SEA-TGT as monotherapy was compared across different dose levels using a clinical utility index (CUI), which mathematically integrated multiple clinically-meaningful PK and PD endpoints into a single readout. PD endpoints included NK and CD8+ T cell proliferation, maintenance of overall peripheral CD8+ T cell numbers, depletion of peripheral regulatory T cells, and peripheral target engagement. The PK endpoint was pharmacokinetic linearity. Surrogates of predicted tumor efficacy metrics included tumor target engagement and formation of the TIGIT:SEA-TGT:Fc receptor gamma (Fc&#947;RIIIa) trimer complexes in the tumor. An increase in the CUI score, representing an increase in biological activity, was observed during dose escalation, with an apparent plateau between the 0.3 and 6.0 mg\/kg levels. Based on safety signals at 6 mg\/kg and PK variability at lower doses, 1 and 3 mg\/kg were of most interest for further evaluation. Both 1 and 3 mg\/kg represented biologically active dose levels as they showed PK and PD activity that were within desirable ranges and had similarly high overall CUI scores relative to all doses evaluated. Dose selection for SEA-TGT was based on biological activity as assessed via PK\/PD endpoints and integrated into a CUI model. Based on the totality of clinical data and the CUI results from monotherapy dose escalation from SGNTGT-001, the SEA-TGT dose of 1 mg\/kg was determined to be the lowest biologically active dose with acceptable safety and tolerability.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TIGIT,Clinical Utility Index,Immuno-oncology,Nonfucosylated antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Gabriela Patilea-Vrana<\/b><sup><\/sup>, John Harrold<sup><\/sup>, Joseph  A.

However, the clinical application of IL-2 is limited by systemic activation of unexpected immune cells, leading to severe toxicities including vascular leakage syndrome (VLS). These adverse effects were mainly caused by the activation of Treg and endothelial cells bearing IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) &#945;&#946;&#947;. Recently, studies have mainly focused on the optimization of IL-2Rs binding affinity to selectively invigorate CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in tumors, but the toxicity risk has yet to be solved. To overcome these limitations, we developed MB201, a novel anti-PD-L1 x IL-2v fusion protein, which selectively activates CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells by attenuating binding affinity to IL-2R&#946;&#947; with no binding to IL-2R&#945;.<br \/>MB201 showed a strong binding affinity to PD-L1 (K<sub>D<\/sub> value is 0.5 nM) and a weak binding affinity to IL-2R&#946;&#947; and IL-2R&#945;&#946;&#947; (K<sub>D<\/sub> value is 23.8 nM and 30.6 nM, respectively), indicating the preferential targeting PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cells. MB201 exhibited a preferential activation of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells than Treg cells, which showed remarkably reduced activation compared to rhIL-2 (more than 100-fold based on EC50). Consistently with the result of T cell activation, MB201 only increased the expansion of CD8+ T cells rather than Treg cells in CD3-stimulated PBMC. Indeed, MB201 induced negligible expansion of immune cells and lower pro-inflammatory cytokine release compared to the rhIL-2 in CD3-unstimulated PBMC, indicating the reduced peripheral toxicity risk. When administered to MC38 syngeneic mice, MB201 showed superior anti-tumor efficacy without both body weight reduction and lung weight gain compared to the avelumab monotherapy or combination therapy with rhIL-2. These preclinical observations support that MB201 has characteristics of a superb safety profile and excellent anti-tumor efficacy, and it may offer an advantageous therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Immunocytokine,anti PD-L1xIL-2v fusion protein,Peripheral toxicity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Bom Park<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Hyojoo Bang<sup><\/sup>, Youngjun Jung<sup><\/sup>, Sunjung Cho<sup><\/sup>, Mi Seong Kim<sup><\/sup>, Seok Chan Kang<sup><\/sup>, Sungyoub Jung<sup><\/sup>, Youngjin Park<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Mustbio, Suwon, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e1ea9a44-1e80-4149-a323-bee52044f1da","ControlNumber":"5795","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>B.

Pre-clinical research into mechanisms of ICI resistance is reliant upon anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment in mouse models of cancer. Common approaches utilize commercially-available rat isotype anti-PD-L1 antibodies given by intraperitoneal (IP) injection at relatively high doses (5mg\/kg every 2-3 days), often for extended periods. However, there has been limited investigation into the pharmacokinetics of these antibodies with single and repeat dosing, which could inform rational dose scheduling. Non-species-matched antibodies are known to induce accelerated anti-drug immune responses, compared to species-matched antibodies. As a result, we hypothesized that matched-isotype anti-PD-L1 (based on the grafting of atezolizumab variable regions onto a mouse IgG2a scaffold) and unmatched-isotype rat IgG2b anti-PD-L1 would be associated with distinct pharmacokinetics on single and repeated dosing. We first confirmed that both matched and unmatched antibodies have nanomolar-range affinity for mouse PD-L1 by surface plasmon resonance (0.85nM and 0.37nM, respectively). Using a single IP injection in 8-week-old male C57BL\/6J mice followed by repeated tail-vein plasma sampling and an indirect anti-PD-L1 ELISA, we detected a trend towards prolonged median half-life for the matched (n=17 mice) versus unmatched (n=19) antibody (91.5 versus 39.0 hours). We detected a particularly wide range of half-life measurements for matched antibody experiments (19.8 to 337.7 hours), suggesting that antibody clearance can be highly heterogeneous. Using repeated IP injection (2 doses, 14 days apart), we identified markedly accelerated antibody clearance for both antibodies resulting in comparable antibody half-lives after dose 2 (11.9 versus 12.5 hours, n=13 and n=8 mice, respectively), suggestive of a time-dependent anti-drug adaptive immune response. These findings have significant implications for <i>in vivo<\/i> antibody treatment experiments, demonstrating that repeat dosing is associated with rapid antibody clearance, irrespective of the antibody species. These data should be taken into consideration when planning longer-term antagonism of PD-1\/PD-L1 signaling with antibodies in mice and strengthen the basis for short term window studies that examine the intratumoral immune biology. Furthermore, the high variability in antibody half-life suggests that antibody pharmacokinetics could confound ICI treatment response studies <i>in vivo<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Antibody,Pharmacokinetics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Breanna Demestichas<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sam Kleeman<sup><\/sup>, Matthew Chvasta<sup><\/sup>, Tobias Janowitz<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ef1c33be-947e-4f88-8345-c4e35ef01719","ControlNumber":"2904","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>B.

By blocking CD39 in the TME, particularly in combination with immunogenic cell death (ICD)-inducing chemotherapies, local levels of ATP can increase, leading to myeloid cell activation and improved tumor control. AB598 potently binds and inhibits enzymatic activity of human and cynomolgus CD39 but not murine CD39. Human CD39 knock-in (hCD39KI) mice have been employed to determine anti-tumor efficacy of AB598 in animals with competent immune systems.<br \/>Methods: Binding affinity and enzymatic inhibition of AB598 were determined in primary human immune cells. ATP-mediated activation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) and macrophages were assayed <i>in vitro<\/i> with and without AB598. Whole blood and tissue-based receptor occupancy (RO) assays were developed using AB598-competitive and non-competitive anti-CD39 reagents. <i>In vitro<\/i> binding of AB598 was determined in samples from human and cynomolgus donors. CD39 protein expression, target engagement, and enzymatic inhibition were assessed in whole blood and tissue samples collected from AB598-dosed animals. CD39 expression patterns in peripheral immune subsets were confirmed in samples from healthy human donors. CD39 enzymatic activity was evaluated in blood-derived cells and serum from healthy human donors and cancer patients.<br \/>Results: AB598 binds to CD39-expressing monocytes, B cells, and other immune cell populations in human and cynomolgus whole blood with sub-nanomolar affinity. Following AB598 dosing in preclinical species, decreases in CD39 surface expression on peripheral immune cells were observed, consistent with other anti-CD39 therapeutic antibodies. Target engagement and enzymatic inhibition were evident in tissues collected from AB598-dosed animals. Treatment with AB598\/chemotherapy combinations resulted in significant syngeneic tumor control in hCD39KI mouse models.<br \/>Conclusion: When used in combination with an ICD-inducing chemotherapy agent, AB598 can promote anti-tumor immunity by activation of myeloid cells due to increased local ATP levels.

However, CCR8 is also expressed on memory T cell subpopulations and the consequences of their depletion are still unclear. In an attempt to rationally design highly-specific Treg-depleting agents, TIGIT and CTLA-4 were selected as binding targets for engineering CCR8-based IgG-like bispecifics for highly effective depletion of CCR8\/TIGIT or TIGIT\/CTLA-4 double-positive Tregs that are enriched in tumors.

EGFR, a tyrosine kinase receptor, plays a central role in cellular proliferation, survival, differentiation, and migration. Gain-of-function somatic mutations of EGFR significantly drives disease progression. Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), designed to inhibit EGFR signaling specific to these mutations (e.g., L858R and E19del etc.), have achieved excellent clinical outcomes. However, patients carrying TKI-insensitive mutations (e.g., E20ins) and\/or those with disease progression after TKI treatment, by the upregulation of complementary signaling pathways (HGF\/c-MET, etc.), remain an unmet medical need. Here, we report the discovery of a fully-human afucosylated anti-EGFR x cMET IgG-like bispecific antibody (PM1080).<br \/>Methods: PM1080 was generated by introducing unique mutations to the CH1-CL domains of each binding arm to promote correct HC-LC pairing. KIH mutations were also introduced to each CH3 domain to support HC-HC heterodimerization and generate an IgG-like bispecific with one arm binding to EGFR and the other to cMET. PM1080 was expressed via a four-chain expression system in CHO cells carrying a <i>fut8<sup>-\/-<\/sup> <\/i>knockout<sup> <\/sup>to generate afucosylated molecules with enhanced ADCC activity.<br \/>Results: Through monovalent affinity measurements, PM1080 interacted with EGFR at single digit nanomolar affinity and at sub-nanomolar affinity to c-MET. PM1080 preferentially bound to EGFR\/c-MET double-positive cells rather than EGFR single-positive cells. PM1080 blocked both EGF\/EGFR and HGF\/c-MET signals via physical blockade of the interaction between EGF\/HGF to their corresponding receptors and induced EGFR\/c-MET internalization and degradation from the cell surface. Through intricate engineering, PM1080 was expressed via a four-chain system and produced as an afucosylated antibody with significantly improved ADCC function. PM1080 induced potent anti-tumor efficacy against EGFR\/c-MET-positive tumor cells as a single agent. Importantly, PM1080 induced anti-tumor activity regardless of EGFR mutations at the intracellular signaling domain, and thus may serve as a promising combinational agent to TKI therapies. As expected, synergistic anti-tumor activity was observed when PM1080 was combined with either 1<sup>st<\/sup> or 3<sup>rd<\/sup> generation TKIs in both <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i> models.<br \/>Conclusion: PM1080, a bispecific antibody targeting EGFR &#38; c-MET was discovered for cancer treatment. PM1080 displayed potent anti-tumor efficacy either as a single agent or in combination with EGFR TKIs.

However, the clinical development of these agents has been hampered by limited efficacy and\/or poor tolerability at active doses. To overcome the efficacy and safety limitations of this approach, SGN-BB228, a first-in-class, investigational CD228 x 4-1BB costimulatory Antibody Anticalin&#174; bispecific (Mabcalin<sup>TM<\/sup>) was created. SGN-BB228 is designed to target CD228 (melanotransferrin), a GPI-anchored oncofetal membrane protein with limited normal tissue expression, but high prevalence and expression in melanoma, mesothelioma, lung cancer, and other tumor types. SGN-BB228 is designed to provide a potent costimulatory bridge between tumor-specific T cells and tumor cells, improving and limiting T cell-mediated cytotoxicity to tumors, potentially expanding the therapeutic window for 4-1BB agonism. Here we describe the anti-tumor activity and pharmacodynamic effects of SGN-BB228 in vivo using humanized mouse tumor models, and the in vitro costimulatory effect of SGN-BB228 in a tumor cell line-based model of functional T cell exhaustion. In vivo, SGN-BB228 improved the quality and magnitude of the cytotoxic T cell response within CD228-expressing tumors, augmenting anti-tumor immunity. In vitro, 4-1BB costimulation provided by SGN-BB228 elicited proliferation, and cytokine production from functionally exhausted human T cells when in culture with CD228-expressing tumor cell lines engineered to engage the T cell receptor. Functionally exhausted T cells in this system are a mixed population that share phenotypic markers and single cell transcriptional signatures associated with either progenitor exhausted T cells (T<sub>PEX<\/sub>) or terminally exhausted T cells (T<sub>EX<\/sub>). Interestingly, in this system, anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) failed to reinvigorate functionally exhausted T cells despite high PD-L1 expression by tumor cells. The unique ability of 4-1BB costimulation provided by SGN-BB228 to improve T cell activity in this model suggests the potential to drive immunomodulation in circumstances where PD-1 blockade fails. Together these data highlight SGN-BB228, a first-in-class, investigational CD228 x 4-1BB costimulatory Antibody Anticalin&#174; bispecific with potent and CD228-conditional 4-1BB costimulatory activity with therapeutic potential in multiple solid tumor types.

However, despite numerous CD3-based bsAb have been developed, the clinical application faces pronounced hurdles, such as increased on-target off-tumor toxicity and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) by using high-affinity anti-CD3 moieties. Accordingly, there are still needs for the development of CD3-based bsAb with more favorable properties, which are tumor-specific targeting and potent tumor killing activity without excessive cytokine release. Thus, we developed MB101, a novel PD-L1 x CD3 bsAb with low affinity to CD3, which is uncoupled potent tumor cytotoxicity from severe cytokine release. MB101 showed a strong binding affinity to PD-L1 (K<sub>D<\/sub> = 0.4 nM) but a weak binding affinity to CD3 (K<sub>D<\/sub> = 1.0 &#956;M), indicating preferentially targeting to PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cells. MB101 showed an effective tumor cell killing activity with higher Emax compared to avelumab mono- or combination treatment with CD3 mAb in PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup> MDA-MB-231 cells. T cell-mediated cytotoxicity stimulated by MB101 in co-culture with target cells was accompanied by lower secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines than CD3 mAb and bsAb comparator with high-affinity anti-CD3 arm. Additionally, in the absence of target cells, MB101 treatment to PBMC induced a very low level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting the possibility of reduced CRS risk. Furthermore, we proved that T cell-mediated cytotoxicity by MB101 was increased in a PD-L1 expression-dependent manner of tumor cells, but not normal cells, indicating minimal on-target off-tumor toxicity. Consistently with <i>in vitro<\/i> results, MB101 effectively regressed tumor volume (TGI=83%) without induction of excessive cytokine release in human CD3 knock-in mouse model. In addition, MB101 showed superior tumor growth inhibition (TGI=70%) than that of avelumab (TGI=44%) in humanized mouse xenograft model. In summary, MB101 selectively triggers robust PD-L1-dependent tumor cytotoxicity while inducing very low cytokine release, suggesting that MB101 might be a promising therapeutic option as CD3-based bsAb for cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Bispecific antibody,PD-L1xCD3,off-tumor toxicity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Suna Kim<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Hyojoo Bang<sup><\/sup>, Yongjun Jung<sup><\/sup>, Sunjung Cho<sup><\/sup>, Youngsam Kim<sup><\/sup>, Sang-hyun Park<sup><\/sup>, Seok Chan Kang<sup><\/sup>, Youngjin Park<sup><\/sup>, Sungyoub Jung<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Mustbio, Suwon-si, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c60a89a8-4ce6-4324-9a3d-e8537d71ee54","ControlNumber":"1052","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Barriers to successful T cell checkpoint therapies may be addressed by redirection of T cells toward tumor antigens using T cell engagers that function independently of MHC presented T cell epitopes. Here we demonstrate that an octavalent, tetraspecific Guidance and Navigation Control (GNC) antibody, GNC-035, binds to ROR1, CD3, PD-L1, and 4-1BB and mediates redirected T cell cytolysis of human solid tumor and leukemia and lymphoma cell lines in a ROR1 specific manner.<br \/>Experiments using GNC-035 to redirect T cell cytotoxicity toward ROR1+ cancer cell targets show the T cells in PBMC are highly functionalized by pre-exposure to GNC-035. This pre-exposure of PBMC to GNC-035 results in greater tumor cell killing efficacy compared to concurrent exposure of tumor cells in the presence of T cell effectors. This result suggests that the systemic delivery of GNC-035 can condition the T cell compartment to increase the therapeutic impact of T cells migrating to solid tumors, with or without preexisting infiltrating T cells. This beneficial conditioning of T cells by pre-exposure to GNC-035 is not observed with pre-exposure to CD3xROR1 bi-specific T cell engager controls.<br \/>To evaluate the potential for GNC-035 to mediate cytokine release syndrome, the molecule is evaluated in soluble formats in the presence of PBMC and the ROR1+ A549 cancer cells, or HUVEC cells. Under these conditions, the cytolysis of A549 target cells is detectable after exposure to GNC-035 at 100 fM concentrations as well as the release of IFN-&#947; and certain other inflammatory cytokines at 24 or 48 hours post-treatment. However, consistent with Blinatumomab treatment, PBMC exposed to soluble GNC-035 for 24 or 48 hours on a monolayer of HUVEC cells, produced significantly greater amounts of IFN-&#947; and IL-6 at concentrations greater than 10 pM. These results indicate GNC-035 has a therapeutic window of activity that is ROR1 dependent, spanning cytolytic activity, and IFN-&#947; release without a production of IL-6 and which is wider than that indicated by Blinatumomab in PBMC.<br \/>Collectively, the GNC-035 represents a class of multi-specific and multi-modal immune cell engagers with potential to mediate ROR1+ cancer regression, overcome TCR-based immune escape and reverse T cell immune suppression in tumor microenvironment. The clinical phase I-b study of GNC-035 is under way in breast cancer and hematologic cancers and the available data exhibit strong signals of efficacy with acceptable tolerability.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,Preclinical testing,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jahan Salar Khalili<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sa Xiao<sup>2<\/sup>, Yi Zhu<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>SystImmune Inc., Redmond, WA,<sup>2<\/sup>Sichuan Baili Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Chengdu, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ea4aa2bd-835f-416f-a7b7-a50a5e68eb82","ControlNumber":"3041","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

The development of GNC-039 is based on the capability of this protein to redirect T cell cytolysis toward the tumor specific antigen EGFRvIII and guide T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Here we demonstrate that the tetraspecific Guidance and Navigation Control (GNC) antibody, GNC-039, binds to EGFRvIII, CD3, PD-L1, and 4-1BB and mediates T cell cytolysis of the human glioblastoma cancer cell line U87 expressing EGFRvIII in the in vitro tumor spheroid model.<br \/>When delivered intravenously, the biodistribution of GNC-039 is an important factor in the development of this intracranial tumor targeting biologic. To better understand the biodistribution of GNC-039, Orthotopic Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) models of Glioma were utilized and vivo-tag680XL-labelled GNC-039 was evaluable by total flux in the Brain area. Multiple IV infusions of GNC-039 were carried out over the study period (29 Days). Groups received either GNC-039 (n=5), GNC-039 with engrafted PBMC (n=5), Temozolomide(n=5), or Vehicle (n=5). The PDX model was sensitive to Temozolomide, 0\/5 mice residual tumor, medial overall survival (mOS) of 15 days. In the Vehicle treatment group, 5\/5 mice had residual tumor, mOS was 26 days. Mice receiving GNC-039 without PBMC, could partially respond to the treatment, in this group 3\/5 animal had residual brain tumors by end of study, but with only a mOS of 15 days. In these animals, the GNC-039 accumulated in the brain region to its maximal level by the third dose on Day 7 and stayed consistently at that level for the duration of the study period. However, in the mouse group with engraft PBMC, the level of GNC-039 in the brain region could exceed that of the drug when infused alone. Mice receiving GNC-039 with engrafted PBMC completely responded to treatment, 5\/5 mice in the group had no residual brain tumor, and a mOS of 20 days. In the presence of the engrafted PBMC, the increased level of GNC-039 in the brain region was delayed compared with treatment in the absence of PBMC. As a point of comparison, the Day 7 levels from GNC-039 treatment alone were not reached until Day 15 in presence of PBMC. However, beyond this timepoint, the level of GNC-039 in the brain region was significantly increased due to the engrafted PBMC.<br \/>Collectively this data indicates the functionality of GNC-039 as a multi-specific T cell engager with the potential to target EGFRvIII+ cancer cell cytolysis in primary brain disease.

Here we demonstrate that a Guidance and Navigation Control (GNC) tetra-specific antibody, GNC-038, binds to CD19, CD3, PD-L1, and 4-1BB and mediates cytolysis of human leukemia and lymphoma cells by T cells.<br \/>Redirected T cell cytolysis (RTCC) occurs in the presence of GNC-038 (Emfizatamab), resulting in the killing of CD19+ leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. The cytolytic functions induced by GNC-038 are similar to Blinatumomab in vitro, as indicated by T cell degranulation and production of IFN-gamma. Human T cells in PBMC exposed to GNC-038 in vitro proliferate in a dose-dependent fashion. Proliferation is further enhanced upon rechallenge with leukemic target cells. Proliferation of T cells from individuals with higher % PD-1+ and Effector polarized compartments is enhanced by GNC-038 compared to Blinatumomab. To evaluate the contribution of each binding domain of GNC-038 in mediating RTCC function, versions of GNC-038 were prepared, replacing each antigen binding domain with anti-FITC binding domains. Under assay conditions using PBMC for RTCC toward the CD19+ target cell line Nalm-6, the results demonstrate the contribution of each domain to the overall, anti-leukemic cytolytic activity.<br \/>To evaluate the potential for GNC-038 to mediate cytokine release syndrome, the molecule is evaluated in soluble, and plate bound formats in the presence of PBMC and CD19+ leukemic targets cells. In comparison to Blinatumomab, the production of cytokines is comparable, with some notable differences. PBMC exposed to soluble GNC-038 for 48 hours produced more IFN-&#947;, IL-2 and TNF-&#945;, while showing no significant difference in production of IL-6. Based on these results, the primary indicator of CRS, IL-6, does not suggest increased risk compared to Blinatumomab, while the type of T cell activity induced by GNC-038 in PBMC with leukemia cells is distinct.<br \/>Collectively, the GNC-038 represents a class of multi-specific and multi-modal immune cell engagers with potential to mediate CD19+ cancer killing, while also increasing the T cell compartment&#8217;s therapeutic potential to respond to T cell redirection upon subsequent cycles of therapy. The clinical phase I-b study of GNC-038 is under way and the available data exhibit strong signals of efficacy with acceptable tolerability.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,Preclinical testing,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jahan Salar Khalili<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sa Xiao<sup>2<\/sup>, Yi Zhu<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>SystImmune Inc., Redmond, WA,<sup>2<\/sup>Sichuan Baili Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Chengdu, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b0dccd61-93ee-41cb-8400-e50ca0b15bf7","ControlNumber":"2972","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.
