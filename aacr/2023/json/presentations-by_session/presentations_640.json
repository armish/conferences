[{"Abstract":"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly infiltrative brain cancer with a dismal prognosis. Conventional treatment using surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy (usually temozolomide) invariably fails. GBM microtubes, which are ultra-long membrane-enclosed protrusions, are associated with therapy resistance and are believed to function by forming multicellular communication networks. Growth-associated protein GAP43 is an important protein for GBM microtube formation.<br \/>Although lipids are important for GBM progression, the roles of lipid chaperones such as the fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) are not well understood. FABPs are involved in fatty acid uptake from the microenvironment and intracellular transport of fatty acids. Brain fatty acid binding protein (FABP7) is highly expressed and is associated with a poor prognosis in GBM. FABP7 levels increase in therapy-resistant GBM cells, suggesting that FABP7 provides a cancer cell survival advantage when GBMs are treated with conventional therapy. FABP7 has a high affinity for polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and omega-6 arachidonic acid (AA), both of which are abundant in brain. Previous studies have shown a correlation between FABP7 expression, increased neural stem cell properties, and increased cell migration in glioblastoma cells, especially when FABP7 is bound to AA. We have recently found that FABP7 is expressed in microtubes, leading to the hypothesis that FABP7 along with its fatty acid ligands can be transported to sites distant from the main tumor mass through these connecting tubes. We are studying the mechanism of action of FABP7 in microtubes by: (i) examining the effect of DHA and AA, as well as FABP7 inhibition on microtube formation and cell migration, and (ii) using both neurosphere cultures and animal models of glioblastoma to investigate the pathways that are activated by FABP7. Our results to date support the use of FABP7 inhibitors to sensitize therapy-resistant cells as part of the standard-of-care for the treatment of GBM patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,FABP,Microtube,Fatty acids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Won-Shik Choi<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Caitlin Mak<sup><\/sup>, John  M.

Among the multiple mechanisms behind the acquisition of drug resistance, metabolic plasticity is receiving increasing attention. Recent proteomic and transcriptomic studies identified metabolic enzymes as potential targets for overcoming the resistance. Yet, these studies mainly focused on differentially expressed genes and overlooked the complexity of the metabolic network, especially its ability to reorganize the metabolic state in response to gene downregulation. Here, we employ the genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) to simulate the metabolic flow and identify candidates that can act as a metabolic switch for drug resistance. Using adriamycin- and paclitaxel-resistant MCF-7 breast cancer cells as model systems, we perform proteomics analysis followed by GEM construction to analyze the differential metabolic flow in the resistant cells. Moreover, we perform GEM simulations after individually knocking out every metabolic enzyme and identify a metabolic switch whose knockout restores the metabolic state of drug-sensitive MCF-7 cells. Notably, downregulating the candidate metabolic switch predicted by our model results in sensitization to the drug. We further show that the cotreatment of adriamycin or paclitaxel with a small chemical inhibitor of the metabolic switch synergistically induces cell death in drug-resistant cells. Collectively, our study demonstrates the application of GEM simulation and subsequent modulation of metabolic state as a strategy to restore drug sensitivity to overcome drug-resistant cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Systems biology,Metabolism,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>JinA Lim<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hae Deok Jung<sup>1<\/sup>, Kyung-min Lee<sup>2<\/sup>, Moonhyeon Jeon<sup>1<\/sup>, Han Suk Ryu<sup>3<\/sup>, Hyun Uk Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Yoosik Kim<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Chemical and biomolecular engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Center for Medical Innovation, Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Pathology, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"53f87739-7ead-4e7f-bd03-4b65f312b11d","ControlNumber":"5916","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

In addition, application of TTFields to glioblastoma cells has been shown to increase cell membrane permeability. The aim of the current study was to examine whether this mechanism is relevant in other tumor types, and may be leveraged to facilitate cellular internalization of the anticancer agent doxorubicin (DOX).<br \/>Methods: Lung fibroblast (MRC-5), brain endothelial (HBMVEC), and several cancer cell lines - breast mammary carcinoma (4T1), breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), and uterine sarcoma (MES-SA) - were treated with TTFields (100-400 kHz, 1.7 V\/cm RMS) using the inovitro<sup>TM<\/sup> system. Intracellular accumulation of 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) was measured to determine membrane permeability, and cell counts were examined to evaluate cytotoxicity. To examine the kinetics and reversibility of the phenomenon, 7-AAD was added at different time points following TTFields application initiation or termination. TTFields were also applied together with DOX to DOX-sensitive and matched DOX-resistant 4T1 cells, followed by flow cytometry examination of DOX accumulation and cytotoxicity measurements. Mice orthotopically inoculated with 4T1 cells were treated with TTFields for 72 h and concomitant DOX injected 24 h before treatment cessation. DOX florescence was measured by flow cytometry in single-cell tumor suspension and by whole tumor <i>in vivo<\/i> imaging system (IVIS).<br \/>Results: TTFields increased intracellular accumulation of 7-AAD specifically in the cancer cell lines, with no such effect seen on the non-cancer MRC-5 and HBMVEC cells. In 4T1 cells, maximal TTFields-induced cellular permeability was recorded with 300 kHz TTFields, whereas highest TTFields-induced cytotoxicity was observed at 150 kHz. TTFields application allowed for DOX accumulation to the same extent in both DOX-resistant and DOX-sensitive cells, and sensitized both cell types to DOX cytotoxicity. <i>In vivo<\/i>, a 2- to 3-fold higher DOX accumulation was seen in tumors isolated from mice treated with TTFields relative to control mice.<br \/>Conclusions: TTFields elevated cancer cell permeability, resulting in enhanced cell accumulation of DOX and improved drug efficacy, even in DOX resistant cells.

However, the overall response rate from lenvatinib treatment is only 24.1%, and even the patients who initially respond to this treatment often subsequently acquire therapeutic resistance to this drug. Although the mechanism of lenvatinib resistance remains unclear, recent studies have suggested the involvement of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation, indicating that a combination of lenvatinib and EGFR inhibitors might have potential clinical applications in HCC. Curcumin is one of the most widely studied natural phytochemicals as an anti-cancer compound. Many previous studies have revealed that it also functions as a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets EGFR. Accordingly, herein we hypothesized that the anti-EFGR potential of curcumin might help overcome lenvatinib resistance in HCC.<br \/>Methods: We first developed two lenvatinib-resistant cell lines and performed a series of cell line experiments, including cell proliferation, invasion, sphere formation, and apoptosis assays, to determine the impact of curcumin in overcoming this resistance. We evaluated EGFR and its downstream signaling pathway to clarify its mechanistic role in lenvatinib resistance and its subsequent reversal mediated by curcumin.<br \/>Results: Among five HCC cell lines, the most sensitive and relatively insensitive cells were Huh-7 (IC50: 2.0 &#181;M) and PLC-PRF-5 (IC50: 50.0 &#181;M), respectively. Accordingly, we successfully established lenvatinib-resistant cells, which had significantly higher IC50 concentrations; resistant Huh-7 (IC50: 50.0 &#181;M) and resistant PLC-PRF-5 (IC50: &#62;100.0 &#181;M). We noted that co-administration of curcumin with lenvatinib inhibited cell proliferation and invasion compared to lenvatinib or curcumin monotherapy. Combination therapy also promoted apoptosis in resistant Huh-7 (lenvatinib, curcumin vs. combination (9.7%, 21.8%, vs. 30.2%) and resistant PLC-PRF-5 (12.2%, 23.1%, vs. 38.2%). This combination treatment also significantly diminished the spheroid-forming ability of cancer cells via suppression of cancer stemness markers such as CD44 (p&#60;0.01) and CD133 (p&#60;0.01). EGFR expression was significantly upregulated in resistant cell lines, suggesting that activation of the EGFR signaling cascade might trigger lenvatinib resistance. Following treatment with a curcumin and lenvatinib combination, EGFR expression in resistant cell lines was significantly downregulated, suppressing the PI3K-AKT-mTOR axis in HCC cells.<br \/>Conclusions: We provide the first evidence that curcumin could overcome lenvatinib resistance in HCC cells via suppression of EGFR and its downstream targets, which can offer a novel therapeutic strategy in HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Lenvatinib,EGFR,Curcumin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Katsuki Miyazaki<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yuji Morine<sup>2<\/sup>, Caiming Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Mitsuo Shimada<sup>2<\/sup>, Ajay Goel<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Beckman Research Institute of The City of Hope, Duarte, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Surgery, The University of Tokushima Graduate School, Tokushima, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7682c20a-6a43-434b-9f5c-b63702f709d2","ControlNumber":"3000","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

Advanced GC treatment is mainly based in chemotherapy with Cisplatin (CDDP). Unfortunately, the high recurrence rate of GC is predominantly attributable to chemoresistance. The CCR5\/CCL5 axis, that participates in inflammatory process, has been associated with the development and progression of cancer. However, its role in GC chemoresistance has not been fully elucidated. The objective of this work was to elucidate the role of CCR5\/CCL5 axis on GC chemoresistance cells.<b> <\/b>AGS R-CDDP was established through a method based on stepwise increasing drug doses and characterized by functional assays. RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on Illumina HiSeq 4000. A fold change &#62;2 and <i>P&#60;0.05<\/i> were used as cut-off to choose the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Gene Ontology (GO) and signaling pathways analysis were analyzed by PANTHER. <i>CCL5<\/i> candidate gene was validated by qRT-PCR. Signaling pathways such as STAT3, MAPK and PI3K, associated with cytokines, proliferation and survival were evaluated by western blot assays. Cell viability of CCR5\/CCL5 axis inhibition was evaluated in AGS R-CDDP exposed to Chemokine receptor antagonist (CRA) alone and in combination with CDDP. Characterization studies have effectively demonstrated that AGS R-CDDP is a reliable CDDP-resistant model. Bioinformatics analyses identified a total of 189 DEGs associated mainly to molecular functions (GO) involved in CDDP-resistance. The most enriched signaling pathway was the inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine which could be involved in the development of CDDP resistance in GC. <i>CCL5<\/i> was upregulated in AGS R-CDDP cells. The main signaling pathways associated with CCR5\/CCL5 axis were not activated in resistant GC cells compared parental GC cells.The cytotoxicity assays showed that CRA\/CDDP combination re-sensitized AGS R-CDDP cells, decreasing cell viability.

The DHGP tumours obtain their blood supply by sprouting angiogenesis, whereas the RHGP tumours utilize an alternative vascularisation known as vessel co-option. In vessel co-option, the cancer cells hijack the mature sinusoidal vessels to obtain blood supply. Vessel co-option has been reported as an acquired mechanism of resistance to anti-angiogenic treatment in CRCLM. Herein, we show the connection between serum cholesterol concentration and vessel co-option development in CRCLM. Our clinical data suggested that the elevation of serum cholesterol levels correlates with the risk of developing vessel co-opting tumours. Moreover, inhibition of PCSK9, the key modulator of cholesterol metabolism, significantly attenuated the development of vessel co-opting CRCLM tumours and sensitized the tumours to anti-angiogenic therapy in vivo. Altogether, these data suggest the importance of cholesterol in the development of vessel co-option tumours and propose that inhibiting PCSK9 is a promising strategy to overcome resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy in CRCLM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastatic tumors,Drug resistance,Antiangiogenic therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Miran Rada<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lucyna Krzywon<sup>1<\/sup>, Audrey Kapelanski-Lamoureux<sup>1<\/sup>, Stephanie Petrillo<sup>1<\/sup>, Andrew Reynolds<sup>2<\/sup>, Anthoula Lazaris<sup>1<\/sup>, Nabil Seidah<sup>3<\/sup>, Peter Metrakos<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada,<sup>2<\/sup>AstraZeneca, Cambridge, United Kingdom,<sup>3<\/sup>Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"33b178c3-9feb-4137-b5d6-bf1192913df4","ControlNumber":"5682","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

In this study, we investigate the mechanism of miR-1307-5p in conferring therapeutic refractoriness and demonstrate reversal of cisplatin induced chemoresistance. This study provides a potentially new therapeutic target for treating recurrent oral carcinomas.<br \/>Methods: Expression of miR-1307-5p was validated in OSCC patients (n=86), OECM1 cell line and cisplatin resistant CD44+ subpopulation. miR-1307-5p was knocked down in OECM1 and CD44+ cells and its effect on cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, migration, invasion and sphere forming abilities was measured. We examined the transcriptome of these patients (n=30) and combined this data with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset for target prediction (TargetScan) and network analysis (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis). The hub genes were considered to be potential targets of miR-1307-5p and were validated by luciferase assay and Western Blotting.<br \/>Results: Sequencing analysis revealed exclusive expression of miR-1307-5p in the OSCC patient cohort with significant upregulation in chemo-resistant cases (FC:4.82 &#177; 2.38, p-value:0.01). miR-1307-5p upregulation separated the chemoresistant and remission cohorts (p&#60;0.05). Transfection-mediated silencing of miR-1307-5p in OECM1(FC:0.009 &#177; 1.5, p:0.01) and CD44+ (FC:0.06 &#177; 2.3, p:0.01) cells restrained the cell proliferation rates (p&#60;0.01) and revealed a significant sub G0 population of OECM1 (20&#177;5%) and CD44+(18.7&#177;3%) cells, indicating early apoptosis. A significant Annexin V+ \/PI- population (OECM1: 40%&#177;3.36%; CD44+: 23%&#177;3.36%) confirmed induction of apoptosis, post-silencing. A 2 fold reduction in the sphere-forming ability and invasive potentials of CD44+ cells observed post-knockdown (p&#62;0.05). Combinatorial treatment of cisplatin and miR-1307-5p inhibitor reduced the proliferation rate of CD44+ cells by 66.23% in comparison to standalone treatment of the inhibitor (p:0.034). Thus, indicating role of miR-1307-5p in reversal of chemo-resistance. Gene target identification revealed miR-1307-5p could promote therapeutic refractoriness by suppressing the expression of EHF, which regulates cancer stem cell renewal by targeting Sox-2, Oct-4 and Nanog. Dual-luciferase gene reporter assay revealed direct suppression of EHF by miR-1307-5p. Further, knockdown of miR-1307-5p increased endogenous EHF mRNA and protein expression in cancer cells.<br \/>Conclusion: miR1307-5p downregulates EHF which is an inhibitor of many stemness genes like Sox-2, Oct-4 and Nanog. Knockdown of miR-1307-5p reverses Cisplatin resistance by upregulating EHF thus suppressing the emergence of cancer stem cells in OSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cisplatin resistance,MicroRNA,Cancer stem cells,miR-1307-5p,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Aditi Patel<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Shanaya Patel<sup><\/sup>, Shreya Lotia<sup><\/sup>, Vivek Tanavde<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Ahmedabad University, Ahmedabad, India","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5d495d2a-bef2-4c1f-8304-81572ae397af","ControlNumber":"2783","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

This is largely due to intrinsic or acquired therapy resistance. The current study investigates the potential of a repurposed antimuscarinic overactive bladder drug to resensitize chemotherapy-resistant NSCLC to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis.<br \/>Methods: The chemotherapy drug, docetaxel (DTX), resistant human NSCLC cell cultures (A549<sup>R<\/sup>) were established to recapitulate the clinical emergence of chemoresistance. These cultures were used to harvest total RNA for RNA-seq and qPCR. DTX-induced apoptosis was measured with crystal violet survival assay, colony formation assay, and TUNEL assay. <i>In vivo<\/i> experiments were performed by injecting A549<sup>R<\/sup> cells into the flanks of immunocompromised mice. Mice were treated with various agents, tumor sizes were monitored, and tumor mass was measured at the end of the experiment.<br \/>Results: RNA-seq data of DTX-resistant NSCLC (A549<sup>R<\/sup>) cells show a 13.5-fold increase in expression of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 3 (CHRM3) compared to chemonaive A549 cells which was supported by qPCR analysis (16-fold increase). Oncomine clinical data from TCGA and Bild Lung suggest an increased mortality risk at 3 years is associated with increased CHRM3 expression. <i>In vitro<\/i> survival experimental results show resensitization of A549<sup>R<\/sup> cells to DTX-induced cell death when co-treated with the CHRM3 antagonist, darifenacin. Crystal violet cell survival assays show a 70% reduction in survival when cells are treated with darifenacin + DTX compared to DTX alone. This is supported by colony formation assay results with complete absence of colony growth in the darifenacin + DTX combination therapy group. Furthermore, cells treated with darifenacin + DTX show increased apoptosis measured by TUNEL assay compared to cells treated with DTX alone (% TUNEL positive: DTX alone = 0.9%, darifenacin + DTX = 88%). <i>In vivo<\/i> tumor measurements of injected A549<sup>R<\/sup> cells revealed a 91% decrease in tumor growth in the darifenacin + DTX treated mice compared to the DTX alone treated mice.<br \/>Conclusion: We show that chemoresistant NSCLC has increased expression of CHRM3 which is associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Furthermore, the currently available antimuscarinic, darifenacin, which is used in the clinic to treat overactive bladder, effectively resensitizes DTX-resistant cells to DTX-induced cell death both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. This novel therapy has unique advantages over alternate approaches as it aims to save chemotherapy-eligible patients at multiple levels: 1) to resensitize chemotherapy-resistant tumors, 2) to synergize with chemotherapy for improved efficacy, and 3) to reduce the effective dose of chemotherapy, thus lowering toxic side effects.

Only 15% of EAC patients have a complete histopathological response to standard chemotherapy, indicating the urgent need to identify mechanisms associated with therapeutic resistance for improved therapeutic efficacy and patient outcomes. Herein, we performed transcriptional profiling utilizing tissues collected from EAC patients prior to treatment initiation. First, EAC patients (n=67) were stratified into 5 therapeutic response groups based on the changes in TNM pre- to post-treatment; second, bioinformatic approaches were utilized to identify molecular changes associated with response to treatment and patient survival. Third, we employed OE19 and OE33 human EAC cell lines to investigate the efficacy of cranberry proanthocyanidins (C-PAC), a promising anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer agent which shows synergistic effects with carboplatin in other cancer types, at mitigating molecular pathways which drive therapeutic resistance. Our therapeutic response data set revealed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as a top pathway associated with differential response to therapy and patient survival. Subsequent gene-set enrichment analysis identified that EMT is significantly associated with NF&#954;B and STAT3 signaling pathways, two nodes with documented proinflammatory roles in EAC progression. Deconvolution analysis was conducted further supporting EMT enrichment creates an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment in EAC patients. Next, EAC cell viability, migration and interrogation of EMT signaling proteins were conducted following treatment with paclitaxel and carboplatin (chemo drugs) alone or in combination with C-PAC. Combination treatment of C-PAC and chemo drugs significantly inhibited EAC cell viability and migration capability, compared to cells treated with chemo drugs alone, with synergistic effects observed in OE33 cells. Moreover, combination treatment also significantly decreased NF&#954;B1 expression and expressions of EMT markers and transcription factors (Snail, MMP-2, MMP-9, and Vimentin) whereas cells treated only with chemo drugs showed minimal modulation. Knockdown experiments of NF&#954;B1 using RNA interference are underway to investigate the relationship between canonical NF&#954;B1 signaling and EMT. Primary cell lines and organoids developed from isolated EAC patient tissues will also be used in the future to validate experimental findings. The results suggest C-PAC may be used as a safe and novel therapeutic strategy to improve chemotherapy efficacy targeting EAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Drug resistance,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Proanthocyanidins,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yun Zhang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Katherine  M.

Tumor kinome re-wiring governs drug resistance in resistant cancer cells, which is an obstacle for efficient cancer therapy. Therefore, identification of the kinases critical for this rewiring process in HCC is crucial. Upon mass spectrometry analysis using a lysine-targeted sulfonyl fluoride probe named XO44, CDK6 was identified to be the most upregulated kinase in lenvatinib-resistant HCC cell lines. Lentiviral-based overexpression and knockdown approaches were performed to characterize functional roles of CDK6 in regulation of cancer stemness and lenvatinib resistance. The upregulation of CDK6 in lenvatinib-resistant HCC cells is found to be mediated by the ERK\/YAP signaling cascade. CDK6 is crucial in the regulation of acquired lenvatinib resistance via augmentation of cancer stemness and the overexpression of CDK6 led to poorer patient survival. We identified a novel noncanonical pathway of CDK6 in which it binds and regulates the activity of GSK3&#946;, leading to activation of the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway. CDK6 inhibition by CDK4\/6 inhibitor palbociclib or CDK6 degradation by proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) is highly synergistic with lenvatinib <i>in vitro<\/i>. Interestingly, palbociclib not only exerts the maximal growth suppressive effect with lenvatinib in lenvatinib-resistant HCC xenografts and <i>Trp53<\/i><sup>KO<\/sup>\/<i>MYC<\/i><sup>OE<\/sup>-induced HCC models but also reshapes the tumor immune microenvironment.

The goal of this project is to investigate hallmarks of cancer progression that contribute to temozolomide (TMZ) resistance, a first tine treatment for GBM.<br \/>Two signaling pathways were investigated in TMZ-sensitive and -resistant GBM cell lines and in primary and recurrent patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumor cells by genetically and pharmacologically inhibiting methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A) and adenosylhomocysteinase (AHCY). Cell growth and survival were assessed by measuring protein expression of proliferation, oxidative stress and cell cycle arrest markers. EPIC array analysis and targeted bisulfite sequencing were conducted to identify changes in genome-wide and specific CpG island methylation. The Seahorse XF Analyzer measured mitochondrial respiratory capacity and oxidative metabolism.

Thus, more effective treatments are needed to prolong the survival of MM patients. Anti-apoptotic myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) overexpression is correlated with poor prognosis and drug resistance in MM. Nonetheless, there is a lack of effective Mcl-1 inhibitors. To address this unmet clinical need, we developed KS18, a Mcl-1 inhibitor. We generated respective resistant cells to investigate whether KS18 may overcome acquired resistance against various available drugs in the clinic including bortezomib, venetoclax, and ABT-737. KS18 was effective against all MM cells with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values ranging between 1.5 to 2.5&#181;M. KS18 showed significant Mcl-1 inhibition in various MM cells including resistant cells. Importantly, KS18 re-sensitizes resistant cells to bortezomib and other chemotherapeutic drugs.

Cisplatin (CDDP) is the most used drug in the chemotherapy of advanced GC. However, CDDP resistance reduces GC survival. The CCR5\/CCL5 axis has been associated with GC development, but its role in CDDP resistance in GC has not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of CCR5\/CCL5 axis blockade by a chemokine receptor antagonist (CRA), alone and in combination with CDDP, on <i>in vitro<\/i> and 3D tumorid models from AGS R-CDDP cells.<br \/>Methodology: AGS R-CDDP cells (CDDP-resistant human gastric adenocarcinoma cells) were previously established using a stepwise drug dosing protocol and characterized. <i>CCL5<\/i> was selected through transcriptomic analysis and its expression level was validated by qRT-PCR. Cytotoxicity assays were determined by using MTT. Apoptosis and cell cycle assays were evaluated by flow cytometry. Tumoroid formation was performed from AGS R-CDDP cells in low adhesion plates (Nunclon<sup>TM<\/sup>Sphera<sup>TM<\/sup>). After 10 days in culture, tumoroid &#62;150 &#181;m in diameter were scored and pharmacological stimuli were added on days 14, 17 and 20. CRA was used alone and in combination with CDDP in all assays.<br \/>Results: CRA\/CDDP combination triggered a re-sensitized phenotype in AGS R-CDDP cells, decreasing cell viability but not increasing apoptosis compared to independent treatments. AGS R-CDDP cells treated with CRA\/CDDP were mainly arrested in<i> S<\/i> phase. <i>CCL5<\/i> showed a decrease in mRNA levels after the CRA\/CDDP combination compared to separate treatments. AGS R-CDDP cells showed a higher potential in the ability to form tumoroids compared to AGS WT<i> <\/i>cells. Finally, CRA\/CDDP combination inhibited tumoroid formation compared to independent treatments.<br \/>Discussion and Conclusion: <i>CCL5<\/i> showed a decrease in mRNA levels after the CRA\/CDDP combination, possibly correlating with allosteric inhibition of the CCR5 receptor. CRA\/CDDP combination has a synergic effect that sensitizes AGS R-CDDP cells and inhibits tumoroid formation. This combination could be used as a potential coadjuvant in GC therapy allowing to reduce the doses of CDDP and therefore to reduce side effects.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Chemokine receptor,Gastric cancer,Cisplatin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Bárbara Mora-Lagos<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, María Elena Reyes<sup>2<\/sup>, Lorena Lobos-Gonzalez<sup>3<\/sup>, Matías del Campo<sup>3<\/sup>, Carmen Gloria Ili<sup>2<\/sup>, Kurt Buchegger<sup>4<\/sup>, Yuselin Mora<sup>5<\/sup>, Louise Zanella<sup>5<\/sup>, Ismael Riquelme<sup>1<\/sup>, Priscilla Brebi<sup>5<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Instituto de Ciencias Biomédicas, Universidad Autónoma de Chile, Temuco, Chile,<sup>2<\/sup>Laboratory of Integrative Biology, CEMT-BIOREN, UFRO, Universidad de La Frontera, Temuco, Chile,<sup>3<\/sup>Centro de Medicina Regenerativa, Facultad de Medicina-Clínica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Basic Sciences, Universidad de La Frontera, Temuco, Chile,<sup>5<\/sup>Laboratory of Integrative Biology, CEMT-BIOREN, Universidad de La Frontera, Temuco, Chile","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7ce13856-6795-4f66-baad-ede04f0298c6","ControlNumber":"4519","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>B.

Advances in treatment are stymied by the limited number of efficacious chemotherapeutic agents. The most common drug used to treat colorectal cancer is 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), but less than 10% of mucinous tumors respond to this drug. The production of mucus has been theorized to limit the uptake of chemotherapeutic agents via charge repulsion and size exclusion, thereby promoting chemo-resistance and driving poor outcomes.<br \/><b>Hypothesis<\/b>: We predict that mucin-degrading microbes secrete glycosyl hydrolase enzymes which cleave mucin glycans and promote the uptake of chemotherapeutic agents and enhance cell death.<br \/><b>Methods &#38; Results<\/b>: We queried the human gut microbiota and identified multiple diverse microbes which encode enzymes to degrade mucin glycans. Among the mucin-degrading bacteria, we found that <i>Bifidobacterium bifidum<\/i> harbored one of the most extensive repertoires of mucin-degrading enzymes. <i>B. bifidum<\/i><i> <\/i>was grown in a chemically defined medium with or without porcine intestinal mucus and the secreted products were then added to mucus-producing adenocarcinoma cell lines: HT29-MTX and T84 cells.

Supernatant without mucus also promoted 5-FU mediated cell death; although to a lesser degree than supernatant from cultures incubated with mucus. Gene expression analysis and immunostaining revealed decreased MUC13 gene expression and protein in <i>B. bifidum<\/i> metabolite treated cell lines compared to media controls. In contrast, we found that secreted products from <i>B. dentium<\/i>, which is unable to degrade mucus, had no effect on 5-FU induced cell death.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our data suggests that <i>B. bifidum<\/i> elicits chemo-sensitivity via the production of mucin-degrading enzymes, which cleave negatively charged sialic acid, increasing the activity of 5-FU in these cancers as well as by lowering the expression of adherent mucins. This work points to a novel role of mucin-degrading microbes to promote 5-FU penetration of mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma. This strategy has the potential to provide unique treatment strategies for patients with mucinous colorectal cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Cell death,Chemotherapy,Chemoresistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Leah K.

Previous studies in our group found despite dysregulation of apoptotic pathway in resistant DLBCL, upregulation in glycose metabolism and energetic ATP production were also found in r\/r DLBCL. Therefore, decreasing or blockage ATP production may provide a novel method to overcome resistance in lymphoma. ATP\/ADP is hydrolyzed into AMP by NTPDases, and AMP into adenosine and phosphate by ecto-5&#8217;-nucleotidase, known as CD73. CD73 is the rate limiting enzyme anchored the surface of tumor and immune cell. The expression level of CD73 on the tumor was reported significantly associated with inferior prognosis in variety of cancers. Moreover, expression level of CD73 on immune cell has been shown immunosuppression in multiple cancers. Targeting CD73 by monoclonal antibody or small inhibitor currently underwent multiple clinical trials. However, the role of CD73 in r\/r DLBCL and the relationship between CD73 and CD20 have not been explored.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Germinal center B-cell like, activated B-cell like lymphoma, Burkitt&#8217;s lymphoma and rituximab resistant cell lines generated in our lab were used. Surface expression of CD73 and CD20 were determined by staining anti-CD73 FITC and anti-CD20 Per-cy5.5 antibodies and running flow cytometry. The expression levels of CD73 and CD20 were detected by media fluorescence index (MFI). The CD20\/CD73 ratio was calculated by CD73 MFI\/CD20 MFI.<br \/><b>Result:<\/b> Previously our group found surface CD20 levels exhibited a linear correlation with rituximab induced cellular mediated cytotoxicity. The CD20 MFI of germinal center B-cell like, activated B-cell like lymphoma, Burkitt&#8217;s lymphoma and rituximab resistant cell lines were: DHL4 8652, DOHH2 6472, TMD8 3981, RL 2849, Raji 2011, U2932 604, RL 4RH 599 and Raji 4RH 576. The higher MFI of CD20, the more sensitive to rituximab treatment. Here we discovered that the surface level of CD73 had an inverse correlation with CD20 level in these cell lines. In detail, CD73 MFI were: DHL4 464, DOHH2 387, TMD8 363, RL 299, Raji 611, U2932 486, RL 4RH 631 and Raji 4RH 702. The CD20\/CD73 ratio of cell lines from high to low were DOHH2, DHL4, TMD8, RL, Raji, U2932, Raji 4RH and RL 4RH, respectively. This CD20\/CD73 ratio in each of cell lines was found more straight forward to represent the sensitivity of rituximab or chemo drug treatment in vitro condition.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our study was first time to reveal the association between CD20\/CD73 ratio and immune-chemo response in lymphoma cell lines, especially in resistant lymphoma in vitro condition.

Overall cure rates remain low due to eventual development of resistance. Osimertinib is a third-generation EGFR inhibitor that overcomes T790M-mediated resistance to earlier generation EGFRi. However, resistance to osimertinib has also emerged through mechanisms that are EGFR-dependent and EGFR-independent. To uncover novel strategies to overcome osimertinib resistance, we explored androgen receptor (AR) antagonists in combination with osimertinib as recent studies have demonstrated AR inhibition enhanced TKI-targeted therapy. For these experiments, we utilized lab-derived osimertinib-resistant PC9-AR and HCC827-AR NSCLC cell lines and matching parental lines in both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in<\/i> <i>vivo<\/i> model systems. Clonogenic assays revealed that darolutamide in combination with osimertinib synergistically suppressed clonal growth in resistant cell lines. Similar results were observed with the combination of enzalutamide and osimertinib. Given this result, we next wanted to establish whether the promising <i>in vitro <\/i>activity of this combination translates into antitumor efficacy <i>in vivo<\/i>. Mice bearing either HCC827AR or PC9AR xenografts were treated orally daily with both drugs. At the doses administered, neither drug alone had antitumor activity. However, the combination significantly delayed tumor growth by more than 60%. We confirmed this ability to reverse resistance as a class effect using a different AR antagonist, enzalutamide in PC9AR-bearing mice. Significant tumor growth inhibition was observed with the combination of enzalutamide and osimertinib. To investigate the mechanism by which this combination may reverse osimertinib-resistance, RNA-seq studies were performed following drug exposure <i>in<\/i> <i>vitro<\/i> using parental and resistant cell lines under various experimental conditions. Comparison of gene expression profiles between parental and resistant cell lines under different therapeutic pressure and pathway enrichment analysis revealed important differentially expressed genes pointing plausible activated pathways that underline osimertinib resistance.

The primary systemic treatment for TNBC remains to be chemotherapy. However, patients frequently develop resistance to conventional chemotherapy, greatly compromising the anti-tumor effects of chemodrugs. Therefore, this study is aimed to enhance the effects of chemotherapy. The RNA-binding protein Hu antigen R (HuR) plays an important role in chemotherapy resistance. HuR post-transcriptionally regulates the stability of the target mRNA by binding to the U- or AU-rich elements (ARE) mainly in the 3&#8217; untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA. In most cases, the binding stabilizes mRNA, thereby enhancing the translation of the encoded protein, many of which are implicated in multiple cancer hallmarks, including chemoresistance. The overexpression of HuR, and accumulated cytoplasmic expression, are reported to be related to chemoresistance in many types of cancer cells. We hypothesized that inhibition of HuR function by disrupting its interaction with mRNA can accelerate the decay of mRNA and thus reduce the translation of proteins contributing to chemoresistance.Previously, our lab reported a small molecule HuR inhibitor, KH-3, which potently inhibits HuR function by disrupting the HuR-mRNA interactions. To test our hypothesis, we utilized KH-3 as a tool compound to assess whether HuR inhibition enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy for TNBC cells. We generated a cell sub-line (231-TR) derived from the human TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 with acquired resistance against docetaxel (TXT). Compared with the parental cell line, 231-TR exhibited similar sensitivity to KH-3 in the MTT-based cytotoxicity assay and the colony formation assay. The in vitro and in vivo combination of KH-3 and TXT synergized in inhibiting cell proliferation and tumor growth of multiple TNBC cell lines. Regarding mechanisms of action, the apoptosis pathway was downregulated and the Wnt signaling pathway was upregulated in 231-TR cells. KH-3 treatment downregulated &#946;-Catenin, involved in promoting cell proliferation, in a time and dose-dependent manner. KH-3 was also identified to induce apoptosis cell death via inhibiting the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2. The cell cycle analysis revealed that KH-3 treatment caused the S phase accumulation. Therefore, the cell proliferation inhibition by KH-3 results from a combination of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.

Novel therapeutics, such as Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) ligand therapy, are emerging as effective treatment strategies for metastatic prostate cancer. However, neuroendocrine differentiated (NED) metastatic PCa, which lacks the PSMA antigen, is deprived of effective biomarkers for disease treatment. Magmas, a 13.8 kDa mitochondrial protein, imports nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins into the mitochondrial matrix. Magmas is overexpressed in several aggressive tumors, such as breast cancer, glioblastoma, and prostate cancer. When overexpressed, Magmas plays a role as a cytoprotective protein by acting as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger that maintains sufficient ROS levels to promote cell proliferation, but below the threshold levels that could lead to apoptosis. This study was designed to investigate the pro-survival and therapy-resistance functions of Magmas in PCa cells expressing NED markers. Predictively, we observed that the docetaxel (DTX)-resistant PC3-DR and DU145-DR PCa cell lines expressed significantly higher levels of Magmas compared to their drug-sensitive parental cell lines. We hypothesized that inhibiting Magmas reduces the aggressive properties of highly proliferative DTX- resistant metastatic PCa cell lines and re-sensitize them to DTX. Magmas knockdown in DTX-sensitive and DTX-resistant PC3 and DU145 cells in the presence of increasing DTX treatments enhanced sensitivity to DTX. Consistent with these results, pharmacological inhibition of Magmas with the novel BT#9 inhibitor in combination with increasing DTX concentrations also enhanced sensitivity to DTX in these cell lines. Additional studies using clonogenic assays, cell migration\/invasion assays, and tumorsphere formation assays are currently underway to further establish Magmas as a potential therapeutic target to attenuate the aggressive properties of chemoresistant PCa cells. Lastly, we will investigate the diagnostic potential of Magmas as a biomarker for NED and BT#9 as an imaging\/therapeutic-specific agent for NED.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemoresistance,Mitochondria,Prostate cancer,Neuroendocrine differentiation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alfonso  M.

Accordingly, we established 5FU+CDDP resistant intestinal subtype GC patient-derived organoid lines. JAK\/STAT signaling and its downstream, adenosine deaminases acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1), are shown to be concomitantly upregulated in the resistant lines. ADAR1 was demonstrated to confer chemoresistance and self-renewal in an RNA editing-dependent manner. WES-seq coupled with RNA-seq identified enrichment of hyperedited lipid metabolism genes in the resistant lines. Mechanistically, ADAR1-mediated A-to-I editing on 3&#8217;UTR of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1) increased binding of KH domain-containing, RNA-binding, signal transduction-associated 1 (KHDRBS1), thereby augmenting SCD1 mRNA stability. Consequently, SCD1 facilitates lipid droplet formation to alleviate chemotherapy-induced ER stress and enhances self-renewal through increasing &#946;-catenin expression. Pharmacological inhibition of SCD1 abrogated chemoresistance and tumor-initiating cell frequency. Clinically, high proteomic level of ADAR1 and SCD1, or high SCD1 editing\/ADAR1 mRNA signature score predicts a worse prognosis.

However, more than 50% of patients develop Docetaxel Resistance (DoceR) within three years of treatment. It also shows severe adverse effects that lead to dose reduction and treatment failure. Thus, targeting the underlying mechanism of DoceR could improve survival benefits for CRPC patients. In this study, we identified leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) as a candidate for DoceR. We targeted it with EC914, a first-in-class oral small molecule, to overcome DoceR in CRPC.<br \/>Methods: We developed three DoceR (PC3-R60, 22Rv1-R110, and LNCaP(C-83)-R50) isogeneic sub-lines by chronic Docetaxel treatment for six months. We analyzed those cell lines for drug resistance markers using RT-PCR and western blot. We evaluated the effect of EC914 in overcoming DoceR using cytotoxicity assay in Incucyte&#174; live imaging system, colony survival assay, apoptosis induction, and cell cycle arrest using FACS analysis. RNA-seq analysis revealed molecular pathways related to EC914-mediated Docetaxel- sensitivity. In addition, we utilized RT-PCR and western blot analysis to examine EC914-responsive cancer stem cell (CSC) and LIFR\/STAT pathway-related genes and proteins. Finally, we adopted human and mouse syngeneic PCa cells and patient-derived xenograft models to test the <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy of EC914 in combination with Docetaxel.<br \/>Results: LIFR showed significantly high mRNA and protein expression in Docetaxel resistant PCa cell model. EC914 combined with Docetaxel reduced considerably <i>in vitro<\/i> tumorigenicity (proliferation (p&#60;0 01), colony growth (p&#60;0 01)), induced apoptosis (p&#60;0 01), and arrested cells in the G2\/M and S phase (p&#60;0 01) of the cell cycle. The combination also affected the CSC population and markers expression in DoceR PCa cells. Expression of cleaved caspase 3, caspase 9, and PARP-1 further validated apoptosis induction. Global transcriptome analysis identified EC914 treatment targets c-Myc pathway enrichment. Specifically, we found sixteen c-Myc pathway-related genes downregulated significantly (p&#60;0 05) in transcriptomic and qRT-PCR validation. Knockdown of <i>LIFR<\/i> reduces phospho-STAT3 and phospho c-Myc without altering total STAT and c-Myc proteins. Mice subcutaneous implantation of human (p&#60;0 05) and mouse (p&#60;0 05) syngeneic PCa cells and patient-derived tissue (p=0 003) reduced xenograft tumor growth upon treatment with EC914 combined with Docetaxel.<br \/>Conclusion: For the first time, we identified c-Myc pathway genes as potential LIFR signaling targets to overcome docetaxel resistance. Our findings support a new role and mechanism(s) of LIFR in CRPC and could inhibit MYC-addicted tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Drug resistance,Docetaxel,LIFR (Leukemia inhibitory factor receptor),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sushanta Halder<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sakthivel Muniyan<sup>1<\/sup>, Ramakanth Chirravuri-Venkata<sup>1<\/sup>, Rama Krishna Nimmakayala<sup>1<\/sup>, Palanisamy Nallasamy<sup>1<\/sup>, Hareesh B.

Up to 40% of all DLBCL patients experience treatment failure after the standard immunochemotherapy R-CHOP. Defining novel therapeutic strategies is therefore a pressing need. Reduced acetylation at histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27ac) represents a pathogenetic hallmark of DLBCL and selective histone deacetylase 3 inhibition (HDAC3i) has recently emerged as a viable strategy to reverse abnormal epigenetic signatures and induce strong anti-tumor effects by increasing H3K27ac. Despite this compelling rationale, the overall response remains suboptimal, suggesting unrecognized mechanisms of resistance. To unbiasedly uncover sensitizers, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen and identified knockout (KO) of the top candidate <i>GNAS<\/i> (encoding G-protein &#945; subunit, G&#945;s) for sensitizing resistant DLBCL cells to HDAC3i. The sensitizing effects on reduced viable cell number were only observed in <i>GNAS<\/i> KO cells treated with HDAC3i, but not in the control cells (&#8220;synthetic lethality&#8221;). We have validated this sensitizing phenotype in multiple resistant cell lines including three human DLBCL cell lines and one mouse B-cell lymphoma cell line. Interestingly, we showed that the sensitization was not related to the canonical G-protein functions but to novel regulatory mechanisms in viral mimicry activation and chromatin modification. Compared with the control conditions, the interaction between <i>GNAS<\/i> KO and HDAC3i has been linked with differential chromatin accessibility and endogenous retrovirus expression, upregulated double-stranded RNA expression, and increased phosphorylation of TBK1 whose activation plays a vital role in antiviral immune responses. Strikingly, a selective TBK1 degrader completely and specifically rescued the sensitizing phenotype in <i>GNAS<\/i> KO cells treated with HDAC3i, confirming the critical role of TBK1 in inducing sensitization. Furthermore, we identified potential immune interactions by exploring the clinical data from tumor samples of 309 DLBCL patients that low <i>GNAS<\/i> expression was correlated with cytokine and inflammatory signaling as well as stromal cell interactions in the tumor microenvironment, altogether associated with longer overall survival. These observations were aligned with our results in the mouse xenograft and allograft tumor experiments that <i>GNAS<\/i> KO with\/without HDAC3i led to differential phenotypes. Overall, our research uncovers novel immunomodulating activities for potentiating the efficacy of epigenetic agents in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This expands our understanding of novel interactions between immune and epigenetic regulation in lymphoma biology and provides new therapeutic opportunities for patients with resistant lymphoma who have poor prognoses and limited treatment options.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Epigenetics,Immunomodulation,CRISPR\/Cas9,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Michael Y.

Therapy-resistant cancer cells are able to evade the effect of cancer drugs, resulting in highly aggressive clones that can cause poor long-term prognosis. Neuropilin-2 (NRP2) is a cell surface receptor that acts as a co-receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and has been shown to be associated with therapy resistance. The VEGF-C signaling pathway has also been linked to chemoresistance in several cancer types including breast, bladder, and gastric cancer. Previously we have shown that ATYR2810&#8212;a highly specific humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks NRP2\/VEGF-C signaling&#8212;sensitizes triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a highly aggressive and chemoresistant subtype of breast cancer, to chemotherapy and targeted anti-VEGF therapy both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. In this study we examined the role of enhanced VEGF-C signaling in tumor growth and therapeutic resistance, and the ability of ATYR2810 to neutralize these effects using <i>in vivo <\/i>models for lung and kidney cancers.<br \/>Results: We generated a stable VEGF-C overexpressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line and found that tumor growth was enhanced by increased VEGF-C signaling. Importantly, ATYR2810 monotherapy counteracted this VEGF-C-driven enhanced tumor growth as tumor growth inhibition was increased in the VEGF-C overexpressing tumors compared to control tumors. Further, VEGF-C overexpression was also found to enhance resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy in this model. However, sensitivity to chemotherapy was restored when ATYR2810 was used in combination with cisplatin. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the use of sunitinib&#8212;a small molecule inhibitor that inhibits the signaling of several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs)&#8212;has reportedly been associated with the upregulation of VEGF-C and NRP2 expression as well as increased metastasis. In line with this, we found that the use of sunitinib leads to increased levels of circulating VEGF-C in the serum of ccRCC xenograft mice. The use of ATYR2810 in combination with sunitinib was found to act synergistically to inhibit tumor growth in ccRCC xenograft tumors leading to complete tumor regression in some animals.<br \/>Conclusions: Here we demonstrate that high levels of VEGF-C expression increase tumor dependency on the VEGF-C\/NRP2 signaling axis thereby promoting tumor growth and chemoresistance. ATYR2810 counteracts the aggressive traits of tumors expressing high levels of VEGF-C resulting in enhanced tumor growth inhibition and sensitivity to both chemotherapy and targeted therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuropilins,Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),Therapy resistance,Monoclonal antibodies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alison Barber<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Zhiwen Xu<sup><\/sup>, Lisa Eide<sup><\/sup>, Clara Polizzi<sup><\/sup>, Max Pastenes<sup><\/sup>, Lauren Guy<sup><\/sup>, Jasmine Stamps<sup><\/sup>, Kristina Hamel<sup><\/sup>, Zachary Fogassy<sup><\/sup>, Sofia Klopp-Savino<sup><\/sup>, Esther Chong<sup><\/sup>, Yang Qing<sup><\/sup>, Lara Glendening<sup><\/sup>, Christoph Burkart<sup><\/sup>, Leslie Nangle<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>aTyr Pharma, San Diego, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"723cebdf-039c-4c97-aae0-b2ba075aea4f","ControlNumber":"4014","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;A.

Adaptation to therapy involves co-action of functionally related proteins that together activate cell survival programs and compensate for the therapeutic impact. Oncogenic dependencies to such adaptive events, however, can generate new therapeutic vulnerabilities that can be targeted with drug combinations. The precision medicine approaches in which targeted drugs are matched to pre-existing genomic aberrations fail to address the adaptive responses and resulting vulnerabilities. Here, we provide the mathematical formulation, implementation and validation of the TargetScore method. The TargetScore identifies collective adaptive responses to targeted interventions as concurrent changes of phospho-proteins that are connected within a signaling network. Based on the adaptive responses, the method predicts drug-induced vulnerabilities. Using TargetScore, we inferred the adaptive responses with short-term (i.e., days) stress and long-term (i.e., months) acquired resistance to inhibitors of anti-apoptotic mediators, MCL1 and BCL2. With experiments guided by the predictions, we identified synergistic interactions between inhibitors of PARP, SHP2, and MCL1 in breast cancer cells. TargetScore is readily applicable to existing precision oncology efforts by matching targeted drug combinations to emerging molecular signatures under therapeutic stress.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Resistance,Signaling pathways,Mcl-1,PARP inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Augustin Luna<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Heping Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Gonghong Yan<sup>2<\/sup>, Xubin Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Ozgun Babur<sup>3<\/sup>, Gordon Mills  B.

Arginine deprivation using pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20) is a novel treatment for mesothelioma deficient in the arginine biosynthetic enzyme ASS1. However, resistance to ADI-PEG20 in MPM is a significant problem and is characterized in part by reprogramming of the urea and polyamine metabolism pathway (Locke et al., 2016). We sought to identify a targeted metabolism-based therapy to overcome the emerging resistance and increase the efficiency of ADI-PEG20 treatment for patients with MPM.<br \/>New models of ADI-PEG20 resistance were generated by constant exposure of MPM cell lines to arginine deprivation for 6 months. ADI-PEG20 resistant and sensitive MPM cell lines were treated with a panel of polyamine targeting molecules. Metabolome alterations were studied by targeted metabolomics and glucose flux analyses.<br \/>Our results confirmed the up-regulation of ASS1 expression from (50 to 3000-fold) alongside upregulation of polyamine catabolism and upon generation of ADI-PEG20 resistance. Treatment of ADI-PEG20 resistant cell lines with a range of different polyamine inhibitors demonstrated that ADI-PEG20 resistant cell lines were significantly more sensitive to the spermidine-analogue GC7 than their respective ASS1-ve parental cell lines. Moreover, the combination of GC7 and ADI-PEG20 prevented the emergence of resistant cells in vitro. We observed a significant synergistic effect of GC7 and ADI-PEG20 in both ASS1-ve and ASS1+ve cell lines in 2D and 3D cell culture models as well as in our mice in vivo model. Metabolomics analysis revealed that GC7 treatment significantly impaired the TCA cycle. We hypothesize that GC7 is repurposing the fate of Acetyl-CoA to polyamine catabolism therefore shutting down the TCA cycle. Our findings provide novel insights into a polyamine targeted therapy that may prevent resistance to ADI-PEG20 treatment in MPM and related arginine-auxotrophic cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Arginine deprivation,Polyamines,Drug resistance,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Joséphine Carpentier<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Peter  W.

However, most ovarian cancer patients experience recurrent cisplatin-resistant cancer, for which treatment options are limited. We have previously shown that inhibition of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) or fatty acid oxidation (FAO) sensitizes cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin. However, it is unknown if HSP27 and FAO pathways interact to promote cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells. Therefore, we tested whether cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells are sensitive to concurrent HSP27 and FAO inhibition. Strikingly, dual inhibition of HSP27 and FAO, with the clinically employed drugs ivermectin and perhexiline respectively, dramatically decreased the viability of A2780CIS, a cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell line. We also found that HSP27 knockdown cancer cells are more sensitive to cisplatin and perhexiline dual treatment. Thus, we sought to test the hypothesis that cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells rely on FAO upon HSP27 inhibition to maintain cisplatin resistance. To test if FAO is affected by HSP27 inhibition, we measured AMPK activity and CPT1A expression, an inducer of FAO and the rate limiting enzyme of FAO respectively. We found that AMPK is activated and CPT1A is upregulated in HSP27 knockdown cancer cells. It has been shown that cisplatin induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) and that HSP27 is a negative regulator of ROS. Thus, we treated HSP27 knockdown cancer cells with cisplatin and measured the levels of mitochondrial and cellular ROS, oxidized\/reduced lipids, and reduced thiols using MitoSOX, CellROX, Image -iT Lipid Peroxidation, and ThiolTracker fluorescent dyes, respectively. Our data demonstrates that HSP27 inhibition increases mitochondrial ROS, cellular ROS, and the ratio of oxidized to reduced lipids in cisplatin-treated cells. Additionally, HSP27 inhibition decreases levels of reduced thiols in this context. Our preliminary data also suggests that cisplatin-treated HSP27 knockdown cells have decreased expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and glutathione reductase (GSR), key enzymes that facilitate the reduction of glutathione into its reduced form (GSH). Additionally, we demonstrate that attenuation of cisplatin-induced ROS with N-Acetyl cysteine (NAC) prevented cisplatin-induced apoptosis and ferroptosis. NAC also attenuated cisplatin-mediated induction of HSP27 and FAO gene expression in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells. Collectively, our results demonstrate that HSP27 and FAO are two parallel pathways that promote cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells by attenuating cisplatin-induced ROS. Future studies will determine the in vivo efficacy of this combination therapy and if dual inhibition leads to synergistic cell death through a ROS based mechanism.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Cisplatin resistance,Metabolism,Reactive oxygen species,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>James  P.

The triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype has among the worst prognosis due to high rates of recurrence and metastasis. Since TNBC lacks targetable receptor proteins, treatment relies upon non-specific chemotherapy, which can become ineffective upon onset of resistance. One potential driver of TNBC treatment resistance is MALT1, the effector component of the CARMA-BCL10-MALT1 signaling complex, which activates NF-&#954;B in multiple cancer cell types, including TNBC. Notably, breast cancer cells demonstrate increased sensitivity to chemotherapies such as doxorubicin and cisplatin when MALT1 is depleted. NF-&#954;B activation has been suggested to promote DNA repair and the MALT1-NF-&#954;B inducible factor, IL-6 has been shown to repress the immunogenic effects of doxorubicin. Hence, <u>we hypothesize that MALT1 is a pharmaceutically targetable driver of TNBC treatment resistance. Mechanistically, we hypothesize that MALT1 promotes chemotherapy resistance by enhancing DNA repair and suppressing immunogenic cell death.<\/u><br \/><b>Methods\/Results:<\/b> We analyzed RNAseq and proteomic data from TCGA and CPTAC, respectively, and found that MALT1 is highly expressed in basal breast cancer (a subtype largely composed of TNBC) and its expression level in this context is associated with reduced pathological complete response and survival. With the purpose of evaluating the effect of MALT1 protease inhibition on chemotherapy sensitivity, we first sought to identify TNBC cell lines that were most resistant to doxorubicin using GDSC and CTRP databases. Results indicated that MDA-MB-231, BT20 and HCC1143 were highly resistant. We then performed western blots to assess MALT1 expression and CellTiter-Glo assays to determine the doxorubicin IC50s for these cell lines. Results indicate that MALT1 expression correlates with the degree of doxorubicin resistance among these cell lines. To determine if MALT1 blockade, via siRNA-knockdown or MALT1 protease inhibitor treatment (JNJ-67856633 or MLT-748), increased doxorubicin sensitivity, CellTiter-Glo and Incucyte Caspase-3\/7 assays were performed. Findings indicated that MALT1 blockade results in decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis in response to doxorubicin. Mechanistically, MALT1 protease is activated by doxorubicin and MALT1 inhibition increases expression of the immunogenic cell death protein, calreticulin (CRT) in response to doxorubicin.<br \/><b>Conclusions and Future Directions:<\/b> Initial studies suggest that targeting MALT1 enhances TNBC sensitivity to doxorubicin. We will next assess the effect of MALT1 blockade on DNA repair mechanisms in doxorubicin-treated TNBC cells. Additionally, we will test the role of MALT1 in suppressing immunogenic cell death. Through these studies, we hope to inform new approaches for improving treatment response in TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Chemosensitization,MALT1,Doxorubicin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maria Beecher<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Dong Hu<sup>1<\/sup>, Linda Klei<sup>2<\/sup>, Jack Little<sup>1<\/sup>, Linda M.
