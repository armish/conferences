The expanding integration of omics profiling into cancer clinical trials opens a new opportunity to address this problem. Clinical trials ensure high quality of the treatment response information and clinical relevance of the identified molecular features and constructed prediction models. Here we present a python package ClinicalOmicsDB that provides a framework for systematic benchmarking of machine learning algorithms using a compendium of carefully collected and curated clinical omics datasets. The package further leverages interpretable AI to gain biological insights from high-performing models.<br \/>Approach: We downloaded omics datasets from 28 clinical trials across 7 cancer types, totaling 6127 patients and 60 treatment arms. For each treatment arm, we performed random stratified splitting of the data into 80% for training and the remaining 20% for testing, and this was repeated 30 times to create 30 simulated train-test pairs. Based on all 60 treatment arms, we created 1800 train-test pairs for prediction model development and evaluation. To illustrate the utility of this package, we benchmarked six supervised machine learning algorithms for their ability to distinguish responders from non-responders. For each training dataset, 5-fold cross-validation was used to select the top 20 non-redundant features and to optimize hyperparameters. The optimized pipeline was used to train a full model based on the complete training dataset, which was then applied to the paired testing dataset for performance evaluation using AUROC. Shapley plots were created for models with satisfactory AUROC scores to facilitate biological interpretation.<br \/>Results: Among the 6 algorithms tested, random forests had the best overall performance. It achieved an AUROC&#62;0.75 for 11 treatment arms. Shapley plot identified LPIN1 as a top predictive marker for the combination treatment of fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (AC) in unselected breast cancers. The cancer testis antigen MAGEA1 was among the top predictive markers for combination treatment with pembrolizumab, taxane, and AC in HER2- breast cancers. Shapley plot of a protein-based model identified SRC_Y527 and ERBB3 as the top biomarkers for predicting whether HER2+ breast cancer would respond to the combination of trastuzumab emtansine, pertuzumab, and AC.<br \/>Conclusion: We created a computational framework that uses real-world omics data to benchmark machine learning algorithms and to identify predictive markers based on best-performing models. More datasets will be continuously added, and new algorithms can be easily benchmarked against existing ones. ClinicalOmicsDB unifies the efforts from the clinical and machine learning communities to improve cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Machine learning,Databases,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chang In Moon<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Byron Jia<sup>2<\/sup>, Bing Zhang<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>Chemistry, Carleton College, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b09c7a4a-221d-4460-be6e-385408d20169","ControlNumber":"6627","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

Rational designs aim to identify synergistic drug interactions to produce superior treatments. However, metrics of drug interaction (i.e., synergy, additivity, antagonism) apply to pre-clinical experiments, and there has been no established method to quantify synergy versus additivity in clinical settings. Here, we propose and apply a model of drug additivity for progression-free survival (PFS) to assess if the clinical efficacies of approved drug combinations are more than, or equal to, the sum of their parts. This model accounts for the benefit from patient-to-patient variability in the best single drug response, plus the added benefit of the weaker drug per patient. Among all FDA approvals of combination therapies for advanced cancer between 1995 and 2020, we identified 37 combinations across 13 cancer types (24,723 patients) where the efficacies of monotherapies and combination therapies could be analyzed at matched doses. 95% of combination therapies exhibited progression-free survival times that were additive, or less than additive. Across all trials and follow-up times, the coefficient of determination of the additivity model was R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.90, with no fitting or training, only the operation of addition. While there were deviations from additivity, with several combinations being less than additive, 100% of the approved combinations studied would have been predicted to succeed by the additivity model. This study has two key findings. First, a synergistic effect (more than additive) is neither a necessary nor even common property of clinically effective drug combinations. Second, the predictable efficacy of many of the best drug combinations established over the past 25 years suggests that additivity can be used as a design principle for novel drug combinations and clinical trials, which could be helpful as the number of possible therapies grows and as cancers are increasingly divided into subtypes with distinct drug sensitivities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,Clinical trials,Systems biology,Drug synergy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Haeun Hwangbo<sup>1<\/sup>, Sarah Patterson<sup>1<\/sup>, Andy Dai<sup>2<\/sup>, Deborah Plana<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Adam C.

Here, we performed comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic analysis of 260 high-grade glioma cases, which revealed PDGFRA genomic alterations (mutations and\/or amplifications) in 13% of patients. H3K27M DMGs had significantly higher PDGFRA expression compared to H3 wild-type tumors, and PDGFRA gene amplification resulted in even higher expression levels in H3K27M DMGs as well as H3 wild-type HGGs. We tested a panel of patient- derived pHGG\/H3K27M DMG models against a range of PDGFRA inhibitors, including avapritinib, a potent small molecule inhibitor with relatively selective activity against both wild-type and mutant PDGFRA. Avapritinib showed supra-micromolar blood-brain barrier penetration in our pre-clinical models and demonstrated significant survival impact in an aggressive patient-derived H3K27M DMG mouse xenograft model. Finally, building on this preclinical activity, we report here the first clinical experience using avapritinib in eight pediatric and young adult patients with high-grade glioma (H3K27M DMG and\/or PDGFRA altered). Avapritinib has thus far been well tolerated with no significant acute toxicities. Most importantly, our preliminary data reveal radiographic response evaluated by RAPNO criteria in 50% of patients, a striking outcome rarely seen in this patient population. In summary, we report that avapritinib is a selective, CNS-penetrant small molecule inhibitor of PDGFRA that shows potent activity in preclinical models and produces promising clinical responses with good tolerability in patients with high-grade glioma. This suggests a promising role for avapritinib therapy in this population with previously dismal outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-02 Molecular targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioma,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Translation,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Lisa Mayr<sup>1<\/sup>, Maria Trissal<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Kallen Schwark<\/b><sup>3<\/sup>, Jenna Labelle<sup>2<\/sup>, Andrew Groves<sup>2<\/sup>, Julia Furtner-Srajer<sup>4<\/sup>, Jeffrey Supko<sup>5<\/sup>, Liesa Weiler-Wichtl<sup>1<\/sup>, Olivia Hack<sup>2<\/sup>, Jacob Rozowsky<sup>2<\/sup>, Joana  G.

The National Cancer Institute&#8217;s Patient-Derived Models Repository (<u>https:\/\/pdmr.cancer.gov<\/u><u><\/u>) offers a collection of highly characterized models from a variety of cancer types including rare and recalcitrant malignancies and tumors from patients of diverse ancestry. This collection includes matched sets of patient-derived cell lines, organoids, and xenografts (PDXs), which allows comparisons of drug responses from <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> assays performed with the same patient-derived tumor model. A high-throughput screen was conducted using matched sets of patient-derived organoids and cell lines. Patient-derived cell lines were grown as 3D multicellular spheroids mixed with endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells. The patient-derived organoids were 100% tumor cells and were plated in 5% basement membrane extract supplemented with growth factors and cytokines. All drugs were tested at concentrations up to their reported clinical C<sub>max<\/sub> values and cell viability for individual drug treatments and drug combinations were assayed using CellTiter-Glo 3D after seven days drug exposure. Prior to the endpoint viability measurements, growth curves for spheroid median volume and organoid median surface area were calculated from a series of non-invasive brightfield images collected every 12 hours. For some drug combinations, differential responses were observed between the matched organoids and multicellular spheroids, potentially reflecting the contribution of the stromal component in the spheroids. Overall, the drug-dependent growth responses observed from the two 3D <i>in vitro<\/i> models (i.e., multicellular spheroids and organoids) were frequently comparable to those observed <i>in vivo<\/i> from PDXs. For example, the <i>in vitro<\/i> activities of several drug combinations including: BAY1895344 + temozolomide, erlotinib + cediranib, entinostat + talazoparib, and selumetinib + abemaciclib, demonstrated good agreement with the responses observed <i>in vivo<\/i>. However, among the drug combinations tested ixazomib + panobinostat showed the greatest cytotoxicity <i>in vitro<\/i> but had no activity in the matched PDX models. The availability of matched patent-derived cell lines, organoids and PDXs provides an opportunity to learn about the features of assay methodologies and data analyses that influence the successful translation of preclinical results between <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> systems. The results of this study are encouraging, but also highlight discrepancies that will be important to investigate, understand and address in order to improve translational capacity of future assays.

Using natural language processing (NLP), we derived sites of metastasis, prior treatment at outside institutions, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) levels, and smoking status from records of patients with tumor sequencing to create a richly annotated clinicogenomic cohort. We sought to define whether combining features would improve models of overall survival (OS) and treatment response as validated in a multi-institution, manually curated cohort. We leveraged the manually curated AACR GENIE Biopharma Collaborative (BPC) dataset to train NLP algorithms to abstract the aforementioned features from overlapping records available at Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK). All models achieved precision and recall &#62; 0.85. We deployed these algorithms to records of all MSK patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and tumor profiling with our FDA-authorized institutional targeted sequencing platform (N=7,015). These labels were combined with genomic, demographic, histopathologic, internal treatment and staging data to train random survival forests (RSF) to predict OS and time-to-next-treatment (TTNT) for molecularly targeted and immunotherapies. RSFs trained on the MSK NSCLC cohort were validated with the curated, non-MSK BPC NSCLC cohort (N=977). The addition of NLP-derived variables to genomic features enhanced RSF predictive power for OS (c-index, 10x bootstrap 95%CI: 0.58, 0.57-0.59 vs 0.75, 0.74-0.76 combined) and targeted and immunotherapy TTNT. The size of the MSK NSCLC cohort enabled discovery of associations between metastatic sites, PD-L1 status, genomics, and TTNTs not apparent in the smaller BPC cohort. We measured the added predictive value of variables not available in BPC with MSK-only cross-validation analyses. White blood cell differential counts and additional tissue genomic features including tumor mutational burden and fraction genome altered added minimally, while circulating tumor DNA sequencing added prognostic power for OS over other factors including disease burden.&nbsp; Using NLP we present a large NSCLC cohort with rich clinicoradiographic annotation, leading to superior models of patient outcomes. Our data uncovers associations not observed in smaller, manually curated cohorts and provides a foundation for further research in therapy choice and prognostication.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AACR Project GENIE,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Machine learning,Cancer genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Justin Jee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chris Fong<sup>1<\/sup>, Karl Pichotta<sup>1<\/sup>, Thinh Tran<sup>1<\/sup>, Anisha Luthra<sup>1<\/sup>, Mirella Altoe<sup>1<\/sup>, Steven Maron<sup>1<\/sup>, Ronglai Shen<sup>1<\/sup>, Si-Yang Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Michele Waters<sup>1<\/sup>, Joseph Kholodenko<sup>1<\/sup>, Brooke Mastrogiacomo<sup>1<\/sup>, Susie Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, A Rose Brannon<sup>1<\/sup>, Michael  F.

However, due to the low number of detected mutations, mutational signatures were insufficiently explored for many tumors sequenced by targeted panels in clinics. It impedes the clinical application of mutational signatures. Here, we present a new method, SALMON (Signature Analyzer for Low Mutation cOuNts), to identify mutational signatures in targeted sequenced tumors based on tumor mutational burden. SALMON adjusts for panel size differences and uses a large number of targeted sequenced tumors rather than a large number of mutations per tumor (as with whole exome or genome sequencing) to overcome the challenges of mutational signature analysis for targeted sequencing. Extensive simulations and pseudo-targeted sequenced data show that SALMON can accurately detect spiky or common signatures. We applied SALMON to investigate the pan-cancer patterns of mutational signatures for 100,477 targeted sequenced tumors in AACR Project GENIE, including 14,428 lung and 11,389 breast tumors. We detected well-established signatures in tumor types that have not previously been associated with these signatures, such as the smoking signature in ovarian tumors. Interestingly, analysis of thousands of tumors per cancer type from diverse populations revealed gender discrepancies, self-described race differences, subtype heterogeneity, and metastatic enrichment of mutational signatures. For instance, most sex-biased signatures are more frequently present in males for non-gender-specific cancers. Thiopurine treatment-induced signature in glioma is enriched in Black patients. And endometrioid ovarian or uterine cancers have a higher prevalence of polymerase epsilon (POLE) deficiency-related signatures than non-endometrioid ovarian or uterine cancers, respectively. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and utility of mutational signature analysis for targeted sequenced tumors, enabling precision applications of mutational signatures in the clinical setting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AACR Project GENIE,Mutational signatures,Targeted panel sequencing,Tumor heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Donghyuk Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Min Hua<sup>2<\/sup>, Difei Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Lei Song<sup>2<\/sup>, Tongwu Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Kai Yu<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiaohong  R.

However, effective targeted therapies are scarce as we have a limited understanding of how drug responses are modulated by tumor genotype. Here, we utilize both human data and in vivo models to identify genetic drivers of therapy response in KRAS-driven non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. We first present an integrative causal inference analysis of three clinical data resources: (1) the recently released Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange, Biopharma Collaboration dataset (GENIE-BPC; n=197), (2) a selected set of patients from the Tempus Clinico-genomic Database (n=330), and (3) an additional cohort from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (n=218). Each dataset was first analyzed separately using a causal inference pipeline. Doubly robust estimators for each variant were inferred within a counting process survival analysis model accounting for time-varying treatments and immortal time bias. Meta-analysis of the results from all three cohorts identified three commonly mutated and highly replicable genes with a significant effect on overall survival: KEAP1, SMARCA4, and CDKN2A.<br \/>As further validation, we used our murine in vivo pharmacogenomics (PGx) platform that can quantify the effects of therapies across thousands of tumors of diverse genotypes. These tumors are initiated de novo in the native microenvironmental context in mice with an intact adaptive immune system. We tested a chemotherapy combination of carboplatin and pemetrexed in mice with KrasG12D-driven lung tumors and inactivation of each of 60 putative tumor suppressors. Treatment led to &#62;75% reduction in tumor sizes relative to tumor suppressor inactivated (matched) vehicle-treated controls. These models identified causal effects for two out of the three candidates above: KEAP1 (resistance) and CDKN2A (sensitive). Moreover, our PGx platform identified additional candidate genes beyond those found using the clinical data, which had insufficient sample size for these rarely mutated genes. Together, we demonstrate how leveraging our PGx platform together with human data within a causal inference framework may improve the stratification of patients by their clinical outcomes, profoundly advancing the promise of precision medicine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AACR Project GENIE,Biomarkers,NSCLC,Translation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"David Amar<sup>1<\/sup>, Erick Scott<sup>1<\/sup>, Ian P.
