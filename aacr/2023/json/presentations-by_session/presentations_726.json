[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> PARP inhibitors (PARPi) are superior to chemotherapy in pts with <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i>m MBC, with median PFS (mPFS) of 7 months with single-agent ola. Sapa is an oral nucleoside analog; the active metabolite, CNDAC, generates single-strand DNA breaks that are converted to double-strand breaks (DSB) during subsequent replication, resulting in cell death. CNDAC-induced DSB repair is dependent on homologous recombination. Sapa combined with ola may augment DNA damage compared to ola alone in <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i>m tumors.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We conducted a phase Ib study of sapa\/ola in pts with <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i>m HER2-negative MBC who were not previously PARPi-exposed. Primary objective was to determine the RP2D of sapa with ola. Secondary objectives included safety, tolerability and mPFS. RAD51 staining was performed on archival tissue. Serial blood samples were collected for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis using low-pass WGS with targeted sequencing via the DDR Discovery Panel (Resolution Bioscience).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>10 women (median age 46) were enrolled before the study was terminated for hematologic toxicity. Germline <i>BRCA1<\/i> and <i>BRCA2<\/i> mutations were present in 3 and 7 pts, respectively. 4 pts had received prior platinum. All pts initially received standard dose ola (300 mg twice daily) with 100 mg (n = 3), 150 mg (n = 4), or 200 mg (n = 3) sapa once daily on days 1-5 and 8-12 of an every 28-day cycle. The RP2D was not determined. Hematologic AEs were common, including anemia (80%), neutropenia (80%), and thrombocytopenia (40%), with 1 DLT of G4 neutropenia lasting more than 7 days. The ORR was 50% (95% CI: 18.7% - 81.3%) with mPFS of 9.7 months (95% CI: 8.02 - NA). 3 pts had clinical benefit of 15+ months, exceeding expectations with olaparib alone, including 2 with PR, and 2 who remained on trial for 36+ months. 3 patients had confirmed PRs of short duration. Of the remaining patients, one withdrew consent early and the other 3 had non-CR\/non-PD or SD of 4, 7 and 9 months. At progression, 2 pts had evidence of BRCA reversion mutation associated with an MMEJ signature; ctDNA also demonstrated <i>MRE11<\/i> and <i>PTEN <\/i>amplifications in 1 of these pts, suggesting multiple resistance mechanisms. 3 pts had no evidence of reversion but had acquired putative non-reversion mechanisms of resistance, including changes suggesting enhanced MRN complex function, <i>FANCD2<\/i> and <i>ATR<\/i> amplifications and <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutation. The majority of tumors (6\/10) were RAD51-negative. Other tumors with RAD51 foci demonstrated replication stress evidenced by high levels of pKAP1 and pRPA, suggesting benefit associated with sapa.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Sapa\/ola produces high rates of hematologic toxicity. However, the ORR of 50%, mPFS of 9.7 months, and durability of 3+ years in 2 pts suggest possible combinatorial benefit. Further exploration with different sapa schedules or with substitution of a PARP1-selective inhibitor to decrease hematologic toxicity is warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP inhibitors,Nucleoside analogs,BRCA,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Filipa Lynce<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noah Graham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bose S.

Previous studies have shown that de-fucosylated antibody binds to Fc&#947;RIIIa with increased affinity and can thus trigger Fc&#947;RIIIa-mediated effector functions more efficiently than native antibody. BAT1006 was expressed in an FUT8-knockout CHO cell line, resulting in antibody completely devoid of fucose modification. With approximate 5-fold higher level of ADCC effect compared to Pertuzumab, BAT1006 also exhibited potent anti-tumor activity in HER2 positive Calu-3 xenograft mice model. The ongoing phase I, open-label, first-in-human study is evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity and preliminary efficacy of BAT1006 to determine the Maximum-Tolerated Dose (MTD) and\/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D).<br \/>Methods: Patients with locally advanced\/metastatic solid tumors received escalating doses of BAT1006 (3, 6, 10, 15 mg\/kg), administered intravenously (IV) once every three weeks. Patients must have had documented HER2 positivity defined as 3+ by validated immunohistochemistry or amplified on in situ hybridization (ISH). Assessments include archival tumor molecular status, PK, and efficacy by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).<br \/>Results: Fifteen patients [with 2-9 prior lines of therapy] have been treated with BAT1006. All patients had metastatic breast cancer and had received previous HER2-targeted therapies including Trastuzumab, Pertuzumab, T-DM1 and Pyrotinib. No treatment related &#8805; Grade 3 AEs have been observed. Of 9 patients at 10mg\/kg and 15mg\/kg, 1 in 3 patients had CR at 10mg\/kg, 2 in 6 patients had PR at 15mg\/kg.<br \/>Conclusion: BAT1006 was well tolerated and showed promising anti-tumor activity in patients with heavily pre-treated HER2-positive cancers. Based on the safety and efficacy results, one additional dose level (20 mg\/kg) will be added to the escalation phase and combination therapy with other HER2-based therapy will also be initiated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HER2,ADCC,Antibody,Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xingxing Mei<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weijia Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuqiang Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hao Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chuanqi Cao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cuiying Feng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Bert E.

TG6002 is an engineered Copenhagen strain oncolytic Vaccinia virus, deleted of thymidine kinase and ribonucleotide reductase to enhance tumor selective viral replication and expressing FCU1, an enzyme converting the non-cytotoxic prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) into the chemotherapeutic compound 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). In this trial, patients with advanced unresectable liver-dominant metastatic colorectal cancer who had failed previous oxaliplatin and irinotecan-based chemotherapy were treated with up to 2 cycles of TG6002 infusion 6 weeks apart via the hepatic artery on day 1 combined with oral 5-FC on days 5 to 14 (where day 1 = TG6002 infusion). TG6002 infusion was performed over 30 minutes via selective catheterization of the hepatic artery proper. 5-FC oral dosing was 50mg\/kg x4 daily. Blood was sampled for TG6002 pharmacokinetics and 5-FC and 5-FU measurements. Sampling of liver metastases was performed at screening and on day 4 or day 8 for virus detection and 5-FC and 5-FU quantification. In total, 15 patients (median age 61 years, range 37-78) were treated in 1 UK centre and 2 centres in France and received a dose of TG6002 of 1x10<sup>6<\/sup> (n=3), 1x10<sup>7<\/sup> (n=3), 1x10<sup>8<\/sup> (n=3), or 1x10<sup>9<\/sup> pfu (n=6). Fourteen of the 15 patients received a single cycle of treatment, including one patient who did not received 5-FC, and one patient received two cycles. TG6002 was transiently detected in plasma following administration, suggesting a strong tissue selectivity for viral replication. In the highest dose cohort, a virus rebound was observed on day 8, concordant with replication time of the virus. In serum samples, 5-FU was present on day 8 in all patients with a high variability ranging from 0.8 to 1072 ng\/mL and was measurable over several days after initiation of therapy. Seven of the 9 patients evaluable showed the biodistribution of the virus in liver lesions by PCR testing on day 4 or day 8. Translational blood samples showed evidence for T-cell activation and immune checkpoint receptor-ligand expression. At 1x10<sup>9<\/sup> pfu, there was evidence for T-cell proliferation and activation against tumour-associated antigens by ELISpot and for immunogenic cell death. In terms of safety, a total of 34 TG6002-related adverse events were reported, of which 32 were grade 1-2 and 2 were grade 3. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached, and a single dose-limiting toxicity was observed consisting of a myocardial infarction in a context of recent Covid-19 infection in a 78-year-old patient. These results indicate that TG6002 infused via the hepatic artery in combination with oral 5-FC was well tolerated, effectively localized and replicated in the tumor tissues, expressed its therapeutic payload and showed anti-tumoral immunological activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Liver,Vaccinia virus,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Adel Samson<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cristina Smolenschi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philippe Cassier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jai V.

As the primary elimination pathway for futibatinib is hepatic metabolism, we conducted a phase 1 study to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment (HI) on futibatinib pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety in healthy adults.<br \/>Methods: A single oral dose of 20 mg futibatinib was administered to adult subjects with mild (Child-Pugh score, 5-6), moderate (7-9), or severe (10-15) HI. Control healthy subjects were matched to each HI cohort according to age, body mass index, and sex. Intensive PK samples were collected up to 72 hours post-dose. Exposure measures (AUC<sub>0-inf<\/sub>, AUC<sub>0-t<\/sub>, and C<sub>max<\/sub>) in subjects with HI were compared with matching control cohorts and with the overall healthy-control cohort. Relationships between plasma PK and HI were examined graphically via scatter\/regression plots of PK parameters versus baseline Child-Pugh score, bilirubin, albumin, international normalized ratio, and aspartate aminotransferase.<br \/>Results: Overall, 38 subjects were enrolled (mild HI, n = 8; moderate HI, n = 8; severe HI, n = 6; healthy controls, n = 16). Following the administration of futibatinib, no trend was observed between the severity of HI and the extent of futibatinib exposure increase. Compared with matched controls, AUC<sub>0-inf<\/sub> increased by 21%, 20% and 18%, and C<sub>max<\/sub> by 43%, 15%, and 10% in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe HI, respectively. Changes in exposure were not considered clinically relevant as geometric mean ratios were within 80-125% bioequivalence limits, except for C<sub>max<\/sub> in subjects with mild HI (43%). Futibatinib PK parameters and HI measures did not appear to be associated based on visual inspection or statistical evaluation of regression plots (p-values all &#62; 0.05). No subjects discontinued from the study due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Overall, two (12.5%) subjects in the healthy-control cohort reported one Grade 1 TEAE each (dyspepsia and headache) and two (25.0 %) subjects in the mild HI cohort each reported one Grade 1 TEAE (toothache and headache). All TEAEs were considered related to treatment. No subjects with moderate\/severe HI reported TEAEs.<br \/>Conclusions: No clinically meaningful differences in the systemic plasma exposure of futibatinib were observed based on the severity of HI.

In addition to the specific killing of cancer cells via oncolytic adenovirus, these agents prompt the immune system to stimulate an antitumor immune response. OBP-301 is an oncolytic adenovirus in which gene is modified to be able to selectively replicate in cancer cells by introducing hTERT promotor. Further antitumor effect might be expected with an active activation of two different antitumor immunity by OBP-301 in combination with pembrolizumab. Therefore, we conducted phase I study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of OBP-301 with pembrolizumab.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: The major eligibility criteria are pts with advanced or metastatic solid tumor not responded to or intolerant of standard chemotherapies, and with possibility of intratumoral injection. Phase Ia part was designed to determine the recommended dose in a &#8220;3+3&#8221; cohort-based dose escalation design of OBP-301 (1x10<sup>10<\/sup>VP on cohort 1, 1x10<sup>11<\/sup>VP on cohort 2 and 1x10<sup>12<\/sup>VP on cohort 3) with pembrolizumab (200mg\/body q3w). OBP-301 is administered at day1, 15, and 29 by intratumoral injection and pembrolizumab is administered at day 8 and thereafter every 3 weeks. Primary endpoint is DLT. Secondary endpoints are response rate, progression free survival, and incidence of adverse event. Phase Ib part was designated to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the recommended dose OBP-301 selected in phase Ia part in combination with pembrolizumab. Biomarker study was planned to use paired samples of both tumor biopsy and blood. Clinical trial information: NCT03172819.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> A total 22 pts (phase Ia part: 11 pts, phase Ib part: 11 pts) were enrolled in the study from Dec 2017 to Feb 2021. Median age was 65. Among the pts, 18 had esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 2 had gastric cancer, one EGJ cancer, and one had colon cancer. No DLT was observed and the recommended dose for phase Ib part was 1x10<sup>12<\/sup>VP (cohort 3). Eighteen pts was injected to primary site, and 5 pts injected to metastatic site (Lymph node:1, Liver:3). Common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were fever (4.5%), and abnormal hepatic function (4.5%). Objective tumour responses were documented in 2(9.1%) of 22 pts. Tumor samples were subjected to multiplex immunohistochemistry (17 pts) and showed that tumor-infiltrating PD-1+CD8+ T cells prior to the treatment were significantly higher in 5 responders who experienced PR or &#62;6 months SD, compared with 12 non-responders (P=0.0365).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The combination of OBP-301 with pembrolizumab was well tolerated and showed limited response. The result of biomarker analyses using paired samples of both tumor biopsy and blood will be presented. Tumor-infiltrating PD-1+CD8+ T cells could be a biomarker for this combinatory therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic adenovirus,Immune checkpoint blockade,Gastrointestinal cancers: other,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Takashi Kojima<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Toshiyoshi Fujiwara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shunsuke Tanabe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomoyuki Kadota<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiromi Ono<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kazuko Tsukamoto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takashi Ikeno<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masashi Wakabayashi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Akihiro Sato<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Masanori Kondo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shogo Kumagai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shohei Koyama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hiroyoshi Nishikawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Toshihiko Doi<\/i><\/presenter>.

ETCTN 10388 (NCT04234568) evaluated safety and efficacy of the combination of lutetium 177 DOTATATE, a beta-emitting radionuclide in combination with triapine, a ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) inhibitor.<br \/>Method: This study was a multicenter phase 1 dose escalation trial [using the Bayesian optimal interval design (BOIN)] of triapine in combination with fixed dose lutetium Lu 177 DOTATATE for well-differentiated somatostatin receptor-positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (GEP-NETs) after the failure of at least one line of prior systemic cancer treatment with an expansion cohort at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Oral triapine (100mg, 150mg, 200mg) was administered once daily on days 1-14 and Lu-177 DOTATATE [200 mCi] intravenously on day 1 of every 56-day cycle. A total of 4 cycles were administered. Response and adverse effects were assessed per RECIST and CTCAE 5.0, respectively. Exploratory correlative studies included tumor somatic and germline mutation testing, RNA sequencing, pharmacokinetics, deoxynucleosides and circulating cell free DNA analysis. Primary endpoints were safety and RP2D.<br \/>Results: Overall, 31 patients were enrolled between 6 sites, 15 in the dose escalation phase and 16 in the dose expansion phase. Adverse events (AE) were assessed in all 31 patients per CTCAE 5.0. One DLT in dose level 1, seven DLTs in dose level 2, and one grade 5 DLT in dose level 3 were observed. The RP2D of the combination is triapine 150 mg QD (dose level 2) on days 1-14 in combination with Lu-177 DOTATATE on day 1 of every 56-day cycle. Detailed safety and adverse event data will be presented at the meeting. There were 28 patients evaluable for efficacy, of which 6 (21%) achieved a partial response. At 12 months, 6 patients had progressed, while 22 (86%) remained progression free. Median PFS has not been reached. PK data were available for 12 patients enrolled in the dose escalation cohort.

We aim to enhance the anti-tumor and pro-immunogenic effect of standard-of-care nab-paclitaxel\/gemcitabine (GnP) by concomitant epigenetic targeting followed by immune-modulating maintenance therapy in patients (pts) with treatment-naive metastatic PDAC. This phase 1\/2, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation\/dose-expansion study evaluates the safety and tolerability of azacitidine (AZA) and romidepsin (ROM) in combination with GnP and the potential of immune-modulating consolidation with durvalumab and lenalidomide after three cycles of either GnP or GnP plus epigenetic targeting. Here we report interim results of the dose escalation.<br \/><u>Methods:<\/u> In part 1A, dose escalation of three regimen ROM\/GnP (arm A), AZA\/GnP (arm B) and ROM\/AZA\/GnP (arm C) for determination of the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) is performed with a 3 + 3 dose escalation scheme using fixed dose levels. For dose expansion (part 1B), one of the treatment arms (Arm C over B over A) is continued using a Simon two-stage design to a maximum of 35 patients. The efficacy of the sequential programmed death-ligand (PD-L)1 blockade in combination with low-dose lenalidomide is evaluated in study part 2 (consolidation part) for pts with controlled disease (DCR) after 3 cycles of part 1 therapy. Evaluation of the consolidation concept in part 2 requires a sufficient DCR based on the statistical considerations. Thus, in addition to pts in part 1A and 1B, pts treated with GnP alone are additionally recruited (standard arm), so that at least 41 pts with controlled disease after 3 cycles of therapy are available for part 2. Key eligibility includes metastatic PDAC (stage IV), ECOG 0-1 and no prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy therapy for stage IV PDAC. Primary objectives include safety and tolerability of AZA and\/or ROM in combination with GnP followed by sequential immune targeting with PD-L1 blockade in combination with low-dose lenalidomide.<br \/><u>Results:<\/u> In October 2022, 76 pts were enrolled, of which 67 pts were treated with at least one dose of study medication. The median age in the treated population was 62.8 years (range: 33 - 83), 32 (47.8 %) were female, 80.6 %\/13.4 % were included with ECOG 0\/1. In part 1A, an RDE of 2mg\/m&#178; for ROM (N=3, dose level L-1) and 30mg\/m&#178; for AZA (N=6, dose level L1) was established, respectively. The combined administration of AZA (30 mg\/m&#178;), ROM (2 mg\/m&#178;) and GnP (arm C) led to severe DLTs, namely neutropenia, non-hematologic toxicities (&#62; grade2) and ROM related non-hematologic toxicities (&#8805; grade2) in all three patients. Given the best safety profile, Arm B was chosen for the expansion part 1B.<br \/><u>Conclusions:<\/u> ROM in combination with GnP showed considerable toxicity at dose level L1 as did the combination of ROM (dose level L-1) and AZA (dose level L1) with GnP.

Oncolytic adenovirus-mediated cytotoxic gene therapy is an investigational cancer therapy. Delivery of the suicide gene to the tumor is by direct intratumoral or systemic injection of a viral vector containing the suicide gene. Our approach incorporates yeast cytosine deaminase (yCD) and herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-1 TK), to confer sensitivity to 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) and Valganciclovir (vGCV), respectively. The pro-drugs are converted into active drugs that inhibit DNA damage repair. Here we report the safety of oncolytic adenovirus-mediated suicide gene therapy that incorporates an interleukin-12 (IL12) gene for treatment of recurrent prostate cancer.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In this phase I study, a replication-competent adenovirus (Ad5-yCD\/<i>mut<\/i>TK<sub>SR39<\/sub>rep-hIL-12) expressing yCD\/mutTK<sub>SR39<\/sub> (yeast cytidine deaminase\/mutant S39R HSV-1 thymidine kinase) and human IL-12 (IL12) was injected into tumors of 15 subjects with recurrent prostate cancer (T1c-T2) at escalating doses (1 &#215; 10<sup>10<\/sup>, 3 &#215; 10<sup>10<\/sup>, 1 &#215; 10<sup>11<\/sup>, 3 &#215; 10<sup>11<\/sup>, or 1 &#215; 10<sup>12<\/sup> viral particles). Subjects received 5-FC and vGCV for 7 days. The study endpoint was toxicity through day 30. Experimental endpoints included measurements of serum IL12, interferon gamma (IFN&#947;), and CXCL10 to assess immune system activation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and proliferation markers were analyzed by flow cytometry.<br \/><b>Results and Conclusions:<\/b> Fifteen patients received Ad5-yCD\/<i>mut<\/i>TK<sub>SR39<\/sub>rep-hIL-12 and oral 5-FC and vGCV. Approximately 92% of the 115 adverse events observed were grade 1\/2 requiring no medical intervention. Ad5-yCD\/<i>mut<\/i>TK<sub>SR39<\/sub>rep-hIL-12 DNA was detected in the blood of only two patients. Elevated serum IL12, IFN&#947;, and CXCL10 levels were detected in 57%, 93%, and 79% of subjects, respectively. Serum cytokines demonstrated viral dose dependency, especially apparent in the highest-dose cohorts. Analysis of immune cell populations indicated activation after Ad5-yCD\/<i>mut<\/i>TK<sub>SR39<\/sub>rep-hIL-12 administration in cohort 5. The study did not detect a significant difference in the PSA doubling time (PSADT) between pre and post treatment by paired Wilcoxon rank test (p=0.17). There was no correlation between adenoviral dose and PSADT in each cohort separately or pooled (cohorts1-3 and cohorts 4-5). The study maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached indicating 10<sup>12<\/sup> viral particles was safe. This trial confirmed that replication-competent Ad5-IL-12 adenovirus (Ad5-yCD\/<i>mut<\/i>TK<sub>SR39<\/sub><i>rep<\/i>-hIL-12) was well tolerated when administered locally to prostate tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adenovirus vector,Interleukin-12,Prostate cancer,Gene therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shyam Nyati<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hans Stricker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kenneth L.

As part of the phase 1 dose-escalation clinical trial (NCT03907852), patients with advanced solid tumors expressing mesothelin were administered a single infusion of gavo-cel. Thirty-two patients with late-stage disease (23 MPM, 8 ovarian and 1 cholangiocarcinoma) received gavo-cel at doses ranging from 5x10<sup>7<\/sup> - 5x10<sup>8<\/sup> TRuC cells\/m<sup>2<\/sup>. The disease control rate (defined as achieving a response by RECISTv1.1 criteria or having stable disease [SD] for at least 12 weeks post-infusion) was 77%. Dose level 3 (1x10<sup>8<\/sup> TRuC cells\/m<sup>2<\/sup><sup> <\/sup>following lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine) was selected as the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for the ongoing phase 2 portion of the trial. Spatial distribution of immune cells, particularly T cells, in the tumor and stromal regions of tumor biopsies has been shown to identify patients that may respond to immunotherapies. To understand the tumor immune contexture, we profiled the T cell compartment in biopsies from five patients collected prior to and eight weeks post treatment using multiplexed immunofluorescence. We observed that the MPM patient with a partial response (PR) had a greater number of T cells at baseline in tumor biopsies when compared with the other SD patients. Notably, this patient with a PR, had a 3.6-fold increase in CD3+CD8+ T cell infiltrates into the tumor bed. In contrast, 2 SD patients with MPM had a minimal increase of T cells in the tumor compartment at 8 weeks post infusion. The density of TILs 8 weeks post infusion was much lower in the SD patients compared to the PR subject, indicating a potentially insufficient number of infiltrating T cells. Interestingly, 2\/2 SD patients with ovarian cancer had a decrease in CD3+CD8+ T cells infiltrating into the tumor, consistent with an immune exclusion phenotype. The PR patient with MPM had minimal increase in PD-L1 and CD155 (a ligand for the inhibitory receptor, TIGIT) from negligible levels at baseline, whereas both SD patients with MPM had marked increases in PD-L1 and CD155, indicating potential resistance mechanisms. In summary, this preliminary data suggests although CD8+ TILs are increased following treatment with gavo-cel, the tumor regions in patients with SD show evidence of immune surveillance escape via PD-L1 and CD155 upregulation, thus acting as putative mechanisms of resistance. However, as seen in the PR patient with MPM there appears to be a critical number of TILs associating with response. We are currently evaluating the tumor immune contexture in phase 2, focusing on differences across tumor types with regards to TIL content, T cell influx, and correlations with response. We will also explore additional markers such as PD-1 and TIGIT, to profile the exhaustion state of immune cells and their spatial relationship with infiltrating gavo-cel T cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mesothelin,Adoptive cell therapy,Phase I,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Munisha Smalley<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Ross<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samantha F.

Immune checkpoint blockade with PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors has revolutionized treatment in the recurrent setting, but resistance to these therapies frequently occurs. Combination of checkpoint inhibitors with the ATR inhibitor ceralasertib could provide an exciting opportunity, with encouraging clinical activity reported in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (Kwon <i>et al.<\/i> 2022; Kim <i>et al.<\/i> 2022; Besse <i>et al.<\/i> OA15.05 IASLC 2022 WCLC). This phase 1b trial provided a unique opportunity to understand the immunomodulatory impact of DNA Damage Response (DDR) inhibitors in a clinical setting.<br \/>NCT03022409 is an open-label, randomized window of opportunity trial where patients with HNSCC were treated with either the PARP inhibitor olaparib (300mg BID) or ceralasertib (160mg BID) for 9-21 days, prior to definitive surgery (or on-treatment biopsy). 21 patients were randomized; n=12 to ceralasertib and n=9 to olaparib, and ceralasertib data will be presented here. Translational endpoints on frozen and fixed tumor biopsies included spatial pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic biomarkers, multiplexed fluorescence of tumor infiltrating immune cells and gene expression panels. Blood assessments included cytokine detection, immune cell phenotyping and gene expression. Primary endpoint analysis utilized a bespoke prognostic immune-focused gene signature and secondary endpoint an IHC immunoscore, both aimed to measure if tumors would shift from a &#8216;cold&#8217; to &#8216;hot\/active&#8217; immune state.We observed an &#8216;on-drug&#8217; selective suppression of proliferating Ki67+ T-cells (but not total T-cells) in the tumor microenvironment and periphery, followed by a repopulation and median rebound of 63.8% and 187.5% above baseline levels for peripheral helper (CD4+Ki67+; n=8) and cytotoxic (CD8+Ki67+; n=7) T-cells respectively, when ceralasertib dose stopped. IL-12 plasma cytokine levels dropped on ceralasertib treatment and returned to baseline levels &#8216;off-drug&#8217; in 8\/10 patients. Type-I interferon (IFN1) gene expression associated signatures were also upregulated in PBMCs, suggestive of an immune priming effect. 0\/2 and 2\/4 patients on ceralasertib met their primary and secondary endpoints respectively, however, interpretation is limited due to small numbers of evaluable patients. 1 patient had a grade 3 serious adverse event of chest pain in the ceralasertib arm. There were no unexpected safety findings for either drug and adverse events were generally low grade.The translational data has generated new insights into the immunomodulatory effect of ceralasertib. Further evaluation of the combination of ceralasertib with immune checkpoint blockade is warranted to explore this novel immune mechanism of action.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,Immunomodulation,Biomarkers,ATR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gemma N.

Through scRNAseq and CITEseq on human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>p53<sup>-\/-<\/sup> lung cancer model we previously described a tumor-enriched dendritic cell program of concomitant immunosuppression and activation which we termed the &#8220;mregDC,&#8221; that was also notable for a strong Th2 immune signature. We subsequently blocked the canonical Th2 cytokine IL-4 <i>in vivo<\/i> in tumor-bearing mice, and found that this significantly decreased lung tumor burden, which was recapitulated in multiple other tumor models. Furthermore, this effect synergized with PD-L1 blockade. Based on this data, we designed a clinical trial to assess if the addition of dupilumab, an anti-IL-4Ra antibody widely used for treatment of atopic diseases, may rescue responses to checkpoint blockade (NCT05013450).<br \/>In this Phase 1b\/2 trial, up to 21 patients with NSCLC that have progressed on prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy will be enrolled. Patients continue PD-(L)1 blockade while receiving three doses of dupilumab, administered every three weeks, with initial radiographic assessment of response at 9 weeks. Patients without progression of disease then continue anti-PD-(L)1 alone. The primary endpoint of Phase 1b is safety and tolerability, while the primary endpoint of Phase 2, inclusive of patients from Phase 1b, is efficacy as per RECIST. Patients undergo pre- and on-treatment biopsies, pre-treatment stool collection for microbiome analysis, as well as blood collection at 6 timepoints for PBMCs, plasma and ctDNA. Here we report the Phase 1b portion that has completed accrual in which 6 patients were enrolled in a Phase 1b run-in to confirm safety and tolerability.<br \/>There were no adverse events attributable to study treatment during Phase 1b in any of the 6 patients treated. Serum proteomic analysis of this cohort revealed that dupilumab treatment induced a profound increase in proinflammatory\/tumoricidal immune effector molecules, and reversed a systemic Th2 cytokine signature. Furthermore, mass cytometry of circulating immune populations showed an expansion of cytotoxic lymphocyte populations and a reduction in immunosuppressive myeloid cells. The fourth patient treated on trial who had progressive disease after 9 cycles of consolidation checkpoint blockade following concurrent chemoradiation for squamous NSCLC was enrolled, and had a partial response at 9 weeks, with deepening of the PR at 25 weeks. This patient&#8217;s on-treatment biopsy showed a major increase in CD8 T cell tumor infiltration. Histological analysis using spatial transcriptomics and multiplexed imaging from these patients is ongoing, and will be reported at the conference.<br \/>Based on this promising signal in the initial lead-in, the trial will proceed through Simon&#8217;s Two Stage design and enroll a full 21 patients as part of the Phase 2 expansion cohort. This clinical trial is funded entirely through philanthropy support through the Tisch Cancer Institute.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Cytokines,Immunosuppression,NSCLC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Thomas Urban Marron<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nelson M.

And it still had an unmet clinical need in this therapy area.HS-10365 is a highly potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and the preclinical studies have indicated its favorable safety and antitumor activity in RET-altered tumor models. Here, we conducted a phase I study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and anti-tumor activity of HS-10365 in RET-altered solid tumors.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>This study (NCT05207787) recruited patients (pts) with RET-altered advanced solid tumors, including RET fusion-positive (+) NSCLC, RET-mutated medullary thyroid carcinoma and so on.

We report results from a phase 1b dose-expansion cohort of xevinapant, a first-in-class, oral, small-molecule IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis protein) inhibitor that restores cancer cell sensitivity to apoptosis, and avelumab (anti-PD-L1) in pts with advanced NSCLC.<br \/><b>METHODS: <\/b>The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D; 28-day cycles of xevinapant 200 mg\/day [days 1-10 and 15-24] + avelumab 10 mg\/kg [days 1 and 15]) was previously established during the dose-escalation part of this phase 1, open-label study. In this dose-expansion cohort, pts with advanced NSCLC who progressed on first-line (1L) platinum-based chemotherapy (CTx) or anti-PD-1\/L1 &#177; platinum-based CTx received xevinapant (at RP2D) + avelumab for 13 cycles. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints included duration of response (DoR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK).<br \/><b>RESULTS:<\/b> 38 pts were treated: most had squamous cell carcinoma (45%) or adenocarcinoma (42%) of the lung, 11% had prior anti-PD-L1 therapy, 71% were men, and median age was 62 years (range, 35-75). 1 pt completed 13 cycles, and 37 permanently discontinued treatment; most common reasons were progressive disease (PD; 70%) and adverse events (AEs; 27%). ORR was 10.5% (95% CI 2.9-24.8). Best overall response (BOR): 4 pts had a confirmed partial response (PR), 19 had stable disease, and 15 had PD. Median DoR in responders was 15.9 months (95% CI 3.5-29.7); DCR was 60.5% (95% CI 43.4-76.0). Median PFS was 3.5 months (95% CI 1.9-5.1); median OS was 9.4 months (95% CI 6.7-16.2). Most pts (n=37; 97.4%) had treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs); 21 (55.3%) had grade &#8805;3. Most common TEAEs were decreased appetite (n=13; 34.2%) and ALT increase (n=11; 28.9%). Nine pts died due to TEAEs; none were considered treatment-related. Xevinapant and avelumab PK were comparable to monotherapy at the same doses. In exploratory biomarker analyses, plasma IL-10 levels increased during the study treatment period. In blood, activated CD4 T cells and Tregs increased during cycle 1, and activated CD8 T cells increased during the treatment period; however, these did not correlate with antitumor activity. In tumor samples, low Ki67 expression was associated with BOR of PR (n=4), and increases in macrophages, Tregs, Th1 cells, and dendritic cells were associated with disease control.<br \/><b>CONCLUSION:<\/b> Xevinapant + avelumab had tolerable safety in pts with advanced NSCLC who progressed on 1L platinum-based CTx or anti-PD-1\/L1 &#177; platinum-based CTx; however, the study did not meet its primary endpoint as antitumor activity was comparable to historic data for avelumab second-line monotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"IAP,Anti-PD-1,Immune checkpoint,NSCLC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Quincy Chu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tudor Ciuleanu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rodryg Ramlau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Renouf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rosalyn Juergens<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ewa Kalinka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Piotr Sawrycki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonathan Bramson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brad Nelson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rafael Crabbé<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniela A.

BI 1810631 is a HER2-selective TKI that covalently binds to both wild-type and mutated HER2 receptors, including exon 20 insertions, whilst sparing EGFR signaling. This ongoing Phase Ia\/Ib, open-label, non-randomized study aims to determine the safety, MTD, PK, pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of BI 1810631 in pts with HER2 aberration-positive solid tumors (NCT04886804). Here, we present interim results of Phase Ia.<br \/>Materials and Methods: In Phase Ia, pts with HER2 aberration-positive (overexpression, gene amplification, somatic mutation, or gene rearrangements) advanced\/unresectable\/metastatic solid tumors refractory\/unsuitable for standard therapy were enrolled. Pts received escalating doses of BI 1810631 BID (starting dose: 15 mg) or BI 1810631 QD (starting dose: 60 mg).<br \/>Phase Ib will initially include 30 pts with advanced HER2 tyrosine kinase domain mutation-positive, pre-treated NSCLC. Additional cohorts may be included in the future. Primary endpoints: MTD based on number of DLTs; number of pts with DLTs (Phase Ia); objective response (Phase Ib). Secondary endpoints: number of pts with DLTs throughout entire treatment period and PK parameters (Phase Ia\/Ib); duration of response, disease control, duration of disease control, and PFS (Phase Ib).<br \/>Results: As of 21 December 2022, 34 pts had been treated in the US, The Netherlands, Japan, and China. Pts had NSCLC (n = 21), colorectal cancer (n = 3), or other tumors (n = 10). Most pts had a pathological <i>HER2<\/i> mutation (n = 25). Pts received BI 1810631 15, 30, 60, 100, 150 mg BID (n = 3\/3\/4\/4\/3) or 60, 120, 180, 240 mg QD (n = 5\/4\/5\/3). Median number of cycles was 4 (range 1-14). Treatment is ongoing in 23 pts. To date, three DLTs have been observed (grade 2 edema [60 mg BID], grade 3 anemia [60 mg QD], grade 3 elevated ALT [180 mg QD]). The MTD has not been reached with either schedule. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported in 23 pts (68%). The most common TRAEs were diarrhea (n = 9), anemia (n = 5), increased alkaline phosphatase, increased creatinine, increased ALT, hypoalbuminemia (all n = 4), hypocalcemia, elevated AST, dry skin, increased GGT (all n = 3). Three pts had grade 3 TRAEs (anemia\/increased GGT [n = 1], increased ALT [n = 2]). In 29 pts evaluable for response the ORR (regardless of confirmation) was 34% (n = 10, all PRs; NSCLC: n = 8; esophagus, cholangiocarcinoma: n = 1). The DCR was 90%. In 19 NSCLC pts evaluable for response, the ORR was 42% and the DCR was 95%. Updated data will be presented at the meeting.<br \/>Conclusions: These preliminary data indicate that BI 1810631 is well tolerated and shows encouraging anti-tumor activity in pts with HER2 aberration-positive solid tumors.

SHR-A1811 is a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of a humanized HER2-directed monoclonal antibody, cleavable tetrapeptide-based linker, and DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor. Here, we report data from the phase 1 portion of a phase 1\/2 study with SHR-A1811 in patients with <i>HER2<\/i>-mutant NSCLC (NCT04818333).<br \/>Methods: In this single-arm, dose escalation and expansion phase 1 portion, patients with advanced activating<i> HER2<\/i>-mutant NSCLC who had failed platinum-based chemotherapy in the advanced or metastatic setting or could not tolerate chemotherapy were enrolled. SHR-A1811 was assessed at doses of 3.2, 4.8, 5.6, 6.4, and 8.0 mg\/kg intravenously once every 21-day cycle. Dose escalation and determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was guided by Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control. Dose selected for expansion was determined based on data from dose-escalation phase. The primary endpoints were safety, MTD and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).<br \/>Results: At data cutoff (Nov 8, 2022), 50 patients were enrolled. All were stage IV with a median of 3 (range 1-8) prior systemic treatments, including HER2-targeted TKI (66%), immune checkpoint inhibitors (68%), and anti-angiogenic drugs (78%). 96% had a HER2 kinase domain mutation. One patient in 8.0 mg\/kg dose cohort had dose-limiting toxicities (grade 4 febrile neutropenia and grade 4 thrombocytopenia). The 4.8 mg\/kg dose cohort was expanded to 38 patients. The median follow-up duration was 5.6 months (95% CI 4.2-7.0). 62% of patients remained on treatment. Overall, objective response rate was 40.0% (95% CI 26.4-54.8); median duration of response was 8.3 months (95% CI 5.4-13.7); disease control rate was 86.0% (95% CI 73.3-94.2); median progression-free survival was 10.8 months (95% CI 6.7-15.0). All patients had treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). 42% of patients experienced grade &#8805;3 TRAEs, with the most common ones being decreased neutrophil count (30%), decreased white blood cell count (20%), anemia (16%), and thrombocytopenia (12%). Nine patients (18%) had serious AEs deemed related to SHR-A1811. Treatment discontinuation due to AEs was reported in two patients. One death was reported to be treatment related (interstitial lung disease). After single dosing, dose exposure (C<sub>max<\/sub> and AUC<sub>last<\/sub>) of SHR-A1811 increased in a dose-proportional manner. PK parameters of SHR-A1811 and total antibody were similar at all dose levels, with low plasma exposure of free topoisomerase I inhibitor observed.<br \/>Conclusion: SHR-A1811 showed tolerable safety profile and durable antitumor activity in heavily pretreated patients with <i>HER2<\/i>-mutant NSCLC. Dose expansion at 4.8 mg\/kg and 5.6 mg\/kg is ongoing to establish the RP2D.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),HER2,NSCLC,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shun Lu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hong Jian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Hong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhengbo Song<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nong Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sheng Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zibin Liang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yongsheng Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Peng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>You Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiapeng Shuang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kaijing Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>.

Its therapeutic effect is associated with activation, expansion and tumor infiltration of SAg-binding specific T cells. Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody that blocks programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1).Initial data are reported from the dose escalation and MTD expansion parts of a phase 1b trial (NCT03983954), evaluating the safety and activity of NAP in combination with durvalumab in patients (pts) with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.<br \/>Methods: The primary objective was evaluating safety, tolerability, MTD\/ RP2D of NAP in combination with durvalumab. Secondary objectives included efficacy and duration of response based on RECIST\/iRECIST. Serum biomarkers were collected. Dose-escalation was used to determine the MTD\/RP2D. The MTD was the highest dose at which less than one-third of evaluable patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity. Patients were treated with NAP at 2, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mcg\/kg and durvalumab at a flat dose (1120 mg) in 21 days cycles using 3+3 design. Obinutuzumab pretreatment was employed to inhibit the formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) to NAP. Additional patients were enrolled at MTD; RP2D was determined based on the MTD, pharmacokinetics and biomarkers.<br \/>Results: 59 pts were enrolled, median age was 62 yrs (34-88), 56% female, ECOG 0 in 47% and 1 in 53%. 69% had pancreatic, ovarian or TN breast cancers. Pts received a median of 3 prior lines (0-6) and 7 pts (12%) received prior CPIs. AEs reported in 57 pts (97%) and included grade 1-2 infusion related reactions (IRRs) in 85%. 95% of IRRs occurred in cycles 1-2 and were rapidly reversible. Grade 3 IRRs occurred in 10%. Transient grade 1-2 elevations in liver enzymes occurred in 25% of pts. Treatment was discontinued due to toxicities in 4 pts (7%), at doses above RP2D. 23 patients were treated at the RP2D (10mcg\/kg). IRRs were reported in 21 pts (91%), grade 3 IRRs occurred in 4 pts, all limited to cycle 1. No pts discontinued treatment due to toxicities at the RP2D. 2 patients had CR (cervical who progressed on prior CPI and pancreatic cancer, 5 m and 35+ m respectively), 2 pts had PR (HCC who progressed on prior CPI and peritoneal mesothelioma, 24+ m and 13 m). Four pts (7%) had SD, with a median duration of 15 months (5-24+).<br \/>Conclusions: NAP RP2D was reached at 10 mcg\/kg. Antitumor activity with significant response duration was observed. Based on the favorable safety profile and prolonged responses, including CRs, in patients where response from a single agent CPI may not be expected, further evaluation of this combination is warranted including patients who have received prior CPI therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Checkpoint Inhibitors,Naptumomab Estafenatox,5T4,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ravit Geva<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Salomon Stemmer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruth Perets<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Corinne Maurice-Dror<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eitan Ben-Ami<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ari Raphael<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanjeev Kumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Ilana Lorber<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tal Hetzroni Kedem<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Scott Z.

Our study investigates the use of a novel OV with a Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) vector modified to express interferon-beta (IFN-b) and Tyrosinase Related Protein 1 (TYRP1) (VSV-IFNb-TYRP1). VSV is an attractive vector since humans are not naturally infected with VSV; thus, pre-existing immunity is minimal. IFN-b leads to increased T-cell responses and tumor cell apoptosis, while TYRP1, a melanocyte differentiation antigen, increases immunogenicity of the therapy. We conducted a Phase 1 clinical trial with a 3+3 design in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma. VSV-IFNb-TYRP1 was injected into a liver metastasis under image guidance, then administered on the same day as a single intravenous (IV) infusion. IV doses started at dose level (DL) 1 1x10<sup>10 <\/sup>TCID<sub>50<\/sub>, then escalated to DL2 3x10 <sup>10<\/sup>, DL3 1x10<sup>11<\/sup>, and DL4 3x10<sup>11<\/sup>. The dose delivered intratumorally (IT) varied based on the IV dose. The primary endpoints were safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Efficacy was a secondary endpoint. Correlative studies focused on understanding viral pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunological responses induced by VSV-IFNb-TYRP1 therapy. Twelve patients with previously treated metastatic uveal melanoma were enrolled. Median follow up was 19.1 months. Four DLs were evaluated with one patient at DL4 experiencing dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), including decreased platelet count (grade 3), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Non-DLTs at DL4 were fatigue, fever, CRS, hematological toxicities (decreased platelets and lymphocytes), and AST elevation. Four patients had stable disease (SD) and 8 had progressive disease (PD) as their best response. ELIspot data show that three of the four patients with response to TYRP1 also had a response to gp100, suggesting possible epitope spreading. These four patients received immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment as the next line of therapy, which led to clinical benefit for two patients. Our study evaluated VSV-IFNb-TYRP1 administered via IT and IV routes in a previously treated population of metastatic uveal melanoma patients and found no major safety events. Although there were no clear objective responses to VSV-IFNb-TYRP1, dose-dependent immunogenicity to melanoma antigens was seen. While OV response alone is not sufficient for clinical benefit, the evidence of epitope spreading is encouraging. Future studies of VSV-IFNb-TYRP1 will evaluate combinations with other therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic virus,Phase I,Uveal melanoma,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Katherine E.

Tebotelimab, also known as MGD013, is a PD-1\/LAG-3 bispecific tetravalent DART&#174; molecule with synergistic antitumor activity shown in preclinical studies. We conducted an open-label, single-arm, multi-cohort phase 1 study (NCT04653038) to assess the efficacy and safety of tebotelimab in melanoma patients (pts) including those with CPI-na&#239;ve mucosal melanoma.<br \/>Methods: The CPI-na&#239;ve cohort of this study enrolled pts with unresectable, recurrent or metastatic, mucosal or acral melanoma who had received no systemic therapy. Tebotelimab 600 mg was administered intravenously once every two weeks. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) assessed by independent radiologic review committee (IRC) per RECIST v1.1 in the efficacy analysis set consisting of pts who received &#8805;1 dose of tebotelimab. A <i>post-hoc <\/i>sensitivity analysis was conducted in the IRC-response evaluable set consisting of pts with IRC-assessed target lesions in the efficacy analysis set who received &#8805;1 post-baseline tumor assessment by IRC or died within 13 weeks after first dose. Results are reported for mucosal melanoma.<br \/>Results: At data cut-off (January 19, 2022), 25 pts with mucosal melanoma were enrolled (median age, 61 years; male, 40%; ECOG 1, 40%; TNM Stage IV, 92%; metastatic, 80%). LAG-3 expression level was &#8805;1% in seven (28%), &#60;1% in 15 (60%), and unknown in three (12%). PD-L1 expression was positive (CPS&#8805;1) in three (12%), negative (CPS&#60;1) in 19 (76%), and unknown in three (12%). All pts received &#8805;1 dose of tebotelimab. In the efficacy analysis set (n=25), three, three, and four pts achieved complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD), respectively, leading to a confirmed ORR of 24% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9-45), with median duration of response (DOR) not reached, and a disease control rate (DCR) of 40% (95% CI, 21-61). In the IRC-response evaluable set (n=20), three, three, and four pts achieved CR, PR, and SD, respectively, leading to a confirmed ORR of 30% (95% CI, 12-54), with median DOR not reached, and a DCR of 50% (95% CI, 27-73). Immune-related treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 11 (44%) pts, most commonly, hypothyroidism (20%), hyperthyroidism (16%), and white blood cell count decreased (12%). Grade &#8805;3 and serious treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported in three (12%) and four (16%) pts, respectively. TRAEs led to treatment discontinuation and death each in one (4%).<br \/>Conclusions: Tebotelimab demonstrated preliminary but promising antitumor activity and a tolerable safety profile in pts with untreated, unresectable, recurrent or metastatic, mucosal melanoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Immunotherapy,PD-1,Phase I,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Si Lu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meiyu Fang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhengyun Zou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Di Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhiguo Luo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jian Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gang Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongming Pan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiubao Ren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ying Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haichuan Su<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuan Xin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiong Hua<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianmei Hou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Guo<\/i><\/presenter>.
