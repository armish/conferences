[{"Abstract":"Purpose: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase enzyme inhibitors (PARPi) have become the standard-of-care treatment for homologous recombination deficient (HRD) high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). However, not all HRD tumors respond to PARPi and biomarkers to predict response are needed. [<sup>18<\/sup>F]FluorThanatrace (FTT) is a PARPi-analog PET radiotracer that non-invasively measures PARP-1 expression. Herein, we evaluate the ability of FTT uptake to serve as a biomarker to predict response to PARPi in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and patients with HGSOC.<br \/>Patients and Methods: In PDX models, FTT-PET was performed before and after PARPi (olaparib), ataxia-telangiectasia inhibitor (ATRi), or both. Changes in FTT were correlated with tumor size changes. Patients with HRD and HGSOC that were enrolled in CAPRI (PARPi+ATRi), LIGHT (PARPi only), or off-trial (PARPi only) were selected for this single-center, prospective, cohort, IRB-approved study. FTT-PET\/CT imagining was obtained from the skull base to the proximal thighs on an Ingenuity TF scanner (Philips Healthcare) 60-90 minutes after intravenous infusion of 8-12 mCi FTT. Subjects were imaged with FTT-PET at baseline and after ~1 week of PARPi monotherapy treatment. Target lesions (primary tumor and\/or metastases) were identified at the time of the baseline imaging on correlative anatomic imaging using RECIST 1.1 and maximum standardized uptake value (SUV<sub>max<\/sub>) data, normalized by body weight, was collected. Changes in FTT-PET uptake were compared to changes in tumor size, CA-125, and progression free survival (PFS).<br \/>Results: A decrease in FTT tumor uptake after 1 week of PARPi treatment correlated with response to PARPi+ATRi treatment in PARPi-resistant PDX models (r=0.81-0.83, P=0.1-0.22). In HGSOC patients (n=13), percent differences in FTT-PET after ~7 days of PARPi compared to baseline correlated with the first RECIST response (r=0.60, P=0.034), best RECIST response (r=0.75, P=0.01), best CA-125 response (r=0.73, P=0.033), and PFS (r=0.67, P=0.027). All patients with &#62;50% reduction in FTT uptake had &#62;6-month PFS and &#62;50% reduction in CA-125 (P=0.004 and P=0.016, respectively). Utilizing only baseline FTT uptake correlated to best RECIST response (r=-0.65, P=0.035) but did not predict response when corelated with other measures. Importantly, a decrease in FTT uptake does not appear to be associated with a reduction in tumor burden or apoptosis in response to drug cytotoxic activity at this early timepoint, indicating specificity for drug-target engagement.<br \/>Conclusions: The decline in FTT uptake shortly after PARPi initiation compared to baseline provides an in vivo measure of drug-target engagement and shows promise as an early biomarker to guide PARPi therapy. FTT-PET has both pre-clinical and clinical applications warranting further study, including guiding PARPi combination therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-05 Functional and molecular imaging,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PET,PARP inhibitors,Precision medicine,[18F]FluorThanatrace,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sarah B.

Lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) is one of the immune checkpoints for which therapeutic antibodies are being developed.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the safety of the radiolabeled LAG-3 antibody <sup>89<\/sup>Zr-DFO-REGN3767, to determine the optimal tracer dose and imaging time point, and to get insight into <sup>89<\/sup>Zr-DFO-REGN3767 whole body distribution.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> Patients with advanced solid tumors received 37 MBq <sup>89<\/sup>Zr-DFO-REGN3767 together with unlabeled antibody to achieve a 2, 5, 10, 20, or 40 mg total protein dose (NCT04706715). Patients underwent PET\/CT scans on days 0, 2, 4, and 7 after injection, followed by a tumor biopsy. After that, they received treatment with cemiplimab alone or combined with platinum-containing chemotherapy. PET scans were analyzed by placing volumes of interest (VOIs) in tumor lesions and normal tissues.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common, aggressive disease form that accounts for 30% of all lymphoma cases. The disease spreads systemically to involve organs other than lymph nodes 40% of the time, with 5-year survival of about 38% for intermediate grade disease. Recent development in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has shown tremendous promise in providing a cure to patients with relapsed\/refractory (R\/R) DLBCL. We propose to develop an image-based biomarker to identify patients that would respond to engineer edcell-based treatments.<br \/>Methods: We identified a cohort of 58 patients with R\/R DLBCL, whose largest lesions on the baseline positron emission tomography \/computed tomography (PET\/CT) imaging were identified along with their anatomical sites related to non-lymphatics. The lesion&#8217;s co-registered PET imaging was used to converge on a regional boundary to obtain the most active part of the lesion, applying Standardized Uptake Value definition with 41% regional threshold. The lesion regions were characterized using imaging metrics (radiomics) broadly categorized into: Size (n=38), Shape (n=9), Texture (n=259),followed by principal component (PC) analysis to reduce the dimensionality in each of the feature categories. These Radiomics metrics along with whole body metabolic tumor volume (MTV) were used both collectively and independently to assess risk to disease progression measured by overall survival using Cox-regression model. We also compared the Radiomic metrics to MTV to identify linear dependency measured by Coefficient of Determination (R<sup>2<\/sup>).<br \/>Results: PET scans shape features (extra nodal) that describes compactness to sphericity, represented as a principal component across the samples had a 21% increased risk to disease progression compared to 15% using MTV, with a CI of [1.0487, 1.417] and [1.04, 1.30] respectively. Patients have a median follow up of 1 year after CAR-T treatment. Shape-PC (Non-Lymph) lesions were not related to MTV with a correlation coefficient of 41.8% (R<sup>2<\/sup> of 0.0725). Most non lymphatic lesions (top three sites) in our cohort were from lung, bone and liver. Patients with no non- lymphatic lesions were not part of this cohort.<br \/>Conclusion: We identified Non-Size based features that are prognostic to patient response to treatment. These metrics provide complementary information to MTV and may serve as a surrogate to treatment response. Our features would require a secondary validation in a larger cohort prior to clinical use.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-08 Radiomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,Radiomics,Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yoganand Balagurunathan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Zhouping Wei<sup>1<\/sup>, Jin Qi<sup>1<\/sup>, Erin Dean<sup>1<\/sup>, Zachary Thompson<sup>1<\/sup>, Jung Choi<sup>1<\/sup>, Frederick Locke<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>H.

Nevertheless, owing to the heterogeneous nature of mCRPC, responses to LuPSMA therapy can be variable, and resistance is inevitable. As a result, biomarkers linked to clinical outcome with LuPSMA are urgently required. Using plasma ctDNA, we present the first comprehensive genomic analysis of a prospective cohort of mCRPC patients treated with LuPSMA. Targeted sequencing of 78 genes was performed on baseline plasma and matched buffy coat samples from patients who received LuPSMA on a prospective registry (NCT04769817). Reportable alterations included pathogenic single-nucleotide and copy number variants. Association between alterations and clinical outcomes were assessed using log rank, cox proportional, and chi-squared analyses. Clinical data collected included PSA decline by &#8805;50% or &#8805;90% (PSA50-response rate, PSA50-RR; and PSA90-RR), and PSA progression free survival (PSA-PFS). In total, 100 patients (median age 74 years, range 52-90) received a median of 4 cycles of LuPSMA. 83 patients had detectable ctDNA (median fraction 17%, range 0-94%) with PSA50-RR 50%, PSA90-RR 22%, and a median PSA-PFS of 7.2 months. Patients with an <i>AR<\/i> or <i>PTEN <\/i>aberration had significantly shorter PSA-PFS (HR 0.50 and 0.59, respectively; Table), as did patients with any <i>PI3K<\/i> pathway aberration (HR 0.56). Additionally, patients with a high ctDNA burden had significantly worse PSA-PFS (HR 0.42, Table). There were no significant differences in PSA-RR based on deleterious genomic changes. Our data reveal that aberrations in the <i>AR<\/i> and PI3K pathways, along with pre-treatment ctDNA fraction, whilst not linked to PSA-RR, are prognostic for durability of response to LuPSMA. If validated in larger cohorts, these data will help to optimise the use of LuPSMA by improving patient selection and enhancing prognostication.<br\/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{FC720E94-2584-4323-B4F0-C8856257935A}\"><caption>Analysis of clinical endpoints based on deleterious genomic changes in ctDNA<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri Light&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ascii-theme-font:major-latin;

Here we developed a new technology that can quickly identify the tumor area both in vivo and the resected breast tissue during the operation and distinguish the tumor boundary.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> 1. Characterization and biosafety of the probe SG-ICG were performed.2. The targeting of the probe was verified by in vitro fluorescence co-localization and flow cytometry experiment and in vivo fluorescence imaging using tumor-bearing mouse model.3. Fluorescence image-guided surgery in spontaneous breast cancer transgenic mice and transplanted tumor model were to evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of guided tumor resection with the probe.4. The tumors and peritumoral muscle tissues of tumor-bearing mice were surgically removed and incubated with SG-ICG, and then imaged by a NIR-II fuorescence imaging system. 5. Six surgically removed breast tissues were incubated with the probe immediately after intraoperative resection and imaged to identify the tumor area. The accuracy of fuorescence imaging was confirmed by pathological diagnosis.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>1. SG-ICG was successfully synthesized with good dispersibility, stability with high intensity of NIR-II fluorescent imaging. 2. SG-ICG could specifically target high expression level of Trop-2 in breast cancer cell lines compared with IgG-ICG.3. SG-ICG was able to detected the MDA-MB-231-luc breast cell tumor-bearing mouse models with tumor-to-background ratios of ~4, correspondingly, nearly 2-fold NIR-II FL signal decrease was detected while blocked by unlabeled SG. 4. SG-ICG was able to detected the minimal residual lesions and the minimum detectable tumor diameter is about 1mm. The NIR-II fluorescence guidance facilitated more complete tumor resection, it has improved the relapse free survival rate, and effectively discriminates between benign and malignant breast tissues in spontaneous breast cancer transgenic mice (AUC= 0.9931; 95% CI: 0.9708, 1.0;<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.0001)..5. This new technology yielded more than 83.33% specifcity and 100% sensitivity in identifying the tumor area in the resected breast tissue.<br \/><b>Conclusions <\/b>By using fuorescently labeled anti-human trop-2 antibody-drug conjugate to incubate freshly isolated tissues during surgery, the probes can quickly accumulate in breast cancer tissues, which can be used to quickly identify tumor areas in the resected breast tissues and distinguish tumor boundaries. This technology is expected to be used for rapid intraoperative pathological detection and margin determination.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-05 Functional and molecular imaging,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Trop-2,Fluorescence imaging,Diagnosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Weiling Chen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, YongQu Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, LiXin Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, XiangJie Luo<sup>1<\/sup>, YuanYuan Zhu<sup>1<\/sup>, GuiMei Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, YunZhu Zeng<sup>3<\/sup>, JiaZheng Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, RongHui Li<sup>4<\/sup>, WenHe Huang<sup>5<\/sup>, GuoJun Zhang<sup>5<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Xiamen University, Xiamen, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Pathology, Xiang'an Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Pathology, Cancer Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Medical Oncology, Xiang'an Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, China,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Breast-Thyroid-Surgery and Cancer Center, Xiang'an Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"672f9225-5f23-44fe-80f6-1ac90f8b2bc1","ControlNumber":"7655","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>W.

Two photon microscopy (TPM) techniques are well-suited to provide non-invasive high-resolution information on cell metabolism within three-dimensional tissue. Specifically, two-photon excited fluorescence imaging of autofluorescent cofactors, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), can be used to metabolically characterize cancerous tissue. The goal of this study is to utilize the optical redox ratio (ORR) of FAD\/[NADH+FAD] autofluorescence and NADH fluorescence lifetime decay to identify measurable differences in optical metabolic endpoints of human NSCLC that are indicative of their long-term outcome. Twenty-nine NSCLC specimens were obtained from the Lung Cancer Biospecimen Resource Network. They were resected from the lung prior to the patient receiving therapy. Clinical detail reports were used to evaluate the follow-up data of each patient and classify them into groups that reflected their eventual outcomes: responder (N=21), non-responder (N=18), non-metastatic (N=25), and metastatic (N=14). TPM was used to determine the ORR for each sample. NADH lifetime images were collected and fit to a biexponential model to separate the short (A1) and long (A2) components of free and bound NADH. We observed a significantly higher optical redox ratio for tumors within the metastatic group compared to non-metastatic. &#8203;This is consistent with previous findings from our lab that revealed increases in the ORR with increasing metastatic potential in cells, as well as other studies reporting a decrease in NADH concentration in metastatic cancers.&#8203; Additionally, a significantly shorter mean NADH lifetime in the metastatic tumor group was revealed when compared to non-metastatic. This stands in agreement with other studies highlighting decreases in the average lifetime of NADH in metastatic cells compared to non-metastatic. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using optical imaging of autofluorescence and lifetimes of metabolic cofactors to characterize treatment-na&#239;ve primary NSCLC tumors and determine differences in their optical metabolic endpoints that are indicative of their long-term outcome.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-05 Functional and molecular imaging,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Metastasis,Fluorescence imaging,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Paola Monterroso Diaz<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e2337e46-2c73-492c-a072-6c6d36a533d9","ControlNumber":"3827","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

Traditionally, &#947;H2AX and DNA damage response (DDR) factors have been used to detect DSBs using classical biochemical assays, such as antibody-based immunostaining. However, a reliable method to visualize and assess DSB activity real-time in living cells is yet to be established. Herein, we developed a novel DNA double-strand breaks biosensor (DSBS) based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) by employing the H2AX and BRCT1 domains. By applying FRET imaging with DSBS, we show that DSBS specifically reacts to drug- or ionizing radiation (IR)-induced &#947;H2AX activity, allowing for the quantification of DSB events at high spatiotemporal resolutions. Taken together, we provide a new experimental tool to evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of DNA double-strand breaks in response to cancer therapies. Ultimately, our biosensor can be useful for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying DNA damage and repair processes and applying for cancer therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-05 Functional and molecular imaging,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA double-strand break,H2AX,Imaging,Cancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jung-Soo Suh<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Tae-Jin Kim<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Pusan National University, Busan, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"126fdc70-4b9e-4627-b6a3-603f41269e5f","ControlNumber":"5503","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Approaches available in the clinic today, such as PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and tumor mutation burden (TMB), are insufficient for this task, in part as differences in microenvironments expressed by individual tumors may lead to heterogeneous response patterns. Recent efforts exploring the utility of quantitative imaging (radiomic) biomarkers to predict response to ICIs have shown promise to provide a more accurate and scalable method. In contrast to previously published models, our work focuses on generalizable models for predicting individual lesion-level as well as patient-level response at 3-month follow-up per RECIST criteria, using a large multi-institutional &#8220;real-world&#8221; dataset. The models combine radiomics features with demographic, molecular, and laboratory values routinely available in patients&#8217; electronic medical records. We analyzed radiomic characteristics of 6,295 primary and metastatic lesions from 1,206 metastatic NSCLC patients treated with anti-PD-1\/anti-PD-L1 ICIs from 8 institutions across the US and Europe. Patients with unavailable PD-L1 IHC, imaging follow-up, or with oncogenic driver mutations were excluded from analysis, resulting in a total dataset of 766 subjects randomly assigned to training (N=514) and validation sets (N=252). Using gradient-boosted decision tree algorithms, we developed a multi-modal predictive model to identify patients responding to ICI therapy at 3-months and evaluated its performance against an imaging-only CT radiomics model and the clinical standard of care, biopsy-based PD-L1 IHC. The multi-modal model contains CT radiomic features capturing lesion heterogeneity and spicularity, patient demographics, PD-L1 TPS, and tumor burden volume in the lung, lymph nodes, and the liver. Under the two-tailed DeLong test, the multi-modal model demonstrated statistically significant benefit over the current standard of care (PD-L1 IHC) in predicting multi-lesion 3-month response: 0.81 (P=.005) area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) in first-line ICI monotherapy patients, 0.72 (P=.044) in all-lines ICI monotherapy, and 0.71 (P=.025) in all-lines ICI-chemotherapy combination. The imaging-only model demonstrated predictive performance comparable to PD-L1 IHC: 0.71 (P=.226), 0.61 (P=.905), 0.62 (P=.674) on the same cohorts respectively. A multi-modal CT radiomics-based approach demonstrated predictive accuracy benefit over the current clinical standard and may provide an opportunity for more personalized patient management, such as risk-based escalation\/de-escalation of concurrent chemotherapy in NSCLC patients. We will evaluate this methodology in prospective studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-08 Radiomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Machine learning,Biomarkers,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Ravi  B.

These quantitative values can be used to develop predictive models for clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes. We evaluated radiomic features-based models as imaging biomarkers in NSCLC patients.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: 71 patients with NSCLC treated with immunotherapy who had pretreatment CT chest with contrast were retrospectively evaluated. The main tumor and 1cm-thick peritumoral space surrounding the tumor were manually segmented using LIFEx software (IMIV\/CEA, Orsay, France) by four physicians. Of 255 radiomic features collected, those with &#62;0.4 of Fleiss&#8217; kappa coefficient were selected. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm with mixed effects was used to develop multi-reader models and assess feature importance. The dataset was divided into a training set (75%) and a test set (25%). Bootstrapping with 1,000 iterations was conducted to estimate the model performance. Durable disease control was defined as having no progression of diseases per RECIST 1.1 up to 24 weeks from starting immunotherapy.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Among 71 patients, 35 (49.3%) are female and 36 (50.7%) are male. The median age was 66. 48 (67.6%) adenocarcinoma, 13 (18.3%) squamous cell carcinoma, and 10 (14.1%) other histologic types were included. 22 radiomic features were included based on importance in the prediction models from both the tumor and peritumoral space. Each model is trained to predict patients&#8217; durable disease control, TTF1 expression, PD-L1 expression, histology (adenocarcinoma or not), and Neutrophils Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR; greater than 5 or not) status. The statistical results from the models to predict clinical outcomes are shown in Table.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: The radiomic features-based models lack accuracy in predicting clinical characteristics and outcomes.

Surgical resection of the contrast enhancing (CE) region of HGG remains the mainstay of treatment, but recurrence inevitably arises from the unresected non-contrast enhancing (NE) region, surgically inaccessible due to cancer cell invasion into healthy brain tissue. Due to its critical role in recurrence, understanding of the NE region is central to the improvement of clinical outcomes. We reveal the biological characteristics of this region through image localized multi-regional sampling. We linked microenvironmental characteristics measured by multi-parametric MRI to genomic mutations and transcriptional phenotypes using mixed effect modeling which allowed us to control for individualized patient effects. We first confirmed that T2 is a significant indicator of IDH mutation status in the NE region, being the first description of such a relationship in a HGG cohort. We found the combination of EGFR amplification and CDKN2A homozygous loss was associated with a significantly lower mean diffusivity (MD) compared to double wild type tumors in the NE region, indicating the presence of greater cellular packing and proliferation in EGFR amplification\/CDKN2A loss regions. Finally, using single cell pathway based tumor classifications, we showed that nK2, a DSC-MRI metric representing cell size heterogeneity, correlated positively with neuronal signature and negatively with glycolytic\/plurimetabolic signature within the NE tumor, indicating that glycolytic\/plurimetobolic tumors possessed a high amount of cell size heterogeneity compared to neuronal samples. This hypothesis was supported using digital reference object (DRO) modeling which confirmed that cell size and heterogeneity drove the differential nK2 signal between neuronal and glycolytic\/plurimetabolic samples. We identified immune cell infiltrate as one possible mechanism of increased cell size heterogeneity using transcriptomic signature analysis which found more immune cell signatures within glycolytic\/plurimetobolic tumors compared to neuronal. Collectively this study demonstrates the central role of multi-parametric MRI as a non-invasive measure of tumor biology and a tool for understanding the clinically critical NE region which can then inform new therapies targeting this region of HGG recurrence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-08 Radiomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioma,Imaging,Magnetic resonance imaging,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Matthew Flick<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Taylor Weiskittel<sup>2<\/sup>, Kevin Meng-Lin<sup>3<\/sup>, Fulvio D'Angelo<sup>4<\/sup>, Francesca Caruso<sup>5<\/sup>, Shannon Ensign<sup>6<\/sup>, Mylan Blomquist<sup>7<\/sup>, Luija Wang<sup>8<\/sup>, Christopher Sereduk<sup>9<\/sup>, Gustavo De Leon<sup>10<\/sup>, Ashley Nespodzany<sup>11<\/sup>, Javier Urcuyo<sup>12<\/sup>, Ashlynn Gonzalez<sup>11<\/sup>, Lee Curtin<sup>12<\/sup>, Kyle Singleton<sup>12<\/sup>, Aliya Anil<sup>13<\/sup>, Natenael Simmineh<sup>14<\/sup>, Erika Lewis<sup>15<\/sup>, Teresa Noviello<sup>16<\/sup>, Reyna Patel<sup>17<\/sup>, Panwen Wang<sup>9<\/sup>, Junwen Wang<sup>18<\/sup>, Jennifer Eschbacher<sup>13<\/sup>, Andrea Hawkins-Daarud<sup>9<\/sup>, Pamela Jackson<sup>9<\/sup>, Kris Smith<sup>13<\/sup>, Peter Nakaji<sup>19<\/sup>, Bernard  R.

Most screen-detected breast cancers are early stage, hormonal receptor-positive, HER2-negative (HR+ HER2-) breast cancers. The majority of HR+ HER2- cancers are assigned to molecular intrinsic subtypes of Luminal A and Luminal B, which generally harbour low recurrence risk, with Luminal B cases being more invasive but still less aggressive than HER2-enriched or Basal-like subtypes. However, some of these Luminal cancers later recur (5+ years after diagnosis) often as advanced and\/or metastatic disease. We studied a cohort of screen-detected breast cancers (42 cases) at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre (Toronto, ON Canada) with integrated cross-platform radiomics, molecular and proteomic analysis in an attempt to better characterise these cancers and their proclivity for late recurrence. Utilising a Nanostring 200-gene assay, the molecular subtypes (PAM50 and MammaTyper-like) and a range of recapitulated clinical prognostic scores (50-Gene, 70-Gene and 21-Gene Risk) were determined for these cancers. While a majority of cases (29 out of 42) were subtyped as Luminal A cancers by PAM50, a fraction (12 out of 29) of these were either subtyped as Luminal B\/HER2+ based on MammaTyper-like results, or measured as intermediate to high risk of recurrence based on the 70-Gene or 21-Gene Risk classification. Although discordant results from multi-parametric assays are not uncommon, we postulate that here, discordance could suggest presence of heterogeneous cellular or molecular elements with invasive phenotype that could lead to aggressive transformations in the long run. Differential expression analysis between Luminal A cases with consistent subtyping and low risk prognostication and those with discordant subtyping or prognostication results revealed a panel of genes with significant changes in expression. Further analysis of RNA expression of these genes via Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrated that some genes showed high Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores in the classification between the two groups of Luminal A breast cancers, further supporting the existence of distinct molecular phenotypes. Targeted sequencing with Oncomine Comprehensive Assay V3 did not reveal particular mutational patterns between the two Luminal A groups. Nevertheless, radiomic analysis of mammographic images of the cancer, as well as single cell phenotyping of the tumor microenvironment with protein multiplexing will be incorporated to further characterise elements that are phenotypically different, and potentially identify mechanistic drivers contributing to late recurrence in Luminal A cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-07 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Luminal A,multiomic,prognostication,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alison  M.
