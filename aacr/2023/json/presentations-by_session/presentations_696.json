[{"Abstract":"Prostate cancer is traditionally considered an immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor type rendering patients insensitive to immunotherapy. Targeting surface antigens on tumors through cellular therapy can induce a potent anti tumor immune response to &#8220;heat up&#8221; the tumor microenvironment. However, many antigens expressed on prostate tumors are also found on normal tissues, potentially causing on-target, off-tumor toxicities and a sub-optimal therapeutic index. Our target discovery and validation efforts identified STEAP2 as a superior prostate antigen for therapeutic targeting. Importantly, STEAP2 is a highly prevalent prostate cancer antigen displaying high, homogeneous cell surface expression across all stages of disease. A novel lead generation approach facilitated the development of a potent and specific armored STEAP2 CAR-T therapeutic candidate, AZD0754. This second generation CAR-T product is armored with a dominant-negative TGF&#946;RII, thereby bolstering activity in the TGF&#946;-rich immunosuppressive environment of prostate cancer. Armored STEAP2 CAR-T cells demonstrate favorable in vitro properties, robust dose dependent in vivo efficacy in STEAP2 expressing cell line- and patient derived- mouse xenograft models and encouraging preclinical safety. Taken together, this data builds confidence in the specificity and potency of this potential first in class STEAP2 targeted CAR-T therapy and supports future clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Tumor antigen,Prostate cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Dewald Van Dyk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Zanvit<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christine Fazenbaker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelly McGlinchey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weichuan Luo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jessica Pezold<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Meekin III<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chien-ying Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Benjamin Clark<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philip L.

However, IFN&#947; effects on non-tumor cells (e.g., stroma and blood vessels) that could indirectly impact the therapy are not well characterized. We aim to dissect the spatiotemporal effects of IFN&#947; in the tumor microenvironment in ACT and the underlying mechanism of the therapy. An ACT using<i> ex vivo<\/i>-activated ovalbumin (OVA)-specific OT-1 T cells suppressed the growth of MCA-205-OVA-GFP fibrosarcoma or MOC2-SIINFEKL oral squamous cell carcinoma in wild-type mice. However, in IFN&#947;R1-deficient hosts, the ACT failed, indicating that non-tumor cells were crucial targets of IFN&#947;. Furthermore, the efficacy was also abrogated in bone-marrow chimeras generated by transferring the wild-type bone-marrow to lethally irradiated Tie2-Cre-Ifngr1<sup>flox\/flox <\/sup>mice. As IFNgR1 expression is specifically deficient in endothelial cells in these chimeras, this result indicates that IFN&#947; action on endothelial cells is indispensable for ACT. Early after T cell transfer (1.5 days), the fraction of OT-1 T cells infiltrating the tumor was small (0.098% of CD45<sup>+ <\/sup>cells) but produced high IFN&#947; (36.3%), resulting in the peak IFN&#947; concentration (47.3 pg\/ml) in the whole tumor tissue in a 7-day observation period. In contrast, the highest accumulation of OT-1 T cells with low IFN&#947; production (2.9%) was observed on Day 4.5. Intravital imaging revealed that at Day 1.5, IFN-&#947;-RES-YFP-OT-1 T cells with a high level of IFN&#947; secretion (strong YFP<sup>+<\/sup> signal) localized mainly along the tumor vessels. While more OT-1 T cells were observed in the MCA-205-OVA-GFP tumor tissue near the blood vessels on Day 4.5 than on Day 1.5, their IFN&#947; secretion was minimal. Degeneration of endothelial cells was observed via electron microscopy 3-4.5 days after T cells transfer. Consistent with this finding, CD31<sup>+<\/sup> endothelial cell density decreased on Day 4.5 compared to Day 1.5 and significantly reduced blood perfusion in the entire tumor as observed by near-infrared imaging after IR800-albumin infusion. H&#38;E staining of tumor sections showed tumor necrosis on Day 4-7. In summary, our study demonstrates that endothelial cell targeting of CD8 T cell-derived IFN&#947; is critical for tumor suppression in ACT, impairing blood perfusion. These results provide novel insights into the mechanism of ACT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interferons,Endothelial cells,T cell,In vivo imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Qiaoya Lin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Colleen Olkowski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter L.

Previous research findings indicate &#947;&#948;2 T cells are involved in tumor surveillance by responding to phosphoantigen overexpressed by most of cancers. The antibody cell conjugation (ACC) technology has the advantage to link cancer-targeting antibodies on cell surface of immune cells without genetic modification. This study applies ACC technology to generate an off-the-shelf EGFR-targeting &#947;&#948;2 T cell therapy ACE2016, and presents the promising potency of ACE2016 against EGFR-expressing cancer cells.<br \/>Methods: &#947;&#948;2 T cells were expanded from healthy donor PBMCs and &#945;&#946; T cell population were depleted. Both &#947;&#948;2 T cells and &#945;EGFR were covalently conjugated to selected DNA aptamers that enable DNA hybridization to generate EGFR-targeting &#947;&#948;2 T cells, ACE2016. The characteristics and antibody conjugation of ACE2016 was evaluated by flow cytometry, and <i>in vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity and <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor potency was investigated using luminescence-based cytotoxicity assay and the orthotopical model with EGFR-expressing cancer cells, respectively.<br \/>Results: ACE2016 showed nearly 100 % of &#945;EGFR antibody conjugation and exhibited EGFR-specific binding activity. These features conferred ACE2016 with enhanced <i>in vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity against EGFR-expressing cancer cells compared to unconjugated &#947;&#948;2 T cells, while ACE2016 and &#947;&#948;2 T cells showed no significant difference of anti-tumor potency against EGFR-negative cancer cells. Further characterization studies demonstrated that co-cultured with target cells significantly activated ACE2016 along with enhanced degranulation and cytokine production without measurable IL-6 secretion. Moreover, ACE2016 suppressed EGFR-expressing breast cancer cells <i>in vivo<\/i> in the orthotopic xenograft model without weight loss or toxicological observations.<br \/>Conclusion: ACE2016, an EGFR-targeting &#947;&#948;2 T cell product, was successfully generated as an effective off-the-shelf treatment for EGFR-expressing solid tumors. This study provides the evidence for the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of ACE2016 against EGFR-expressing cancer cells to support the clinical application against EGFR-expressing tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Gamma-delta lymphocytes,EGFR,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hao-Kang Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tai-Sheng Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pei-Ru Leng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi-Chiu Kuo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zih-Fei Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chia-Yun Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan-Liang Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sai-Wen Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shih-Chia Hsiao<\/i><\/presenter>.

In particular, an engineered T cell therapy, namely chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, is a more aggressive way to modify T cells to recognize cancer cells and destroy them. Although these CAR-T therapies have shown remarkable clinical responses in patients with hematological malignancies, their efficacy in solid tumor treatment has been disappointing due to many challenges: lack of tumor-specific antigen targets, loss of the CAR T-cell persistence, the inability of CAR-T cells to effectively infiltrate into solid tumors, toxicities of cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicity, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). In this regard, we report here that we have successfully developed a CAR-T cell therapy, referred to as EU307, to treat one type of solid tumor, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). EU307 is a fourth-generation CAR-T therapy that targets the HCC-specific tumor antigen of glypican-3 (GPC3), and also secretes IL-18 which results in autocrine co-stimulation of CAR-T cells and reprogramming of the TME into a tumor-killing environment. Through a sophistically optimized manufacturing process in our good manufacturing practices (GMP) facility, we are able to manufacture CAR-T cells with stem cell memory (TSCM) and central memory (TCM) phenotypes. Functionally, EU307, when infused with as little as 0.1 X 10<sup>6<\/sup> total cells per animal, showed superior <i>in vivo<\/i> persistence and antitumor immunity in an HCC tumor-bearing mouse model. Furthermore, a single dose toxicity study in the same disease mouse model determined the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) as 5.0 X 10<sup>5<\/sup> total cells per male and 1.0 X 10<sup>6<\/sup> total cells per female. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that we have a developed a novel fourth-generation CAR-T therapy to treat HCC, a solid tumor that expresses a high-level of tumor-specific GPC3, by overcoming previously limiting factors in the development of CAR-T therapies against solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Glypican-3,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Joseph H.

To enable adoptive immunotherapy against HER2-amplified CRC, we therefore considered a combinatorial strategy based on the synNotch-based artificial regulatory network. A synthetic Notch receptor was employed in which the extracellular domain is an anti-HER2 scFv and the intracellular domain contains the GAL4-VP64 artificial transcription factor. Engagement of the anti-HER2 domain by target cells drives GAL4-VP64 cleavage and translocation to the nucleus, where it drives expression of a CAR under a GAL4-responsive promoter. In this way, only cells co-expressing both HER2 and the CAR target are killed. As a CRC-specific CAR target we selected CEA, product of the CEACAM5 gene. CEA expression is restricted to the digestive tract and is increased in cancer. For the generation of HER2-synNotch CEA-CAR effectors, we chose the natural killer cell line NK-92 and transduced it with two lentiviral vectors, encoding respectively the HER2 synNotch and the second-generation anti-CEA CAR with CD28 costimulatory domain. Transduced cells were repeatedly sorted in the ON and OFF state to select those with the best CAR induction after synNotch engagement; cloning of sorted cells led to identification of an optimally responsive clone (clone 5F), showing no basal CEA-CAR expression and massive induction in the presence of HER2-overexpressing cancer cells. In vitro, the 5F clone displayed selective cytotoxicity against HER2++\/CEA++ CRC cells, with minimal killing activity against HER2++\/CEA- breast cancer cells, or against CRC cells expressing CEA but without HER2 amplification. In vitro 3D models highlighted better recruitment and infiltration by NK-92 clone 5F respect to NK-92 WT cells, only of HER2++ organoids. In vivo, the clone 5F significantly impaired tumor growth in two different HER2++ CRC models. The observed selective efficacy both in vitro and in vivo of the HER2-synNotch\/CEA-CAR approach opens a perspective for possible clinical applications in cases of HER2-amplified CRC displaying primary or secondary resistance to HER2\/EGFR blockade.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive immunotherapy,Preclinical testing,Chimeric antigen receptor,Natural killer cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Marco Cortese<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erica Torchiaro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Federica Invrea<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Consalvo Petti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alice D'Andrea<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sabrina Arena<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Enzo Medico<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

A major obstacle to developing targeted therapies against solid malignancies is the identification of targets that are abundantly and broadly expressed on tumor cells while exhibiting an absence of expression on high toxicity risk normal tissues. Logic-gated CAR T cells that inducibly express CAR upon recognition of a target antigen by a secondary engineered priming receptor (PrimeR) offer a novel approach to permit conditional killing activity in the presence of two antigens. Here, we identify PSMA and CA9 as attractive priming and cytolytic antigen targets, respectively, in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Using a bioinformatic discovery path, we show PSMA and CA9 mRNA are co-expressed in 94% of ccRCC tumors (n=530, TCGA). Immunohistochemical (IHC) assessments further reveal robust membranous PSMA and CA9 protein coexpression in 80% of ccRCC (n=416). Expression of CA9 and PSMA was evaluated across disease stage and co-expression was confirmed throughout disease progression. Distant metastases similarly showed evidence of common expression. In contrast, IHC assessment of normal tissues revealed limited membranous coexpression of PSMA and CA9 in normal high-risk toxicity tissues.

However, current treatment regimens require high dose IL-2 administration to support TIL survival, which limits their clinical applications due to IL-2 related toxicity. Obsidian Therapeutics is engineering TIL with membrane bound IL-15 (mbIL15) to eliminate the dependence of TIL on exogenous IL-2, potentially enhancing the tolerability of TIL therapies. Because there is a high unmet medical need in patients with tumors colder than melanoma, we evaluated mbIL15-engineered TIL expansion and functionality from colorectal cancer (CRC) and sarcoma biopsies. Using an IL2-independent, proprietary rapid expansion process (REP) we successfully expanded mbIL15-engineered TIL from both CRC and sarcoma, despite significantly lower T-cell numbers in the tumor tissues (average of 12-15% CD45+ TIL versus 64% in melanoma). mbIL15-engineered TIL showed an enrichment for CD8+ T cells throughout the REP and high T cell receptor variable beta chain (TCR Vbeta) diversity. mbIL15-engineered TIL also exhibited lower immune checkpoint expression (LAG3\/PD-1) and higher activation marker expression (CD25\/CD27\/CD28) when compared with unengineered TIL expanded from the same tumors using a conventional REP with IL-2. mbIL15-engineered TIL were polyfunctional, as defined by expression of more than one effector molecules (CD107a, perforin, interferon gamma (IFN-&#947;), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;), and granzyme b) in response to CD3\/ CD28 stimulation. To examine the cytotoxic function of mbIL15-engineered TIL, we developed autologous cell lines from the same tumors that were used to generate the TIL. Using whole exome and RNA sequencing we found that the autologous tumor cell lines maintained expression of conserved tumor antigens and HLA-expression when compared with the primary tumor. When co-cultured with the autologous tumor cell lines, mbIL15-engineered TIL secreted higher levels of IFN-&#947; and induced higher cytotoxicity as compared to unengineered TIL cultured with IL-2. Taken together, these data demonstrate that mbIL15-engineered TIL can successfully be expanded from comparatively &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors with low T-cell infiltration, such as CRC and sarcoma, while maintaining high TCR diversity and polyfunctionality and demonstrating higher cytokine production and cytotoxic activity against autologous tumor lines, compared to conventional TIL with IL2.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Zheng Ao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carmela Passaro<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bulent A.

Beyond the types of genetic modifications to CAR\/TCR T cells, there is a growing body of literature demonstrating that relatively simple preconditioning protocols can also be used to improve T cell fitness\/function. We studied, the impact that preconditioning in elevated concentrations of leucine, glutamine, and arginine has on the killing efficacy and bioenergetics of MART-1-specific TCR T cells.<br \/>Methods: Using the Agilent xCELLigence RTCA eSight and Seahorse we assessed the killing efficiency and bioenergetics of engineered T-cells after Arginine, Glutamine, and Leucine pre-conditioning using MART-1 specific TCR T cells. CD3<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells (Hemacare, Seattle, WA) were transduced with retrovirus SAMEN-DMF5 with a CD34 marker gene, against MART-1. The T cells were pre-conditioned in a range of concentrations varying between 0-6mM for 7 days, followed by a killing assay using MART-1 expressing melanoma cell line as target cells (624.38) engineered to express a red-fluorescent nuclear protein. The comparison was made with transduced T-cells grown in RPMI (no added amino acid supplementation denoted as RPMI_TCR), RPMI supplemented with Arginine (Arg_TCR) and non-transduced T cells. The T cell killing was measured using impedance\/imaging-based assays. CD34 assessment was performed using Novocyte and SRC (spare respiratory capacity) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were measured using seahorse assays.<br \/>Results: Whereas supplementing the growth medium with 6 mM Arginine increased killing efficacy dramatically (up to &#61566;6-fold), elevated leucine and glutamine concentrations were found to have minimal impact on MART-1 TCR T cell killing of melanoma cells. Arginine (6 mM) supplementation increased basal respiration, ATP linked OCR, and maximal respiration compared to the RPMI control. SRC of Arg_TCR T cells was significantly higher than RPMI preconditioned T cells, a parameter previously correlated with T cell persistence. To check the effect of a shortened pre-conditioning period, 2, and 4 days of pre-conditioning were done along with the 7 days method. After a preconditioning step of only 2 days, Arginine preconditioned T cells acquired a killing efficacy that is &#62;2x higher compared to their counterparts RPMI_TCR T cells. Extending the duration of preconditioning from 2 to 4 days has minimal impact on the RPMI control T cells but more than doubles the killing efficacy of the high Arg grown T cells.<br \/>Conclusions: In conclusion, Arginine pre-conditioning significantly improved T cell potency and mitochondrial respiration through metabolic rewiring.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Immunotherapy,Metabolism,Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Rashmi R.

However, MANAs are present at ultra-low densities on the cancer cell surface (as few as 1-2 copies per cell), leading to the challenge of eliciting a sufficiently robust therapeutic effect. We combined components of both T cell receptors (TCRs) and chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to create a new receptor with improved potency against an ultra-low-density MANA. From CARs, we utilized the antibody-based antigen recognition domain (i.e. the single chain variable fragment, scFv) and the integrated co-stimulation that amplifies T cell activation. From TCRs, we utilized the multi-chain signaling platform that facilitates high antigen sensitivity. This new receptor, termed a TCR Embedded ScFv for Long-term Activation (TESLA), showed promising characteristics when tested with the H2-scFv which targets the p53 R175H mutation presented on HLA-A*02:01 (R175H\/A2). Using CRISPR-based homology directed repair in primary human T cells, we tested 15 configurations of appending the H2-scFv to subunits of the TCR complex to identify a design that maximized T cell cytotoxicity and interferon gamma release in co-cultures with cancer cells expressing endogenous levels of the R175H\/A2 antigen. In this system, we showed that the optimal TCR-embedded configuration of the H2-scFv produced similar levels of cytotoxicity and interferon gamma secretion as patient-derived TCRs targeting the same R175H\/A2 MANA, while conventional H2-CARs were unable to produce any T-cell activation. We then used a multiple stimulation co-culture system to identify a co-stimulation domain combination (MyD88 and CD40) that improved serial cytotoxicity and proliferation of H2-TESLAs when incorporated on the intracellular side of the TCRbeta chain. Finally, we compared the H2-TESLA receptor to patient-derived TCRs modified with the same MyD88 and CD40 co-stimulation domains. In vivo, H2-TESLAs cured all mice in a tumor model, while co-stimulation-modified TCRs produced only temporary tumor control. Moreover, in vivo, H2-TESLAs elicited 100-fold greater T cell expansion than co-stimulation-modified TCRs. In conclusion, we demonstrated that by combining aspects of both CARs and TCRs, the TESLA receptor improved T cell reactivity against an ultra-low-density neoantigen compared to conventional CARs and patient-derived TCRs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Chimeric antigen receptor,Neoantigens,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brian J.

However, TIL therapy has conventionally required co-administration of IL2, which is associated with toxicity in patients. We previously showed that melanoma TILs engineered to express membrane-bound IL15 (mbIL15) under the control of the ligand acetazolamide (ACZ) can achieve IL2-independent expansion during manufacturing, antigen-independent persistence <i>in vitro<\/i> and anti-tumor efficacy <i>in vivo<\/i>. In the current study, we extend the cytoTIL15 cell therapy product concept to indications beyond melanoma including non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), tumor types which represent significant unmet medical needs, particularly in the post-checkpoint inhibitor refractory setting. TILs from primary NSCLC, HNSCC and TNBC were engineered to express mbIL15 in the presence of ACZ and expanded in the absence of IL2 using our proprietary rapid expansion protocol (REP). CytoTIL15 cells were predominantly CD8 positive, enriched for mbIL15 expression and maintained T cell receptor variable beta chain (TCRV&#946;) diversity throughout expansion. <i>In vitro<\/i> antigen- and cytokine-independent survival and polyfunctionality of cytoTIL15 cells was measured from cultures that included ACZ. To assess anti-tumor activity, cytoTIL15 cells were co-cultured with autologous patient-derived cell lines (PDc) or tumor digests from patient-derived xenografts (PDx), and cytotoxicity and IFN&#947; release into supernatant was measured. <i>In vitro,<\/i> cytoTIL15 cells + ACZ exhibited similar or increased polyfunctionality compared to unengineered TIL + IL2. Unlike unengineered TILs, cytoTIL15 cells + ACZ persisted in an antigen-free setting without IL2, were cytotoxic to autologous PDc and released IFN&#947; in response to autologous PDx tumor digest. Taken together, these data show that IL2-independent, fully functional cytoTIL15 cells can successfully be generated from tumors such as NSCLC, HNSCC &#38; TNBC, which afflict large numbers of patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Immuno-oncology,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kyle D.

Our previous study showed that EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII)-targeting monovalent CAR T cells reduced target-positive tumor cell populations, but tumor recurrence resulted from target-negative tumor cells, highlighting the limitation of single-target approaches in heterogenous tumors. With regards to the highly immunosuppressive TME in GBM, we found that transforming growth factor-&#946; (TGF&#946;) was present in the GBM TME as a major driver of suppression of the anti-GBM response in clinical samples. TGFb is consistently highly expressed in both GBM tumor cell lines and patient tumor tissues.<br \/>Methods: We used two parallel scFv constructs, independently targeting both IL13R&#945;2 and EGFRvIII, in combination with a truncated dominant negative (dn) TGF&#946; receptor II. This trivalent construct was designed to explore possible additive effects in both in vitro and in vivo GBM model systems to limit tumor escape and overcome the immunosuppressive GBM TME. The CART-EGFR-IL13R&#945;2-dnTGFb construct broadened the targeted tumor cell repertoire, blocked TGF&#946; signaling, and served as a sink for free TGF&#946; in the GBM TME to overcome the suppressive function of TGF&#946;.<br \/>Results: The tri-modular CAR T construct had an enhanced proliferative response when compared with the CART-EGFR-IL13R&#945;2 construct, <i>in vitro<\/i>. In co-culture assays, this construct led to reduced PD-1 expression and increased central memory phenotype, when compared to the bicistronic CAR T construct, which suggested a lower fraction of exhausted T cells. Tri-modular CAR T cells blocked the suppressive pSmad2\/3 signaling pathway, leading to the increased tumor killing activity in co-culture experiments with both adherent and suspension GBM cell lines. In an immunodeficient mouse model, tri-modular CAR T cells eradicated tumor cells efficiently and mice had a longer median survival when compared those treated with the bicistronic CART-EGFR-IL13R&#945;2 cells, lacking the dnTGFb receptor II.<br \/>Conclusion: Overcoming the adaptive changes in the local TME and addressing antigen heterogeneity will be required to improve the clinical efficacy of CAR T-directed strategies. Our combination work<br \/>showed that bicistronic CART constructs cooperate with truncated TGF&#946; receptor II efficiently. In summary, the dominant-negative TGF&#946; RII CART-EGFR-IL13R&#945;2 structure is a promising strategy to address the clinical challenges of antigenic heterogeneity and the immunosuppressive TME in GBM we have observed in our two GBM CART cell trials at UPenn.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Immunotherapy,TGF-&#946;,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nannan Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jesse Rodriguez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zev Binder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Donald O’Rourke<\/i><\/presenter>.

Due to the relatively low occurrence of side effects and sustained success, these therapeutic techniques have gradually replaced the traditional cancer treatment regimen. The creation of an <i>in-vitro<\/i> screening platform for pre-evaluating the efficacy of immunotherapeutic drug candidates was highly essential despite the fact that many of the new emerging therapies had failed clinical trials.An <i>in-vitro<\/i> platform mirroring the interaction between a patient's unique Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) and T-cell receptor (TCR) is necessary for predicting the precise efficacy of immunotherapies. The tumor cells' MHC antigen molecule attaches to the T-cell receptor (TCR), allowing T-cells to manifest their tumor-killing activities as a result. The link between immunological checkpoint (ICP) in tumor cells and their receptors in T cells allows tumor cells to evade the effects of T-cell-mediated tumor death.We would like to introduce our \"ODISEI\" platform, a robust efficacy evaluation tool that enables the recapitulation of a patient's unique immune system, utilizing tumor organoids and PBMC from the same donors. Using PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibiting antibodies, the enhanced functionality of our ODISEI platform as an effective evaluation platform for immunotherapy drugs was thoroughly examined. Additionally, we created several ODISEI platforms in order to recreate the precise interactions between tumor organoids and various immune sub-populations (T-cells, macrophages, regulatory T-cells, and dendritic cells). Our ODISEI platforms were validated by utilizing a variety of different drug candidates and evaluating their ability to eradicate tumors upon interaction with various reactive immune cells and tumors. As a result, our highly innovative ODISEI platform can be used to screen a variety of different immunotherapeutic drug candidates and distinguish their precise efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Immunotherapy,Organoids,Drug-discovery screen,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Boeun Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Woo Kyeom Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarang Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hee-Ra Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Donghyeon Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jongman Yoo<\/i><\/presenter>.

PD-1 blockade in combination with IL-2 is one of the most effective combination therapies in this very stringent LCMV mouse model of life-long chronic infection with irreversible T-cell exhaustion. Our paper makes the following points: First, we show that the more effective viral control seen after PD-1 + IL-2 combination therapy compared to PD-1 monotherapy is mediated by the CD8+ T-cell response. Then we identify the virus-specific CD8+ T cells that proliferate and respond to the combination therapy and show that these are the same lymphoid resident PD-1+ TCF-1+ stem-like CD8+ T cells that act as resource cells to maintain the CD8+ T-cell response during chronic infection and also respond to PD-1 blockade. However, the combination therapy dramatically changes the differentiation program of these chronic resource CD8+ T cells and results in the generation of transcriptionally and epigenetically distinct effector CD8+ T cells that resemble highly functional effector CD8+ T cells seen after an acute viral infection. In contrast, PD-1 monotherapy does not modify the differentiation program and one gets more virus-specific CD8+ T cells but they are transcriptionally and epigenetically similar to what is seen in untreated chronically infected mice. This epigenetic inflexibility of exhausted CD8+ T cells is a potential barrier to PD-1 therapy and the ability of this combination therapy to modify the epigenetic signature of virus-specific CD8+ T cells during chronic infection could be an important determinant of the striking synergy seen between IL-2 therapy and PD-1 blockade. We also highlight the importance of blocking the PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitory pathway at the target site for effective viral control. Expanding the CD8+ T cell population and generating better effector cells is important but it is also critical to block PD-1 inhibitory signals at the target site for optimal immunotherapy. Finally, we show that CD25 engagement with IL-2 plays an important and essential role in the observed synergy between IL-2 cytokine and PD-1 blockade. Either blocking CD25 with an antibody or using a mutated version of IL-2 that does not bind CD25 but still binds CD122\/132 almost completely abrogated the synergistic effects seen after PD-1\/IL-2 combination therapy. There is currently considerable interest in PD-1 + IL-2 combination therapy for cancer patients and our fundamental studies defining the underlying mechanisms of how IL-2 synergizes with PD-1 blockade should inform these human translational studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,PD-1,Interleukin-2,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Masao Hashimoto<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

To overcome stability and toxicity limitations seen with high dose cytokine immunotherapy, we developed a delivery platform, called cytokine factories, composed of genetically engineered epithelial cells encapsulated in biocompatible polymers. These clinically translatable cytokine factories are able to safely deliver high local doses of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-12 (IL12), and allow for controlled and predictable dosing <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Results: Tumor-adjacent administration of IL12-based cytokine factories <i>in vivo<\/i> created a high local cytokine concentration (IP space) without substantial leakage into the systemic circulation. In addition, administration of cytokine factories in combination with anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitors caused reduction of tumor burden by over 60% when delivered as a monotherapeutic to mice with metastatic melanoma (3). Further, when administered in combination with local anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitors, these cytokine factories led to reduction of intraperitoneal tumor burden by over 80% after only 10 days of treatment. Finally, we evaluated the ability of this therapy to treat pancreatic tumors which are notoriously known to be resistant to immunotherapy. We found that the median survival for control animals was 45 days. However, 8\/8 of animals treated with IL12 cytokine factories survived throughout the duration of the study (110 days), demonstrating a significant extension of overall survival time.<br \/>Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate efficacy of cytokine factories as single agent and combination therapeutics in preclinical animal models and provide rationale for future clinical testing for the treatment of metastatic peritoneal cancers in humans.<br \/>References: (1) H.

Agents that activate the IM by turning cold tumors hot may support ICB. The biguanides hexyl-benzyl-biguanide (HBB) and its bioisostere hexyl-(cuban-1-yl-methyl)-biguanide (HCB) are candidate agents to activate the IM because they potently inhibit biosynthesis of immunosuppressive epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and EET-driven oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), while blocking N-glycosylation of immune checkpoint (IC) proteins. We hypothesized that reversal of hypoxia by biguanides in the ovarian dependent ER+HER2- STAT1 KO SSM2<sup>ucd<\/sup> mouse mammary carcinoma (MC) model would suppress Tregs and promote effector T cells in the tumor IM. While the SSM2<sup>ucd<\/sup> model did not express immune checkpoint protein PD-L1 (B7-H1), it did express related IC proteins B7-H3 and B7-H4. We hypothesized that by inhibiting OXPHOS and reducing N-glycosylation of immune checkpoint proteins, HBB and HCB may promote efficacy of ICB. We chose the SSM2<sup>ucd<\/sup> model to test impact of HCB on the ER+ MC IM.<br \/>Results: SSM2<sup>ucd<\/sup> cells exhibited longer tumor latency (60 days) than the basal 4T1 (10 days) and 67NR (20 days) mouse MC models. SSM2<sup>ucd<\/sup> tumor reimplantation shortened latency by more than half, to 20 days. Immunohistochemistry showed that B7-H3 and B7-H4 protein levels were 1.2 (P=0.001) and 1.3-fold (P=0.04) higher in reimplanted tumors vs. control. In SSM2<sup>ucd<\/sup> cells, HCB inhibited N-glycosylation of B7-H3 (P=0.01) by 35% and B7-H4 (P=0.02) by 45% and suppressed TGF&#946; induction of B7-H3 by 21% (P=0.02) and B7-H4 by 79% (P=0.001) at 24 hours, while 14,15-EET promoted N-glycosylation of B7-H3 (1.2-fold; P=0.03) and B7-H4 (1.3-fold; P=0.04) at 4 hours. Effects of HBB and HCB on anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulated mouse splenocytes were assayed. The proliferative effects of HBB on CD4+ and CD8+ cells peaked at 12 uM (p&#60;0.001) and for HCB at 6.25 uM (p&#60;0.001). Tregs decreased with HCB at a threshold of 12 uM (p &#60;0.001) and with HBB at 25 uM (P &#60; 0.001) while 14,15-EET increased Tregs (1.2 fold; P=0.02) and suppressed the CD8+:Treg ratio (0.79; P=0.02). In the SSM2<sup>ucd<\/sup> mammary allograft model, although HCB 12mg\/kg daily did not inhibit tumor growth, it reduced intratumoral hypoxia by 20% (P=0.01), increased CD8+ TIL by 4.4-fold (P=0.04), decreased Treg:CD4+ TIL ratio by 76% (P=0.02), and decreased Treg:CD8+ TIL ratio by 88% (P=0.01) relative to control.<br \/>Conclusion: B7-H3 and B7-H4 expression inversely correlated with latency of ER+ MC and may represent targets for immune checkpoint antibodies and their drug conjugates. HCB, an inhibitor of OXPHOS and EET biosynthesis, reduced intratumoral hypoxia, increased CD8+ TIL and reduced the Treg:CD8+ ratio, potentially supporting ICB therapy of ER+ MC by turning cold tumors hot.

Following a data mining exercise of external publication data and additional clinical biomarker datasets, we found strong evidence concluding the potential role of Gal-1 in the establishment of a fibrotic tumor stroma and mechanisms associated with tumor invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. However, there was limited data regarding the role of Gal-1 in immune escape by tumors to make any strong conclusions\/pathway reconstruction around this specific TME mechanism of action (MOA). To further strengthen the potential role of Gal-1 in tumor immune evasion we completed a series of preclinical in vivo and in vitro activities, using a highly selective Gal-1 small molecule inhibitor developed at Galecto Biotech. <b><u><\/u><\/b> To examine the role of Gal-1 inhibition in vivo, we investigated the effects on tumor volume of the highly selective Gal-1 inhibitor, in a syngeneic mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma. RNA profiling of vehicle and compound treated tumors was also implemented following completion of the in-life phase. Oral administration of the Gal-1 inhibitor reduced mouse lung adenocarcinoma growth and increased the immune gene expression within the tumors, showing a strong association to that of exacerbated NK cell activity. No additional cytotoxic T cell gene changes were uncovered in the Gal-1 inhibitor treated tumors. We further evaluated the overall T cell compartment, relevant to the clinical TME setting, by stimulating human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMC&#8217;s) incubated with and without the Gal-1 inhibitor to observe the potential blockade of any known immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) resistance mechanisms. Interestingly, we found a variety of immune suppressive proteins to be inhibited, including IL-17, when hPBMC&#8217;s were incubated with the Gal-1 inhibitor. In summary, the data presented suggests highly selective Gal-1 inhibition could provide an effective, monotherapy (or be used in combination with ICI's) to boost immune infiltration and\/or activation in the TME of lung adenocarcinoma and potentially other aggressive cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Galectin-1,Immune checkpoint,Immunosuppression,Gene expression patterns,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ian Holyer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rob Slack<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristoffer Petersen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fredrik Zetterberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alison Mackinnon<\/i><\/presenter>.
