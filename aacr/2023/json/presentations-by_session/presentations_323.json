[{"Abstract":"Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is aggressive neuroendocrine cancer that accounts for approximately 15% of lung cancer. Although chemotherapy is effective for SCLC, resistant tumors develop rapidly; therefore, early detection in the initial screening and after chemotherapy is one of the critical issues in controlling SCLC progression. For this purpose, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and pro-gastrin-releasing peptide (ProGRP) are used as tumor markers for SCLC but are not sensitive enough, especially in the early stages. Previously we found that Cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) is highly expressed in SCLC, and an SCLC-specific splicing variant, CADM1v8\/9, is selectively cleaved by ADAM17 protease to release the extracellular fragments. Here, we report that soluble CADM1v8\/9 fragments (sCADM1v8\/9) can be a serum marker of SCLC associated with poor prognosis and metastasis. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the expression of CADM1 was observed in 83% of the resected SCLC cases and strongly correlated with that of INSM1, a marker of neuroendocrine differentiation. The high expression of CADM1 was associated with poor prognosis and nodal involvement, which was supported by experimental data showing that CADM1 promoted subcutaneous tumor growth and lymph node metastasis of SCLC cells in nude mice. Moreover, sCADM1v8\/9 distinguished 47% of SCLC, including a significant portion of patients with limited disease SCLC, independent of and partly overlapped with the cases detected by ProGRP or NSE. Notably, a high amount of sCADM1v8\/9 was observed in SCLC cases with liver metastasis or pleural effusion. Furthermore, serum levels of sCADM1v8\/9 well reflected the change in tumor burden before and after chemotherapy. These findings indicate that detecting sCADM1v8\/9 in sera would provide clinical benefits in diagnosis, follow-up, and metastasis prediction of SCLC cases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: small cell,Serum marker,Splice variants,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Takeshi Ito<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Toko Funaki<sup>1<\/sup>, Hiroko Iwanari<sup>2<\/sup>, Goh Tanaka<sup>3<\/sup>, Takahide Nagase<sup>3<\/sup>, Takao Hamakubo<sup>2<\/sup>, Yoshinori Murakami<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Div. of Molecular Pathology, Inst. of Medical Science, Univ. of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Dep. of Quantitative Biology and Medicine, Res.

The survival rate of patients with NSCLC is poor, with an overall 5-year survival rate of less than 30% (2). Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on tumor cells is a response predictor to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and has become a cornerstone of first-line therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC without targetable alterations (3). However, poor inter- and intra-observer concordance when reporting PD-L1 expression might imply patients receive suboptimal treatment (4). Here, we present an AI-based algorithm for the clinical scoring of tumor PD-L1 expression in NSCLC samples to support pathologists and increase scoring consistency. Methods: HALO PD-L1 AI was developed and validated on a subset of routine diagnostic cases stained with the SP263 PD-L1 clone. To obtain the whole slide percentage of PD-L1 tumor positive cells and report the tumor proportion score (TPS), a ResNet 18-based network was trained with 141354 expert annotations to classify cells as &#8216;PD-L1 tumor positive&#8217;, &#8216;PD-L1 tumor negative&#8217;, or as &#8216;other&#8217;. Prior to PD-L1 cell classification, the algorithm automatically removes artifacts and segments the tissue into tumor and benign regions. The algorithm was validated by comparing the TPS score from three pathologists with the TPS score obtained from HALO PD-L1 AI on 203 whole slide images. Results: The three pathologists were in complete agreement in 64.0% of the cases. In pairwise comparisons, percent agreement ranged from 74.9% to 77.3%. Agreement of HALO PD-L1 AI with the pathologists&#8217; mode was 73.4% overall, with specific agreement at the clinically relevant cut-offs ranging from 0.71 to 0.78. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between HALO PD-L1 AI and pathologists&#8217; TPS scores was 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.93 - 0.97). Conclusions: HALO PD-L1 AI is in agreement with pathologist TPS scores in routine diagnostic cases. Usage of HALO PD-L1 AI in a diagnostic setting has the potential to support pathologists scoring PD-L1, saving pathologists&#8217; time and ensuring consistency in the reported results.

OPN is an integrin binding phosphorylated glycoprotein involved in cell-mediated immunity, inflammation, cell survival, and tumor progression. MMP 2 is an extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling enzyme that breaks down the ECM and also facilitates cancer growth. OPN promotes ERK pathway and VEGF mediated tumor angiogenesis and progression. PGRN stimulates VEGF expression in breast cancer cells in vitro. This study&#8217;s goals were to assess: 1) preoperative (preOp) plasma PGRN, OPN and MMP 2 levels in CRC and benign pathology (BP) patients (pts.), 2) tumor mRNA expression, and 3) the diagnostic potential of these proteins.<br \/>Method: CRC and BP bowel resection pts enrolled in an IRB approved tissue bank for whom preOp plasma was available were studied. Basic demographic, clinical, operative, and pathology data were evaluated. Plasma PGRN, OPN and MMP2 levels (ng\/ml) were measured in duplicate via ELISA (results: median + 95%CI). Also, protein expression levels in tumors and paired normal tissue were determined for a subset of pts by QRT-PCR. CRC and BP plasma levels were compared by the Mann-Whitney test (significant &#60;0.05). The plasma receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were used to evaluate single and combined proteins levels.<br \/>Result: Plasma from 102 BP (adenoma 32%, diverticulitis 53%, other 15%) and 172 CRC (70% colon, 30% rectal) pts. were analyzed. The CRC Stage (STG) distribution was: STG-1, 25%; STG-2, 32%, STG-3, 31%, STG- 4, 12%. Median PreOp proteins levels in CRC patients for all 3 proteins were significantly higher than BP levels (PGRN; 54.71, CI: 51.82,57.12 vs. 43.32, CI: 40.10,46.89; OPN; 82.38, CI: 77.1,89.38 vs. 63.86, CI: 54.95,69.03; MMP2; 205.3 CI:198.2,217.15 vs. 165.3 CI: 156.83,179.06; P&#60;0.0001 for all). Plasma OPN levels were significantly higher in STG 4 pts vs STG 1 group ( p&#60;0.01). The percentage of tumors overexpressing these proteins were: PGRN, 8%; OPN, 77%; and MMP2, 59%. The single AUC values from the ROC curve for PGRN, OPN and MMP2 were 0.724, 0.703 and 0.721 with 71%, 77% and 73% specificity and with 63%, 55% and 64% sensitivity. The 3 protein combination achieved a specificity of 78% (AUC, 0.792) and sensitivity of 71%.<br \/>Conclusion: Median PGRN, OPN and MMP2 plasma levels in CRC pts were significantly higher (26%, 29% &#38; 24% respectively) than BP levels; the OPN and MMP2 increases may be related to tumor expression. Increased plasma PGRN and MMP2 may be the result of tumor angiogenesis and inflammation-induced tissue remodeling. OPN levels were increased in stage 4 pts. The 3 protein combination had improved AUC &#38; specificity vs single protein results. Further study is needed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Biomarkers,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chandana S.

Diagnosis and preoperative risk stratification of these patients present distinct challenges given the limitations of current available diagnostic tools, including endoscopic biopsy and imaging. Herein, we explore the feasibility and clinical performance of a urine-based epigenetic assay in the diagnosis of patients with UTUC.<br \/>Methods: Under an institutional review board-approved protocol, voided urine samples were prospectively collected using the Bladder CARE Urine Collection Kit (Pangea Laboratory LLC, CA, USA) from primary UTUC patients before any genitourinary manipulation between November 2019 and March 2022. All patients were confirmed to have UTUC in the final specimen. A 1:1 age\/sex-matched group of cancer-free healthy donors (control group) was also included in the study. &#8220;Healthy&#8221; status was based on self-reporting and defined as no history of any type of tumor. Urine samples were analyzed with Bladder CARE, a urine-based test that measures the methylation level of 3 urothelial cancer-specific biomarkers (TRNA-Cys, SIM2, and NKX1-1) and two internal control loci using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes coupled with qPCR. Results were reported as Bladder CARE Index (BCI) score and categorized as &#8220;positive&#8221; (BCI &#62; 5), &#8220;high risk&#8221; (2.5 &#60; BCI &#8804; 5) or &#8220;negative&#8221; (BCI &#8804; 2.5). Association between BCI score and category, and clinical and pathological findings was assessed.<br \/>Results: A total of 50 patients (40 males and 10 females) with a median age of 72 (64-79) years were included in the final analysis. Six patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Surgical procedures included RNU (n=40), ureterectomy (n=7), and URS (n=3). All patients who underwent URS were confirmed to have UTUC through biopsy. Among UTUC patients, Bladder CARE test resulted positive in 47, high-risk in 1, and negative in 2 patients. Comparing Bladder CARE test results with tumor pathologic features demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between BCI values and tumor size (p = 0.009). UTUC patients had significantly higher BCI values compared to the controls (mean BCI 189.3 vs. 1.6, respectively; p &#60; 0.0001). ROC curve showed an AUC of 0.9662 (95% CI = 0.9296-1). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of Bladder CARE to detect UTUC were 96%, 88%, 88.9%, and 95.7%, respectively. In comparison, the sensitivity of urine cytology in our cohort was 37%.<br \/>Conclusions: In this prospective pilot study, the proposed urine-based epigenetic test (Bladder CARE) showed high sensitivity and negative predictive value in the diagnosis of patients with UTUC. In addition, the sensitivity of this test was exceedingly higher than the standard urine cytology. A larger sample size study to validate the accuracy of this test is the next step.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genitourinary cancers: bladder,Liquid biopsies,Epigenetics,DNA methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Paolo Piatti<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Alireza Ghoreifi<sup>2<\/sup>, Sanam Seyedian<sup>2<\/sup>, Yap Ching Chew<sup>3<\/sup>, Benjamin Jara<sup>1<\/sup>, Lucy Sanossian<sup>3<\/sup>, Jeffrey Bhasin<sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Basin<sup>2<\/sup>, Taikun Yamada<sup>3<\/sup>, Gerhard Fuchs<sup>2<\/sup>, Sumeet Bhanvadia<sup>2<\/sup>, Rene Sotelo<sup>2<\/sup>, Andrew Hung<sup>2<\/sup>, Monish Aron<sup>2<\/sup>, Mihir Desai<sup>2<\/sup>, Inderbir Gill<sup>2<\/sup>, Siamak Daneshmand<sup>2<\/sup>, Gangning Liang<sup>4<\/sup>, Hooman Djaladat<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Zymo Research Corp., Irvine, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Urology, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA,<sup>3<\/sup>Pangea Laboratory, LLC, Tustin, CA,<sup>4<\/sup>Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0d0f3e5f-4763-4382-bf7d-61f177ce9fc2","ControlNumber":"3973","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;P.

Tumor derived EVs give insight into a tumor&#8217;s mutational burden and provide both prognostic and diagnostic value as a liquid biopsy tool. Melanoma is an aggressive cancer with a lack of promising markers for early detection, onset of metastasis, and monitoring of recurrence. The ExoNeedle chip is intended to pierce through the epidermis and parts of the dermis to isolate melanoma secreted EVs from the ISF to alleviate these unmet needs.<br \/>The microneedle arrays were created through the Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) process and a subsequent wet etching step to sharpen the needles. A 4 inch silicon wafer spin coated with 3 microns of positive photoresist was lithographically patterned and etched by DRIE using the standard Bosch processes to expose arrays of cylindrical pillars. Next, the cylindrical features were sharpened using an isotropic wet etch consisting of a mixture of hydrofluoric and nitric acid. The microneedle arrays were made and cleaved into individual patches. Meanwhile, hybrid hydrogel solution was made from Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and alginate by dissolving each of them separately in water under heat, followed by mixing the solutions. After centrifuging and filtering the hydrogel, it was conjugated with Annexin V (Av) protein to give it affinity for cancerous exosomes. Lastly, this hydrogel complex was added onto the microneedle patches and gelated with the help of a humidifier that deposited Ca2+ ion vapor over the hydrogel.<br \/>The microneedles were first optimized and validated using melanoma cell line secreted EVs. Melanoma EVs were successfully isolated and quantified to evaluate the efficacy of the microneedle patches yielding above an 80% capture efficiency from purified serum samples. The microneedle patches were DiO stained, fluorescently imaged, visualized in a scanning electron microscope, and protein concentration was determined respectfully. Additionally, the functional hydrogel coatings on the microneedles are dissolved in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), subsequently unbinding EVs from Av due to EDTA-based Ca2+ chelation. The dissolved solution is then used for enumeration and quantification of EVs by nanoparticle tracking analysis. We are further validating these patches in skin mimicking models and patient derived xenograft models of melanoma.<br \/>The technology developed in this study for the isolation of melanoma EVs can broadly pave the way for minimally invasive point of care cancer diagnostics and tracking for melanoma patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Extracellular vesicles,Technology,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Scott  M.

The FDA approved sotorasib, a KRAS G12C inhibitor, for targeted treatment of patients with KRAS G12C-mutated locally or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is essential to detect the KRAS G12C mutation with a companion diagnostic before the drug is administered. We have developed two KRAS G12C mutation detection assays for qPCR or Sanger sequencing. Both QClamp<sup>&#174;<\/sup> assays use our proprietary xeno nucleic acid (XNA) technology which specifically enhances the amplification of the target mutant DNA sequence while blocking amplification of the wildtype sequence, thus significantly improving the sensitivity of the assays for qPCR (~1%) and Sanger sequencing (~15 to 20%) to 0.1% variant allele frequency. These simple and sensitive assays can be used for clinical research or validated in CLIA labs for KRAS G12C mutation detection for the purpose of companion diagnostic use. Although NGS methods are gaining traction in clinical settings, our methods are suitable for standard molecular diagnostics laboratory settings and do not add any additional steps to the qPCR or Sanger sequencing protocols. Our methods are especially valuable for labs that appreciate simple, economical, yet sensitive companion diagnostics assays for KRAS G12C mutation.<b> <\/b>QClamp<sup>&#174;<\/sup> assays can be easily adapted to detect other single gene mutations with high sensitivity for companion diagnostics use or other mutation detection applications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Diagnostic marker,Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR),Sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Robert William Brown<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Wei Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Qing Sun<sup>2<\/sup>, Hui Ren<sup>2<\/sup>, Jonathan Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Larry Pastor<sup>2<\/sup>, Daniel Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Michael Sha<sup>2<\/sup>, Aiguo Zhang<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Marketing, DiaCarta, Inc., Pleasanton, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>R&D, DiaCarta, Inc., Pleasanton, CA,<sup>3<\/sup>CEO, DiaCarta, Inc., Pleasanton, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4e20b8cd-41ac-4581-979c-7af7273668a9","ControlNumber":"6930","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.

However, the sensitivity of bronchoscopy is low. In addition, bronchial washing cytology, a routine auxiliary test, does not significantly improve the performance of bronchoscopy due to its low sensitivity. To improve the diagnostic performance of bronchoscopy, protocadherin GA12 (PCDHGA12) and Cysteine &#8203;&#8203;Dioxygenase Type 1 (CDO1) methylation biomarkers in bronchial washing fluid have been introduced as novel adjunctive diagnostic tests.<br \/>Methods: A total of 161 patients with suspected lung cancer who underwent bronchoscopy were analyzed. Cytological examination of bronchial washing fluid and testing for PCDHGA12 and CDO1 methylation biomarkers were performed.<br \/>Results: The final diagnosis was lung cancer in 114 patients, and benign disease in 49 patients. PCDHGA12 methylation biomarker showed sensitivity of 80.4% and specificity of 87.8%. CDO1 methylation biomarker showed sensitivity of 66.1% and specificity of 98.0%, whereas cytological evaluation showed sensitivity of 43.8% and specificity of 100%. The combined analysis of PCDHGA12 and CDO1 methylation showed sensitivity of 84.8% and specificity of 85.7%. The combined analysis of the methylation biomarkers and cytology tests resulted in a slightly increased sensitivity of 86.6% and specificity of 85.7%. The specificity and sensitivity of the methylation biomarkers were also high in peripheral lung cancer.<br \/>Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrated that PCDHGA12 and CDO1 methylation as lung cancer biomarkers of bronchial washing may be used as adjunctive tests for bronchoscopy.

BTN1A1 exhibits a mutually exclusive expression pattern to that of PD-1\/PD-L1, making anti-BTN1A1 antibody therapy an attractive option for cancer patients with PD-L1 refractory or relapsed disease. While current cancer immunotherapies have shown some efficacy against late-stage disease, there remains a major unmet medical need as a large number of patients fail to respond to current treatments. BTN1A1 has been studied at length in preclinical models to characterize its immunomodulatory functions, revealing its ability to inhibit the proliferation of activated T cells and the ability of these cells to kill tumor cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. <i>In vivo,<\/i> BTN1A1-overexpressing tumor models exhibit accelerated growth, whereas the growth of BTN1A1-deficient tumors is impaired in immunocompetent settings, supporting a role for this protein in the regulation of immune evasion. Here in, we present the development of a diagnostic antibody for use in the anti-BTN1A1 therapy clinical trials to enable the immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of human BTN1A1. A high-quality BTN1A1 antibody may help predict which patients are more likely to respond to BTN1A1 antibody-based cancer therapy, similar to the PD-L1 companion diagnostic test for anti-PD-L1\/PD-1 therapy. The characterization of the developed BTN1A1 antibody was conducted via ELISA, Western blotting, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry to demonstrate its overall performance. Validation was performed using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human tumor tissue samples to determine the analytical sensitivity and specificity of the IHC assay. This antibody was also found to be of value for imaging mass cytometry and flow cytometry experiments elucidating applicable clinical features of both human tumor tissues and immune cells. Specifically, the developed antibody can detect the robust expression of BTN1A1 on both cancer cells and immune cells, while also revealing the mutually exclusive expression of BTN1A1 and PD-L1. Finally, we demonstrate the capability of a BTN1A1 antibody that can be used to identify BTN1A1-positive patients with a high degree of analytical sensitivity and specificity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Biomarkers,Immune response,Immune checkpoint,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Stephen  S.

Vague symptoms and high prevalence of metastasis and recurrence present serious obstacles to its clinical management. Current diagnostic and monitoring modalities for EWS, including tissue biopsy, imaging, and cytogenetics have limitations in the early diagnosis and disease monitoring. Thus, EWS patients, as do other solid pediatric cancers, face unique challenges in the lack of non-invasive tests to aid with patient management. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, are emerging as a new paradigm of liquid biopsy for non-invasive cancer diagnosis and monitoring owing to their informative cargoes and imperative biological functions. However, limited progresses have been reported in the field of EWS-related EV diagnostics. To address this gap, we developed a new microfluidics-based digital immunoassay platform, termed &#956;TUNER (microfluidic Topographic modUlation and iNtensification of Enzymatic Reaction), for ultrasensitive single-molecular analysis of EV protein biomarkers and liquid biopsy-based diagnosis of EWS. Through constructing nanoconfinements with tunable sizes, this technology affords programmable patterning and modulation of surface enzymatic reactions in a non-contact manner. Such unique capacity enables us to develop a compartment-free digital immunoassay platform which is conceptually distinct from the existing digital assays. As a proof-of-concept for clinical applications, we adapted the &#956;TUNER digital immunoassay platform to quantitatively evaluate four exo-protein biomarkers (CD99, ENO-2, NGFR, and Ezrin) that we identified by extensive proteomics analysis of EWS cell line-derived EVs (PMID: 32821345). Using protein standards and EWS cell line-derived EVs, we demonstrated that our technology affords sensitive and quantitative detection of exo-protein biomarkers with LODs at the fg\/mL level, which warrants subsequent assessment of its adaptability to clinical EWS diagnosis. EV profiling of plasma samples from adult and pediatric EWS patients (n = 16) and matched healthy controls (n = 17) reveals unique expression patterns of the four markers. These exo-protein biomarkers individually afforded excellent diagnostic performance (AUC, CD99: 0.992; ENO-2: 0.985; NGFR: 0.996; Ezrin: 0.978) to differentiate the EWS and control groups. The unweighted SUM signature of the four proteins further improves the diagnostic power to yield an AUC of 1.00. Meanwhile, the distinctive EV signature obtained from the machine learning-based analysis permits further classification of control, adult, and pediatric patients with an overall accuracy of 97%. Based on these results, we envision that our technology combined with the novel exo-protein biomarker signature can be useful clinically to improve the diagnosis of patients with Ewing sarcoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Diagnostic marker,Extracellular vesicles,Digital assay,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yunjie Wen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Vikalp Vishwakarma<sup>2<\/sup>, Andrew  K.

Because mesothelin is overexpressed in a variety of human cancer types including ovarian cancers, it represents an attractive target for novel therapies employing adaptive T-cell transfer in these tumors. However, tumor heterogeneity is a challenge for targeted therapies.<br \/>Methods: To study the extent of heterogeneity of mesothelin overexpression in primary ovarian cancers and their peritoneal and lymph node metastases, a tissue microarray (TMA) was constructed from multiple sites of 220 ovarian cancers and analyzed by immunohistochemistry. One tissue core each was taken from up to 18 different tumor blocks per cancer, resulting in a total of 2,460 tissue spots from 423 tumor sites (188 primary cancers, 162 peritoneal carcinosis and 73 lymph node metastases).<br \/>Results: Positive mesothelin expression was found in 2,041 of the 2,342 (87%) arrayed tissue spots and in 372 of the 392 (95%) tumor sites that were interpretable for mesothelin immunohistochemistry. Intratumoral heterogeneity was found in 23% of 168 primary cancer sites interpretable for mesothelin and decreased to 12% in 154 peritoneal carcinosis and to 6% in 71 lymph node metastases (p&#60;0.0001). Heterogeneity between the primary tumor and matched peritoneal carcinosis was found in 16% of 102 cancers with interpretable mesothelin results. In these cancers, the mesothelin status switched from positive in the primary tumor to negative in the peritoneal carcinosis (3 cancers) in or vice versa (2 cancers), or a mixture of positive and negative peritoneal carcinoses was found (11 cancers). No such switch was seen between the mesothelin-interpretable primary tumors and their nodal metastases of 59 cancers, and only one mesothelin-positive tumor had a mixture of positive and negative lymph node metastases.<br \/>Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that mesothelin expression is frequent and highly homogeneous in ovarian cancer and prompt for future anti-mesothelin therapy studies in this tumor type.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunohistochemistry,Mesothelin ,ovarian cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Sören Weidemann<sup>1<\/sup>, Natalia Gorbokon<sup>1<\/sup>, Maximilian Lennartz<sup>1<\/sup>, Claudia Hube-Magg<sup>1<\/sup>, Christoph Fraune<sup>1<\/sup>, Christian Bernreuther<sup>1<\/sup>, Till Clauditz<sup>1<\/sup>, Frank Jacobsen<sup>1<\/sup>, Kristina Jansen<sup>1<\/sup>, Barbara Schmalfeldt<sup>1<\/sup>, Linn Wölber<sup>1<\/sup>, Peter Paluchowski<sup>2<\/sup>, Enikö Berkes<sup>3<\/sup>, Uwe Heilenkötter<sup>4<\/sup>, Guido Sauter<sup>1<\/sup>, Ria Uhlig<sup>1<\/sup>, Waldemar Wilczak<sup>1<\/sup>, Stefan Steurer<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Ronald Simon<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Till Krech<sup>1<\/sup>, Andreas Marx<sup>5<\/sup>, Eike Burandt<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany,<sup>2<\/sup>Regio Clinic Pinneberg, Pinneberg, Germany,<sup>3<\/sup>Albertinen Clinic, Hamburg, Germany,<sup>4<\/sup>Regio Clinic Itzehohe, Itzehohe, Germany,<sup>5<\/sup>Academic Hospital Fuerth, Fuerth, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"84715dd0-ad0a-4cf5-9442-04f61c4e9850","ControlNumber":"6106","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Using this approach, the interrogation of disease progression is facilitated through analysis of millions of V(D)J combinations from B cell receptors (BCRs) and T cell receptors (TCRs). One major challenge of immune repertoire sequencing is to accurately capture the structural and sequence complexities of antibodies and TCR genes during both library preparation and bioinformatic analysis. In addition, the lack of standard reference controls makes assessing sequencing accuracy and sensitivity challenging. Here, we present a method for accurate sequencing of full-length immune gene repertoires of B cells and T cells.<br \/>RNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or tissues were used for reverse transcription, during which unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) were added to discretely barcode each mRNA molecule. BCR- and TCR-specific PCR primers were used to enrich full-length BCR and TCR sequences. We have implemented a data analysis pipeline to assemble the full length BCR\/TCR transcripts and to collapse PCR copies of each mRNA fragment into a single consensus sequence using UMIs. UMI incorporation enables the absolute quantification of input RNA molecules and accurate ranking of antibody\/TCR clone abundance. Furthermore, we developed an RNA control pool that contains a large dynamic range of BCR and TCR sequences with a variety of V(D)J combinations, which enables sensitivity and accuracy evaluation of BCR and TCR sequencing.<br \/>Our immune repertoire sequencing approach allows accurate clonal determination for both BCR and TCR. This technique is applicable for various applications including design of antibody chains for <i>in vitro<\/i> synthesis, investigation of T cell infiltration of tumor microenvironments, and monitoring of minimal residual disease in cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Immuno-oncology,Immune cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chen Song<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Ariel Erijman<sup><\/sup>, Sean Lund<sup><\/sup>, Bradley  W.

Recently, circRNAs are identified in many types of cancers, and its function has been elucidated as multiple miRNAs sponge. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of malignancies. The incidence and mortality of HCC have been on the rise in recent years. Thus, it is necessary to identify further molecular mechanisms of HCC initiation and progression. In this study, we aim to investigate the clinical relevance of circRNAs encoded by the ZKSCAN1 (Zinc finger protein with KRAB and SCAN domains 1) gene in HCC.We analyzed clinical specimens from 100 pairs of HCC and corresponding normal liver (NL) tissues. Total RNAs were isolated from clinical tissues using qiagen kit. CircRNAs (circZKSCAN1) derived from ZKSCAN1 gene. The expression levels were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and its expression was normalized with GAPDH. In addition, we analyzed the correlation between circZKSCAN1 expression and various clinicopathological features of HCC patients.CircZKSCAN1 expression was significantly down-regulated in HCC tissues compared to corresponding NL tissues (P&#60;0.001). In HCC patients, circZKSCAN1 expression was gradually suppressed according to state of malignant progression (P&#60;0.010). Further correlation analysis showed that circZKSCAN1 expression was significantly associated with T-stage (P=0.009), TNM stage (P=0.002), BCLC stage (P=0.0467), and survival (P&#60;0.001).Conclusively, we have determined clinical significances of circZKSCAN1 expression in HCC, which may provide clinical evidence for the potential of circZKSCAN1 as novel markers for diagnosis and predicting prognosis in HCC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Noncoding RNA,Biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Minji Bang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Gyeonghwa Kim<sup><\/sup>, Eun Hwangbo<sup><\/sup>, Mi Yeon Jeon<sup><\/sup>, Keun Hur<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e6527a91-158a-418c-abeb-050f0f6cdb6e","ControlNumber":"7944","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

The origins of EVs, their formation, and potential clinical use as biomarkers are not well understood. Recently, budding of extracellular structures on Cancer Associated Macrophage-Like Cells [CAMLs] a specific subtype of phagocytic circulating stromal cells has been observed in metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma (mNSCLC) patients. In this prospective analysis of n=40 mNSCLC samples, we enumerated EV budding on CAMLs to determine if their formation had an effect on clinical outcomes. These preliminary results suggest that EV budding from a specific subtype of circulating tumor associated macrophage prognosticates for worse clinical outcome which may serve as the mechanism for cancer EV formation and spread throughout the body.<br \/><b>Patients and Methods:<\/b> We initiated a single blind prospective pilot study to evaluate extracellular budding on the CAMLs of mNSCLC patients from blood samples obtained prior to therapy to determine their prevalence and clinical utility. Anonymized blood was procured and filtered to isolate CAMLs and stained for cytokeratin, CD45, CD31 and PD-L1. EV budding was observed as small (&#8804;1 &#181;m) bulbous protrusions from the cell periphery. EVs were quantified and compared against patient progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with hazard ratios (HRs) at 24 months by censored univariate analysis.

With a minimum of 24 months of follow-up, it was determined that the presence of EV budding in patients&#8217; CAMLs was associated with significantly worse PFS (HR=4.00, 95%CI=1.4-12, p=0.0251) and borderline significant OS (HR=3.57, 95%CI=1.1-12, p=0.0747).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>EV budding found on phagocytic stromal cells found in the blood appear with tumor positive biomarkers and predict poor survival.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) carries the worst prognosis among all the breast cancer intrinsic subtypes and has limited treatment options. Currently, TNBC subtypes are mainly refined into four categories: basal-like (BL1 and BL2), luminal androgen receptor (LAR) and mesenchymal (M). Although each of these tumor-specific subtypes represent different gene expression profiles, response to standard treatments and prognosis, further studies did not confirm a prognostic value for these subtypes. Given the distinct outcomes of TNBC patients, there is an urgent need to stratify their prognosis and identify patients who may benefit from potential targeted therapy. TNBC tumors often harbor cancer cells with different features in both genomic and transcriptomic level. With deconvolution of existing genomic and transcriptomic data, we derived a mathematical definition of breast cancer cell plasticity at a patient level. With a total of 765 TNBC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC), Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC) and Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network-Breast project (SCAN-B), we measured tumor-cell total mRNA expression scores (TmS) through an integrative deconvolution method with matched DNAseq and RNAseq data. In our previous study (Cao et al. Nature Biotechnology 2022), high TmS value is significantly associated with favorable prognosis in both TCGA (n=108) and METABRIC (n=214). We now validated this finding in both FUSCC from Han Chinese (n=245) and SCAN-B from Swedes (n=198). With TmS as a patient-level phenotypic feature, we performed differential expression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis to understand the biological functions indicated by TmS. In all four TNBC cohorts, patients with lower TmS are associated with epithelial to mesenchymal and TGF&#946; signaling hallmark pathways, with the latter presenting potential molecular targets for TNBC. Gene ontology enrichment revealed patients with higher TmS overexpress genes that are related with immune activities such as B cell and lymphocyte activation. Our results suggest a unique utility of tumor-specific total mRNA level in identifying high-risk TNBC patients across multi-ethnic cohorts and tailoring treatment on individual basis to maximize clinical benefit.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Tumor heterogeneity,Prognostic markers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yaoyi Dai<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Shaolong Cao<sup>2<\/sup>, Bora Lim<sup>1<\/sup>, Johan Staaf<sup>3<\/sup>, Gloria  V.

A Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified, 14-gene, quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based expression assay was found to better stratify mortality risk. The association of molecular risk stratification with other clinicopathological, radiomic, and genetic risk factors have not been fully identified, especially in Chinese NSCLC patients (pts).<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: We newly recruited 102 early-stage non-squamous NSCLC pts who had undergone complete surgical resection. RNA was extracted from tumor tissue specimens and prospective molecular risk stratification by the 14-gene prognostic assay was performed. Gene mutation status and tumor mutational burden (TMB) were evaluated. Histological sections and clinical records were reviewed for canonical prognostic indicators that have been reported to be associated with lung cancer risk.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Of the 102 pts, the mean age was 55 years, 66 (64.7%) were female, and 18 (17.7%) had a smoking history. The majority of pts (84, 82.4%) were stage I, with 1 atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), 6 adenocarcinomas in situ (AIS), 1 stage II, and 2 stage III. 64 pts were deemed low-risk by molecular testing, 24 were intermediate-risk, and 14 were high-risk. The pts of AAH and AIS were all in the low-risk group. The maximum tumor diameter (MTD) in the high-risk group was the highest. There were no significant differences in age, sex, smoking status, pathologic stage, NCCN risk criteria, micropapillary or solid (MP\/S) pattern, or the number of lesions between the three groups. The most common driver mutations were <i>EGFR<\/i> (65%), <i>TP53<\/i> (28%), and <i>RBM10<\/i> (13%). The molecular risk stratification had a significant association with <i>TP53<\/i> (p = 0.013), <i>TP53<\/i> loss of function (LOF, p = 0.01), <i>KRAS<\/i> (p = 0.011), and <i>APC<\/i> mutation (p = 0.05), but not with <i>EGFR<\/i> mutation and co-mutational status. TMB in the low-risk pts was significantly lower than in other pts (p = 0.007). The low-risk pts had lower SUV<sub>max<\/sub> (p = 0.076), significantly lower mean CT value (p = 0.023), and mean enhanced CT value (p = 0.005) compared with others. In the NCCN low-risk pts, 25 were molecular low-risk, 12 were intermediate-risk, and 9 were high-risk. The risk stratification showed a significant association with SUV<sub>max, <\/sub><i>TP53<\/i> mutation, and TMB in the NCCN low-risk pts. Pearson correlation showed the molecular risk score was significantly associated with MTD, TMB, SUV<sub>max<\/sub>, mean CT value, mean enhanced CT value, and max CT value. SUV<sub>max <\/sub>showed the strongest correlation with the risk score.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The molecular risk stratification by the 14-gene assay was associated with canonical prognostic indicators, like <i>TP53<\/i> LOF, <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>KRAS<\/i>, <i>APC<\/i> mutation, TMB, mean CT value, and mean enhanced CT value.

Early detection is common, but is followed by the more challenging task of prognosing a highly variable clinical course. Current clinical risk-assessment strategies such as serum abundance of prostate specific antigen (PSA), tumor size &#38; extent, and tumor grade based on biopsy are highly imprecise: over a third of patients are over-treated. An improved method of risk stratification may lie in hereditary factors. Prostate cancer is one of the most strongly inherited (h2 = 57%), with accumulating evidence associating rare variants, common variants, and genetic ancestry to clinical outcomes. We have performed germline sequencing on blood from thousands of patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer and with extensive follow-up data. We quantify the interactions of rare and common variants, and demonstrate that germline features provide insights into patient outcomes and optimal management strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Germline Genomics,Targeted Sequencing,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nicole Zeltser<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kathleen  E.

This cancer is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage and can recur frequently and quickly with low chances of survival. Moreover, LUAD patients live with the fear of developing second primary tumors in their lifetime.<b> <\/b>A high-resolution SNP array (Affymetrix 250 NspI) analysis of primary LUAD tumors and their follow-up mucosal biopsies identified frequent copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH, loss of 59 SNPs) of <i>CACNA1C<\/i>, a calcium voltage-gated channel subunit, located to human chromosome 12p13.33. Transcriptomic profiling utilizing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed frequent loss of mRNA expression of <i>CACNA1C<\/i> in LUAD tumors (n=515) compared to the normal counterparts (n=59). Loss of <i>CACNA1C<\/i> mRNA expression was significantly associated with stage, grade, lymph node metastasis, <i>P53<\/i> gene mutation, and worst survival of the LUAD patients. Epigenetic alteration such as DNA methylation could be a potential mechanism of the inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene (TSG) other than LOH, frequently observed in human cancers. We also recorded significantly higher promoter methylation of <i>CACNA1C<\/i> in the above LUAD tumors compared to the normal counterparts. Higher promoter methylation of <i>CACNA1C<\/i> was significantly associated with stage, grade, lymph node metastasis, <i>P53<\/i> gene mutation, and poor survival of the LUAD patients. Thus, both allelic loss and methylation appear to be potential mechanisms behind the loss of function of<i> CACNA1C<\/i> in LUAD patients. Further validation of <i>CACNA1C<\/i> expression at the protein level confirmed its high membranous expression in normal lung tissues. Analysis of an independent cohort of LUAD subjects revealed significant loss of <i>CACNA1C<\/i> in primary tumors (n=30) and lymph node metastases (n=10) of LUAD patients compared to their normal counterparts. Loss of <i>CACNA1C<\/i> protein expression was associated with lymph node metastasis and stage-wise progression of the LUAD patients. Further validation of <i>CACNA1C<\/i> expression in larger cohorts and functional characterization would be beneficial for potential biomarkers and therapeutic development in the longer run. On the other hand, epigenetically silenced TSGs can be reactivated by CRISPR-CAS9-based technology or demethylating agents, implicating the therapeutic promise of targeting TSGs. <b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Tumor suppressor gene,Biomarkers,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Saanvi Dasgupta<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Srijan Acharya<sup>2<\/sup>, Mohammad  A.

We aim to show the feasibility of an Exogenous Volatile Organic Compounds (EVOC<sup>&#174;<\/sup>) Probe targeting tumor-associated extracellular &#946;-glucuronidase, a glycosidase enzyme that usually resides intracellularly within lysosomes in healthy tissues.<br \/>Material and Methods: To further assess the suitability of &#946;-glucuronidase as a target for a non-invasive breath test, the enzyme activity was evaluated by enzymatic assay in lung cancer PDX specimens and healthy tissues. In addition, &#946;-glucuronidase was assessed by immunostaining a large panel of primary lung cancers, lymph node metastasis and normal lung tissue, including from smokers and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We developed a hydrophilic non-cell permeable substrate probe, D5-ethyl-&#946;D-glucuronide (D5-EtGlu), that upon hydrolysis by the target enzyme releases D5-ethanol, a unique volatile reporter molecule. This provides a readout of tumour-associated enzyme activity using breath analysis. Administering D5-EtGlu to mice resulted in tumour-specific release of D5-Ethanol enabling discrimination between healthy and tumour-bearing animals. D5-EtGlu has been administered intravenously to healthy and lung cancer patients followed by breath analysis. A phase 1a clinical trial administered D5-EtGlu to 21 healthy individuals in a single ascending dose study to establish safety and background D5-ethanol levels in healthy individuals. The phase 1b trial is a proof of mechanism study in humans, in which D5-ethanol breath levels in lung cancer patients will be compared to cancer-free individuals receiving the same D5-EtGlu dose.<br \/>Results and Discussions: Using ex-vivo specimens, higher &#946;-glucuronidase activity was detected in washouts of PDX specimens compared with healthy tissue samples from mice. Higher &#946;-glucuronidase intracellular and extracellular expression was observed in lung cancers compared with lung normal tissue, with low to moderate expression intracellularly in bronchial tissue and in emphysema and COPD. These results reinforce the presence of &#946;-glucuronidase in the tumour microenvironment and its suitability as a target for a breath-probe. A phase 1a resulted in no adverse events and low\/no D5-ethanol signal verifying the inaccessibility of D5-EtGlu to intracellular &#946;-glucuronidase. In the phase 1b study, using the highest probe dose, we have detected a D5-ethanol signal in the majority of the cancer patients.<br \/>Conclusion: &#946;-glucuronidase can be targeted by the non-cell permeable substrate probe D5-ethyl-&#946;D-glucuronide (D5-EtGlu) with potential to be used as a non-invasive breath test for lung cancer diagnosis including a role in screening.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Early detection,Lung cancer,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Christiaan Labuschagne<sup>1<\/sup>, Rob Smith<sup>1<\/sup>, Neelam Kumar<sup>2<\/sup>, Max Allsworth<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Billy Boyle<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sam Janes<sup>2<\/sup>, Philip Crosbie<sup>3<\/sup>, Robert Rintoul<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Owlstone Medical, Cambridge, United Kingdom,<sup>2<\/sup>UCL Division of Medicine, The Lungs for Living Institute, London, United Kingdom,<sup>3<\/sup>University Hospital of South Manchester, North West Lung Centre, Manchester, United Kingdom,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Oncology, University of Cambridge\/Royal Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, United Kingdom","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"dddb4d4e-b7ad-4b7e-9cfe-8fe647516f0b","ControlNumber":"1385","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

For a small proportion (10-20%) of early-stage patients however, surgical resection of the pancreatic tumor offers the best chance for survival (5-year rate of 20%). Given the clinical challenges and the need for personalized care strategies to maximize patient survival, we propose the utility of the minimally invasive liquid biopsy to identify circulating biomarkers in patient blood to guide prognosis and monitor treatment. This study used the non-enriching third generation High-Definition Single Cell Assay (HDSCA3.0) workflow to investigate the clinical significance of a heterogeneous circulating rare cell population in both the peripheral and portal vein blood of early-stage PDAC patients (n = 20) at four different time points&#8212;pre-, during, and post- surgical resection, as well as at one-week follow-up. Compared to normal donor samples (n = 50), PDAC patients had a significantly greater incidence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs: cytokeratin-positive (CK+) and CD35\/45-negative). There was no significant difference in rare cell incidence between peripheral and portal vein samples. However, specific phenotypes of rare cells were observed at different frequencies based on time of sample collection. Patient samples collected pre-surgery had a significantly higher incidence of CTCs than samples collected during surgery, while post-surgery samples had a significantly higher incidence of total CK+ rare cells and mesenchymal CTCs (Vimentin-positive, CK+) than during-surgery samples. While post-surgical samples also had a higher total CK+ rare cell and CTC incidence than pre-surgical samples, the difference was not statistically significant. Additionally, patients who received neoadjuvant therapy with surgical resection had lower average incidence of rare cells. Overall, the data presented here reveal that 1) liquid biopsy analytes are detected at a higher incidence in localized PDAC than normal donors; 2) the time point of sample collection in relation to surgery leads to a statistically significant different in frequency of detectable analytes; and 3) anatomical location of blood draw is not associated with difference in rare cell incidence. This study demonstrates the liquid biopsy&#8217;s utility in early-stage PDAC detection at the time of surgical resection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-03 Early detection biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Cancer detection,Circulating tumor cells,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Emmeline  Y.

However, collecting pathological tissue is highly invasive, and lower invasive test is needed. As an alternative diagnostic target, circulating cancer cells (CTCs) that are known to exist in the peripheral blood of cancer patients are garnering attention. <b>PURPOSE<\/b>: The goal of this study is to verify the utility of CTC analysis isolated by a novel system (Sysmex, Hyogo) against pathological testing of tumor samples. The primary objective is to determine whether CTCs can be detected in unresectable NSCLC patients, and the secondary objective is to evaluate the relationship between CTCs and clinicopathological features or clinical outcome. <b>METHODS<\/b>: Blood samples were collected from 45 patients with unresectable NSCLC and 17 healthy controls. CTCs were size-dependently enriched from whole blood, immunofluorescent stained with pan-CK (AE1\/AE3), PD-L1, CD45\/34\/16, and Hoechst, and analyzed by Molecular Imaging Flow Cytometry (MI-1000). Fluorescence intensity and cell images of each marker were obtained by MI-1000. <b>RESULTS<\/b>: Cells positive for Hoechst but negative for blood cell markers were defined as non-blood cells (NBCs). Pan-CK positive NBCs were defined as CTCs. A similar number of NBCs were detected in both patients and healthy controls. When using a threshold set at two standard deviations above the mean fluorescence intensity of pan-CK and PD-LI of NBCs in healthy controls, 28.9% of patients had two or more CTCs. On the other hands, PD-L1 positive NBCs were only detected in patients, and the sensitivity of detecting CTCs or PD-L1 positive NBCs was 86.7%. Concordance with PD-L1 expression of tumor tissue was evaluated for three parameters: the number of PD-L1 positive NBCs, the median and the mean fluorescence intensities. The AUC in each case was low, indicating no concordance between PD-L1 expression of tumor tissue and CTCs. Additionally, no relation was found with the overall survivals and progression-free survival when comparing patients divided into two groups: those with two or more PD-L1 positive cells and those with less than two. <b>CONCLUSION<\/b>: The detected rate of pan-CK positive cells was low (&#60;30%), but increased to 86.7% when pan-CK negative and PD-L1 positive NBCs, which are not found in healthy controls, were included. However, further studies are needed to evaluate whether these NBCs are CTCs. In addition, there was no association between PD-L1 positive NBCs and PD-L1 expression of tumor tissue or clinical outcome in this study. Recently, we have verified that the detected ratio of CTCs could be improved by adding a CK8\/18 marker and hence, plan to verify the clinical usefulness of detecting CTCs using CK8\/18.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Liquid biopsies,Lung cancer: non-small cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mami Onishi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Eri Morita<sup>1<\/sup>, Tetsuya Sakai<sup>2<\/sup>, Yoshitaka Zenke<sup>2<\/sup>, Masatoshi Yanagida<sup>1<\/sup>, Koichi Goto<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Thoracic Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital East, Tokyo, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"026992ec-26b0-403c-ada4-2b038b21edd6","ControlNumber":"993","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

However, progress in pediatric cancers is limited due to a) limited amounts of cfDNA b) differences in the cancer driver landscape - higher prevalence of copy number alterations (CNA) and fusions with few point mutations and c) small sample sizes.<br \/>Here, we addressed some of these challenges by performing low-pass whole genome (LPWGS) and\/or targeted sequencing (TS) of cfDNA on a cohort of 125 pediatric solid (n=78) and brain (n=47) tumor patients enrolled either at diagnosis, after therapy or relapse. Plasma was collected from patients with sarcoma, renal, hepatic and germ-cell tumors; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during surgery from children with low and high grade gliomas, ependymomas, craniopharyngiomas and embryonal tumors; and aqueous humor for retinoblastoma. WGS libraries were constructed with the xGen Prism DNA Library Kit using 5ng of input cfDNA and sequenced (Illumina NextSeq 500) to a mean coverage of 4.1x. CNAs were evaluated using ichorCNA and compared with clinical microarray results from primary tumors. Selected cases with previously clinically reported <i>BRAF, EWSR1<\/i> and <i>FOXO1<\/i> canonical gene fusions and driver mutations from our OncoKids assay were analyzed using TS (Twist Bioscience) sequenced to a mean coverage of 582x.<br \/>In treatment naive cases that had an aberration detected in the primary tumor, we observed an overall positivity rate in 67% (72\/107) of cases using cfDNA. For a subset of 45 cases with at least 10% circulating-tumor (ct) DNA, we compared LPWGS results with microarray data from the primary tumor and identified 88\/92 (96%) of the clinically reported events suggesting its utility as a diagnostic tool. In adult cancers, proportion of short (&#60;150bp) to long fragments (S\/L ratio) using LPWGS was shown to correlate with ctDNA concentration and consequently detectability. Therefore, we categorized tumor types as low-burden if the median S\/L ratio was below the median value across all tumor types and as high-burden otherwise. Interestingly, ctDNA detectability rates were significantly higher in high-burden tumors (27\/52 vs 28\/37, Fisher&#8217;s exact P-value = 0.03) suggesting that S\/L ratios could define ctDNA detectability. Though anecdotal in evidence, LPWGS demonstrated CNAs distinctly present in primary and metastatic lesions and in at least one case, revealed ctDNA in plasma, 9 months prior to relapse. These findings suggest cfDNA may be more representative of tumor clonal composition and utilized for MRD detection.<br \/>These findings affirm the clinical utility of liquid biopsy assays to diagnose and monitor a variety of pediatric solid and brain tumors. Clinical trials and larger cohorts are necessary for ctDNA guided risk and therapeutic stratification of pediatric cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Pediatric cancers,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Venkata Yellapantula<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Eirini Christodoulou<sup>1<\/sup>, Katrina O’Hollaran<sup>2<\/sup>, Jianling Ji<sup>1<\/sup>, Liya Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Jesse  L.
