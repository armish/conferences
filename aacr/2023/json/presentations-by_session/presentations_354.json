[{"Abstract":"The LAR subtype of TNBC is enriched for targetable biomarkers, including androgen receptor (AR) expression, <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutations, and intact Rb. The purpose of this study was to investigate the most effective combinations of inhibitors of CDK4\/6 (palbociclib), AR (enzalutamide), and PI3K-AKT (alpelisib\/capivasertib) against preclinical models of LAR TNBC. MDA-MB-453 and MFM-223 (both AR positive\/Rb-intact\/<i>PIK3CA<\/i>-mutant) LAR TNBC cells were treated with each inhibitor alone or in different combinations. Drug sensitivity was measured as growth in 2D, colony formation, and CellTiterGlo viability. Synergistic drug effects were expressed as the combination index (CI) calculated by CompuSyn methods. Activation of cell cycle and PI3K-AKT signaling molecules in response to different inhibitors or siRNAs was measured by immunoblot analysis. An androgen response element (ARE) luciferase reporter assay was used to evaluate AR transcriptional activity. MDA-MB-453 and MFM-223 cells were sensitive to single-agent palbociclib, alpelisib, or capivasertib (IC<sub>50<\/sub> ~500 nM) but not enzalutamide (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 15-25 &#181;M). Palbociclib combined with either the PI3K&#945;i alpelisib or the AKTi capivasertib synergistically inhibited growth of both cell lines (CI values, 0.07-0.86). AR transcriptional reporter activity was not altered by any of these treatments. Treatment with palbociclib monotherapy (24 h) suppressed p-Rb and increased phosphorylation of AKT<sup>S473<\/sup> and its substrates FOXO3A, GSK3&#946;, and PRAS40, suggesting PI3K\/AKT signaling mediates an adaptive response to CDK4\/6 blockade. In MDA-MB-453 cells, palbociclib-induced phosphorylation of AKT substrates was suppressed by treatment with capivasertib but not with alpelisib alone or with the PI3K&#946;\/&#948; inhibitor AZD8186, suggesting that the compensatory activation of AKT was due to a mechanism independent of the PI3K isozymes. We next used RICTOR siRNAs to block mTORC2-mediated phosphorylation AKT<sup>S473<\/sup> after palbociclib treatment. Gene silencing of RICTOR reduced levels of the mTORC2 substrate p-SGK1<sup>S422<\/sup> but did not block phosphorylation of AKT<sup>S473<\/sup> and its substrates in palbociclib-treated cells, suggesting that this adaptative response was mTORC2-independent. Mean CI values showed that the combination of palbociclib\/capivasertib was clearly more synergistic than palbociclib\/alpelisib in both cells lines (mean CI, 0.29 vs. 0.78). Currently, we are comparing both combinations in mice bearing established MDA-MB-453 xenografts. Further investigation of the mechanisms of adaptive activation of AKT upon blockade of CDK4\/6 in TNBC cells are in progress. In sum, addition of an AKT inhibitor, but not PI3K inhibitors, to palbociclib suppressed the rebound activation of AKT following treatment with the CDK4\/6i, supporting a testable therapeutic strategy in LAR TNBC with intact Rb.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),CDK4\/6 inhibitors,AKT\/PKB activation,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maria del Rosario Chica-Parrado<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Gun Min Kin<sup><\/sup>, Chang-Ching Lin<sup><\/sup>, Kyung-min Lee<sup><\/sup>, Fabiana Napolitano<sup><\/sup>, Dan Ye<sup><\/sup>, Emmanuel Bikorimana<sup><\/sup>, Saurabh Mendirata<sup><\/sup>, Ariella Hanker<sup><\/sup>, Carlos  L.

Approved targeted monotherapies have seen limited success due to lack of effective combinations or identification of sensitive patient populations. Hence, there is a need to develop alternative strategies to identify effective combinations for individual patients and specific TCL sub-populations. We interrogated the potential for an ex vivo combinatorial drug sensitivity platform, Quadratic Phenotypic Optimization Platform (QPOP), in a clinical study for relapsed\/refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (RR-NHL) to identify effective subtype-specific combinations through a functional combinatorial precision medicine approach.<br \/>We analyzed 37 primary samples from patients with RR-NHL of both T- and NK-cell origin in Singapore, with disease amenable to biopsy or blood\/ marrow aspiration. Single cell suspensions from tumor samples were treated with a panel of 12 drugs with known preclinical or clinical efficacy against TCL. Post-drug treatment cell viability was used as a phenotypic input for QPOP analysis, which maps experimental data points to a second-order quadratic function to predict cell killing efficacies for all possible permutations of drug combinations. Romidepsin-based combinations appeared among the top ranked QPOP-derived 2-drug combinations with predicted output cutoff &#60; 0.55 in 91.8% of samples treated with similar QPOP drug panel. Among these combinations, combinations with copanlisib, ifosfamide and venetoclax were the most frequently occurring doublet, appearing in 24, 14 and 8 samples, respectively. A total of 10 patients received QPOP-derived romidepsin-based combinations at physicians&#8217; discretion. We noted outcomes of stable disease or better in 7\/10 (70%) patients, with clinical benefit seen in 2 complete responses and 2 partial responses (40%). Thus, romidepsin-based combinations showed improved outcomes for TCL patients compared to the prior reported overall response rate of 25% that led to romidepsin&#8217;s approval as monotherapy. This study showed the clinical utility of QPOP in identifying combination therapy-specific sub-populations in TCL. Targeted agents, such as romidepsin, copanlisib and venetoclax, that have previously been explored as single agents in TCL were predicted by QPOP to be more effective in the proper combination for the proper patient. This study demonstrates that functional combinatorial precision medicine platforms, such as QPOP, may improve clinical outcomes through identification of more appropriate combination therapies. This work, as well as additional studies in other cancer types, provide evidence towards the need for optimal combination therapy design and the potential of functional precision medicine to improve precision and personalized cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,Precision medicine,Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Edward Kai-Hua Chow<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Masturah Rashid<sup>2<\/sup>, Sanjay Prasad De Mel<sup>3<\/sup>, Jasmine Goh<sup>1<\/sup>, Anand Jeyasekharan<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Cancer Science Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore,<sup>2<\/sup>KYAN Therapeutics, Singapore, Singapore,<sup>3<\/sup>2NUS Center for Cancer Research (N2CR), Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore,<sup>4<\/sup>Cancer Science Institute, National University Singapore, Singapore, Singapore","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ea0ded81-b0c4-4405-9c6e-135bc382ca32","ControlNumber":"8054","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;E.

Substantial efforts have been made to target MAPK signaling pathways in CRC, particularly blocking oncogenic mutations in KRAS or BRAF. However, standard treatments targeting MAPK signaling have demonstrated limited activities in CRC patients and are in strong need of improved efficacies. Thus, we investigated how the combination of BET inhibitor treatment could affect MAPK signaling activation.<br \/>Methods: We performed a wide-scale drug combination study testing 15 drug combinations using CRC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. PDX models were treated for 21 days, and tumor volume and body weight changes were measured for assessment of treatment responses and toxicities. For the BET inhibitor (iBET-151) plus MEK inhibitor (binimetinib or trametinib) combination, RNA-seq and RPPA was performed on PDX tumor tissues collected after 7 days of treatment for pharmacodynamics study (n=3 per treatment condition). Tumors collected on day 21 were sequenced for H3K27Ac ChIP-seq and IHCs for understanding epigenomic changes in active enhancers and target validations.<br \/>Results: Our preliminary screening of 15 drug combinations in CRC PDX models have shown the most promising and active responses in a combination of BETi with MEKi (5 out of 20 PDXs obtained tumor regression). Preclinical H3K27ac ChIP-seq data has shown lost enhancer peaks after BET inhibition were significantly associated with RAS signaling pathways (q&#60;0.05). Gene set enrichment analysis on preclinical transcriptomic data also demonstrated downregulation of KRAS-signaling in BETi plus MEKi combination treatment compared to MEKi as monotherapy (p&#60;0.05). MAPK activation scores (MPAS) were also significantly downregulated in transcriptomic and enhancer levels under BETi plus MEKi combinations compared to MEKi. Downstream transcription factors of MAPK signaling pathways, such as MYC and FOSL1, were synergistically downregulated in combination with BETi. Also, we found downregulation of EREG, a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, under BET inhibition which may play a role in MAPK downregulation together with standard therapy.<br \/>Conclusions: Some studies have shown MAPK signaling activation as a resistance mechanism of BET inhibition in multiple cancer types. However, the understanding of the crosstalk between the activity of BET inhibition in a combination with MAPK signaling inhibition is limited in CRC. We found BET inhibition induces deeper inhibition of MAPK pathway activation together with standard targeted therapies. Our data demonstrated transcriptomic and epigenetic levels of the mechanism of BETi activity together with MAPK inhibition in CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Combination therapy,BET inhibitor,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hey Min Lee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Alexey Sorokin<sup>1<\/sup>, Preeti Kanikarla Marie<sup>1<\/sup>, Saikat Chowdhury<sup>1<\/sup>, Anand Singh<sup>2<\/sup>, Amanda Anderson<sup>1<\/sup>, Jumanah Yousef Alshenaifi<sup>1<\/sup>, Funda Meric-Bernstam<sup>3<\/sup>, Kunal Rai<sup>2<\/sup>, Scott Kopetz<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>GI Medical Oncology Department, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>Genomic Medicine Department, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>3<\/sup>Investigational Cancer Therapeutics Department, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d11bc6d8-efd6-4efd-8112-15ca29f3d779","ControlNumber":"3216","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

Our previous study suggested that PI3K and FAK form a positive feedback loop to modulate ERK activation. We tested combined inhibition of FAK and PI3K on the growth of cervical and pancreatic cancer in vitro. We found that FAK and PI3K inhibitors synergistically inhibited the growth of some cervical cancer and pancreatic cancer cell lines. The synergy was due to both increased apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation. Molecularly, FAK inhibition caused downregulation of PI3K and ERK signaling in cervical cancer but not pancreatic cancer cells. Interestingly, PI3K inhibitors induced activation of several RTK including insulin R and IGF-1R in cervical cancer cells, as well as EGFR, Her2, Her3, Axl, and EphA2 in pancreatic cancer cells. Together, our results show the promise of combining FAK and PI3K inhibition for cervical cancer and pancreatic cancer treatment, but biomarkers for sensitivity to the combination are needed, and concomitant RTK inhibition may be required to combat potential resistance to the combination.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Signal transduction inhibitors,Targeted therapy,Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Chao-Cheng Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Suyang Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Jr-Ming Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Chuan-Hsiang Huang<\/b><sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Pathology, Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore, MD,<sup>2<\/sup>Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"65a380e4-25ae-4a9a-8024-1b3172ad1b96","ControlNumber":"2408","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors<b> <\/b>(TKIs) are approved as a first-line treatment for unresectable&nbsp;HCC. Lenvatinib and cabozantinib are two of the most used TKIs, but the therapeutic duration is limited due to&nbsp;the development of drug resistance. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of resistance and combining TKIs with other drugs antagonizing resistance should lead to antitumor synergy, eliminating drug resistance. It turns out that the simultaneous use of TKIs together with an inhibitor of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) prevents the development of drug resistance, leading to a durable response. SCD1 is the enzyme responsible for <i>de novo<\/i> fatty acid (FAs) synthesis, converting saturated fatty acids (SFAs) into monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). MUFAs are an alternative energy source to glucose, integral to cellular membranes, and prevent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and other signaling pathways. In our laboratory, we developed a novel, highly specific SCD1 inhibitor - SSI-4. We have tested the biological activity of SSI-4 against different HCC cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) mouse models. Of the twelve tested HCC cell lines, four were highly sensitive to SSI-4 (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 1-50 nM). Other cell lines showed moderate or no sensitivity to SSI-4. We tested the concomitant use of SSI-4 with lenvatinib and cabozantinib, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) FDA-approved for HCC, in HCC cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i> and using HCC PDX <i>in vivo<\/i> mouse models. Our studies showed that the combination of the SCD1 inhibitor with both lenvatinib and cabozantinib showed a highly synergistic effect and no development of drug resistance i.e. durable response versus single TKI therapy. Ongoing mechanistic studies are examining whether known molecular targets of tested TKI&#8217;s such as VEGFR1, 2, and 3, PDGFR&#945;, FGFR, KIT, and RET dominate in HCC drug resistance to lenvatinib and cabozantinib, and how the use of SSI-4 overcomes the phenomenon of resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Targeted therapy,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Synergism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Justyna  J.

Paxalisib is a highly brain penetrant PI3k inhibitor which acts upstream of mTOR to simultaneously inhibit mTORC1\/2. Paxalisib is well-tolerated in ongoing pediatric clinical trials. In murine orthotopic xenograft models of AT\/RT, Paxalisib significantly extended survival (CHLA-06: 40 to 54 days, p=0.001; BT12: 21 to 35 days, p=0.02). However, to improve the durability of this single agent therapy, we evaluated the efficacy of rational therapeutic partners. Analysis of RNAseq following mTOR inhibition (mTORi) of 4 cell lines representative of AT\/RT showed an upregulation of genes associated with the integrated stress response (ISR), (<i>ATF4<\/i>: CHLA-06, <i>t-<\/i>test p&#60;0.05; <i>CHOP<\/i>: CHLA-02, CHLA-06 <i>t-<\/i>test p&#60;0.001). The activation of the ISR is further suggested through induction of <i>PPP1R15A<\/i>, a gene whose activation is closely associated with stress events and leads to downstream cell growth arrest and apoptosis (BT37 <i>t<\/i>-test p&#60;0.001, CHLA-02, CHLA-06, CHLA-266, <i>t-<\/i>test p&#60;0.01). Gemcitabine is a pyrimidine nucleoside prodrug, which inhibits DNA synthesis and induces DNA damage. As a result, Gemcitabine also induces phosphorylation of eIF2&#945; and the activation of the ISR. While the ISR can be protective, intense or prolonged activation leads to cell death. We therefore hypothesized that Paxalisib would combine with Gemcitabine to hyper-activate the ISR and drive AT\/RT cell death. Through Western blot analysis, we demonstrate that combination therapy increases phospho-eIF2&#945;, ATF4, and CHOP compared to DMSO control. Furthermore, we demonstrate that combination therapy increases apoptosis (Western blot cPARP, MUSE Annexin V Assay) and synergizes to decrease AT\/RT cell growth (SynergyFinder BLISS score CHLA-06: 16.8, BT12: 14.3, CHLA-266: 13.9, BT37: 11.4, CHLA-05: 10.4). Ongoing treatment of mice bearing CHLA06 orthotopic tumors demonstrate that combination therapy further extends median survival. Our studies suggest that pharmacologically activating the ISR may be an effective strategy to target AT\/RT and combination of Paxalisib and Gemcitabine may be an effective treatment to help extend survival in this deadly disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Integrated stress response,mTOR,ATRT,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tyler Findlay<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kristen Malebranche<sup><\/sup>, Anupa Geethadevi<sup><\/sup>, Eric Raabe<sup><\/sup>, Charles Eberhart<sup><\/sup>, Jeffrey Rubens<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"38563b42-7ff3-485d-b732-298fd89f7f15","ControlNumber":"6881","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

Investigators have used either synthetic nanoparticles or fusion protein to deliver Fc-IgG2b to initiate Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) but reports are showing a lack of ADCC following tagging with gold nanoparticles. To overcome this, in our lab, we developed engineered exosomes in non-tumorous cells, HEK293, to carry therapeutic Fc-mIgG2b to enhance ADCC and to carry peptide to deplete CD206+ M2 macrophages.

It is estimated that more than 13,000 new cases of GBM will be diagnosed this year in the United States. Despite multidisciplinary treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, the five-year survival rate for GBM patients is only 6.8 percent and has shown no notable improvement in the last three decades. There have only been five drugs and one device ever approved by the FDA for the treatment of GBM since it was first identified in the scientific literature in the 1920&#8217;s. Our <i>in vitro<\/i> studies suggested that first-in-class small-molecule imipridone TIC10\/ONC201 can inactivate ERK\/AKT, induce the integrated stress response (ISR), upregulate pro-apoptotic TRAIL receptor DR5, deplete cancer stem cells, and induce mitochondrial dysfunction, growth arrest or cell death in GBM cells. Knockdown of ClpP protects GBM cells from ONC201 but not TMZ. ONC201 crosses the blood-brain barrier and has induced durable tumor regressions in adult and pediatric H3K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma patients. We hypothesized that ONC201 may synergize with radiotherapy and temozolomide in GBM. GBM mouse orthotopic models were established through intracranial injection of luciferase expressing U251 GBM cells with a KOPF model 940 small animal stereotaxic frame and a Stoelting Quintessential Stereotaxic Injector. Tumor formation and growth was confirmed with bioluminescence imaging. Randomized treatment group mice received weekly treatment of ONC201 (100 mg\/kg p.o.) and\/or radiotherapy (2 Gy local irradiation) and\/or TMZ (20 mg\/kg i.p.) for four weeks for long term survival and tumor monitoring or one week for short term biomarker studies. We observed that the triple combination of ONC201, radiotherapy and TMZ significantly prolongs survival and reduces tumor burden compared to single treatment and dual combinations. Short term biomarker studies demonstrated that triple combination treatment decreases tumor cell proliferation, induces more apoptosis and inhibits ClpX to unleash mitochondrial ClpP. Our data support further development of the triple combination regimen of ONC201, TMZ and radiation therapy for GBM first-line treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,ONC201,Radiotherapy,Temozolomide,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lanlan Zhou<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Laura Jinxuan Wu<sup><\/sup>, Jun Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Andrew George<sup><\/sup>, Marina Hahn<sup><\/sup>, Leiqing Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Attila  A.

It is associated with poorer outcomes as recurrent disease tends to be resistant to chemotherapy. Given the dearth of proven targeted therapies in this setting and the tendency for serous ECs to have homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), this study aimed to test the synergy between poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) and SN38, an active metabolite of DNA topoisomerase I, irinotecan. PARPis are currently FDA approved in ovarian cancer and have their greatest efficacy in tumors with HRD while topoisomerase inhibitors are a standard chemotherapy option for recurrent cancer.<br \/>Methods: A genomic instability score (GIS) was derived from low-pass whole genome sequencing-based bioinformatics analysis according to three previously reported HRD metrics: telomeric allelic imbalance, large state transitions, and loss of heterozygosity. GIS was calculated for 34 patient derived xenograft (PDX) tumors, of which eight had serous histology. PARPi, rucaparib, and SN38 were used to treat EC PDX tumors in e<i>x vivo<\/i> 3D cell culture experiments using RealTime Glo for viability after 4-5 days of drug exposure. Synergy was assessed by calculating the combination index (CI) using Chou-Talalay method.<br \/>Results: GIS &#8805; 42 was noted in 62.5% (5\/8) of serous EC PDX tumors and only 19.2% (5\/26) of non-serous EC PDX tumors. Synergy (CI &#60; 1.0) between rucaparib and SN38 was demonstrated in 85.7% (6\/7) of serous EC PDX <i>ex vivo<\/i> 3D cell culture experiments, but only 62.5% (10\/16) of non-serous EC PDX tumors.<br \/>Conclusions: Most serous EC PDX tumors had a high GIS, consistent with HRD, when compared to a minority of non-serous histologies. Furthermore, combination therapy of rucaparib and SN38 had a synergistic effect in almost all serous EC PDX models, while still being effective in a majority of non-serous models. Additional PDX tumors need to be assessed to establish the predictive value of a GIS on synergy between rucaparib and SN38. Further <i>in vivo<\/i> studies are also needed to confirm these <i>ex vivo<\/i> findings of synergy. Ultimately, the hope is to generate preclinical data which justifies the use of PARPis in serous ECs as monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,PARP inhibitors,Topoisomerase I inhibitor,Synergism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Conway Xu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Xiaonan Hou<sup><\/sup>, Erik Jessen<sup><\/sup>, Chen Wang<sup><\/sup>, S.

Although the majority of OC patients respond to chemotherapeutic drugs, more than 70% of the patients relapse and die as a result of chemoresistance. Therefore, novel therapeutics are warranted to prevent chemoresistance and treat the relapsed disease to improve prognosis. Many cancer cells depend on Glutamine as major carbon source and these cells have high Glutaminase (GLS) expression, an enzyme that converts Glutamine to Glutamate. Chemo-resistant OC cells have elevated levels of GLS, which confirms their increased dependency on glutamine metabolism. Based on these observations, we postulated that GLS inhibition may attenuate the aggressive growth of GLS<sup> high<\/sup> OC cells and may sensitize to the agents that can further potentiate these effects. Interestingly, GLS inhibition using a clinical-stage drug CB839 caused replication stress and activated DNA damage checkpoint protein 1 (CHK1) mediated cell cycle arrest. These novel findings suggested a role for CHK1 in protecting GLS inhibition-induced DNA damage by facilitating the timely repair of DNA breaks. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that GLS inhibition in combination with CHK1 inhibition may cause synergistic lethality in chemo-resistant and GLS<sup>high<\/sup> OC cells. We evaluated the combination of GLS inhibitor CB839 and CHK1 inhibitor Prexasertib. Our results demonstrate that GLS inhibition-induced CHK1 phosphorylation is significantly attenuated by Prexasertib treatment. Similarly, combined treatment of CB839 and Prexasertib showed significantly elevated levels of DNA damage as measured by COMET assays, replication stress-mediated DNA damage responses, and synergistic OC cell lethality compared to individual drug treatments. Furthermore, CB839 and Prexasertib combination was more synergistic in cells that expressed high GLS compared to low GLS-expressing OC cells indicating the specificity of the combination of these drugs. Together, our studies identified a novel connection between metabolic and DNA damage checkpoint pathways in OC and propose a novel synergistic lethality-based combination therapy to treat chemo-resistant and aggressive OC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemoresistance,Ovarian cancer,Chk1,DNA damage response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Pamela Luna<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Ganesh Acharya<sup><\/sup>, Damieanus Ochola<sup><\/sup>, Swetha Peddibhotla<sup><\/sup>, Chinnadurai Mani<sup><\/sup>, Mark B.

Children and adolescents with positive end-of-induction minimal residual disease (MRD) have an overall survival lower than 30%. However, data regarding therapeutic alternatives for this disease is nearly non-existent, emphasizing the critical need for new or adjunctive therapies that can improve outcomes. We previously reported on the therapeutic efficacy of venetoclax (ABT-199) in hypodiploid B-ALL but with limitations as monotherapy<i> (Diaz-Flores, Cancer Research, 2019)<\/i>. Accordingly, hypodiploid B-ALL patient derived xenografts treated with Venetoclax developed therapeutic resistance over time. To better understand the mechanism of resistance that arises following inhibition of BCL-2, we first generated a hypodiploid cell line (NALM-16) deficient in BCL-2. Given that BCL-2 plays an essential role in B-cell function standard CRISPR\/Cas9 knockout strategies greatly impaired survival. We overcame this limitation by using a magnetic levitation system (the LeviCell by LevitasBio). Analysis of the surviving clones identified an increase in MCL1 (<b>Fig. 1A<\/b>). We then harnessed unbiased drug screen (&#62;1800 bioactive compounds) followed by selection of synergistic drug combinations identified Dinaciclib as an efficient drug combination with Venetoclax in eliminating leukemic cells in vitro. Interestingly, mechanistic studies identified that Dinaciclib, through transcription regulation (RNApol II) significantly modulates MCL-1. Data using knock-outs and knock-ins of MCL-1 indicated how MCL-1 only becomes essential for survival when Venetoclax is present. Preclinical studies using patient derived xenografts indicated that, while none of the drug monotherapies achieved complete blast elimination, venetoclax + dinaciblib led to complete resolution of the leukemic burden within all solid organs analyzed (<b>Fig. 1B<\/b>). This combination therapy was relatively well tolerated. This study also indicates that high BCL-2 and MCL-1 levels with concomitant BIM, BAD and\/or PUMA levels, represent biomarkers for response to this combination. In summary, our study identified a highly synergistic drug combination, venetoclax and dinaciclib, for the treatment of hypodiploid B ALL, an aggressive leukemia with few effective current therapies. Finally, the promising results presented in this study may prompt further studies to support the inclusion of hypodiploid and other B-ALL patients to clinical trials combining phase I\/II drugs against BCL-2 (mainly venetoclax) and CDK9 (dinaciclib, alvocidib, flavopiridol, SNS-032) or MCL-1 (MIK-665).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute lymphoblastic,Venetoclax,Mcl-1,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ernesto Diaz-Flores<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Holly Pariury<sup><\/sup>, Mignon Loh<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UCSF - University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0f55cfcb-ce6e-410e-ba37-58279fffe18e","ControlNumber":"3122","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>E.

The hyperactivity of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway has been identified in the majority of pediatric glioma suggesting its therapeutic potential. However, pharmacologic targeting single MAPK pathway&#8217;s component is limited due to the development of drug resistance and differential response associated with tumor molecular landscape. Therefore, effective combination strategy in the framework of precision medicine is needed. Here we report combination benefit and molecular underpinning therapeutic response of brain penetrant MEK inhibitor (mirdametinib) and SHP2 inhibitor (SHP099) in a pediatric patient derived xenograft (PDX) and xenoline developed at our institution. Our model was derived from a pediatric patient who was diagnosed with rare high-grade subtype of glioma, anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, and did not respond to MEK inhibitor, trametinib. Integrative multi-omics revealed molecular fidelity between our model and its patient tumor counterpart including the presence of 7q35 fusion, <i>CDC52SE2-BRAF<\/i>, <i>CDKN2A\/B<\/i> loss, and MAPK pathway hyperactivation. <i>In vitro<\/i> studies using our xenoline IU-X128 demonstrated synergy between SHP099 and mirdametinib to curtail cell proliferation (p&#60;0.05). Moreover, this combination was well tolerated in our PDX, IU-RHT128, and potentiated anti-tumor effect of the single agent within clinically achievable doses. Reverse Phase Proteome Array (RPPA) identified MAPK reactivation via Mushasi RNA binding protein-PI3K-AKT crosstalk as a potential innate resistance mechanism to single agent MEK inhibitor in the PDX tumor. Further, tandem mass tags (TMT)-LC-MS\/MS profiling on tumor treated with single agent SHP099 or mirdametinib and their combination revealed that combination therapy does not only revert certain proteome and phosphoproteome reprogramming from single agent treatment but also created a novel landscape which can be associated with anti-tumor effect. In this case, kinase network reprograming leading to MAPK reactivation was identified in mirdametinib treated tumor which was attenuated in the combination treatment. In summary, our results demonstrated that combination SHP099 and mirdametinib is superior to single agent alone in the pediatric A-PXA brain tumor model with proteome and phosphoproteome reprogramming of multiple networks as potential molecular mechanisms underlying therapeutic benefit of combination therapy. Ultimately, clinical translation of this finding will potentially benefit patient of this malignant rare pediatric glioma subset which currently does not have standard therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,MEK inhibitor,SHP2 inhibitor,mirdametinib,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nur  P.

Many nods of the MAPK pathway are considered as promising anti-tumor drug targets, such as RTKs, KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>, RAF, MEK1\/2, and ERK1\/2. Multiple inhibitors targeting proteins on MAPK pathway have been developed for cancer treatment. However, the effectiveness of these inhibitors is often limited due to acquired drug resistance via pathway feedback activation, indicating the necessity of combination strategies to help block reactivation or bypass activation of MAPK pathway. ATG-017 is an oral, potent, and highly selective inhibitor of ERK1\/2, which is under Phase 1 clinical investigation. This study tested the<i> in vivo<\/i> antitumor effects induced by the combination of ATG-017, with EGFR inhibitor (Osimertinib), KRAS<sup>G12C <\/sup>inhibitor (ATG-012), CDK4\/6 inhibitor (Abemaciclib) or PD-L1 inhibitor (Atezolizumab), in preclinical tumor models.<br \/>Methods: The<i> in vivo<\/i> combinations of the drugs were tested in NCI-H1975, NCI-H358 (non-small cell lung cancer) or EL4 (T cell Lymphoma) CDX mouse models. The tumor bearing mouse were treated with vehicle control, ATG-017 (15 or 25 mg\/kg, QD), Osimertinib (1mg\/kg, QD), ATG-012 (10mg\/kg, QD), Abemaciclib (25mg\/kg, QD), Atezolizumab (10mg\/kg, BIW) or the combination for 9 to 21 days. The tumor size was measured twice a week and tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was evaluated compared with vehicle group. Tumor tissues were collected for tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) analysis using Flow cytometry or multiplex IHC.<br \/>Results: In the NCI-H1975 CDX<i> in vivo<\/i> study, the monotherapy of ATG-017 and Osimertinib induced TGIs of 61.95% and 79.18%, respectively on day 17 after grouping. The combination of ATG-017 and Osimertinib showed 101.85% TGI. In the NCI-H358 CDX <i>in vivo<\/i> study, the monotherapy of ATG-017, ATG-012, and combination induced TGI of 44.29% ,73.71% and 97.13%, respectively on day 8 after grouping.

Here, we optimized a method for testing the drug sensitivity of PDOCs and evaluated whether this preclinical model could be a valid tool for rapidly determining the patient&#8217;s tumor response profile to approved and alternative therapies.<br \/>METHODS PDOCs were generated from melanoma metastases (&#62; 60 specimens) after mechanical or enzymatic dissociation. Tissue fragments (&#60;70um) were harvested, embedded in 3D collagen beads (1.5 mg\/mL type I collagen), and cultured in a 96-well plate for 6 days, maintaining tumor and stromal viability. More than 20 primary cell lines from the same samples were also stabilized. The melanoma cells or the PDOCs were left untreated or treated with the patient&#8217;s own therapy or with alternative drugs, and the efficacy of treatments was evaluated by MTT assay and flow cytometry. CD8+ T cell infiltration and cytokine secretion were also investigated.<br \/>RESULTS The first experiments were set up to validate PDOCs as predictive preclinical models of patient response to therapy. We tested approved melanoma therapies (i.e., the combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors, or anti-PD-1 antibodies) on the same melanoma specimens at the IDI and IEO institutes. More than 10 different samples were compared, finding reproducible results between the two Institutions. Furthermore, drug response in PDOCs was comparable to the clinical response of matched patients undergoing the tested therapy, demonstrating PDOCs are reliable predictive tools. Then, we used primary cell lines to screen a pool of ten different targeted agents selected through functional screening of a bioactive library of 512 compounds on patient-derived xenografts, and based on known drug resistance mechanisms in melanoma. The three best-performing compounds were subsequently studied in PDOCs as single agents or in combination with immunotherapy. We found high heterogeneity of drug efficacy in different melanoma samples with no obvious correlation to BRAF or NRAS mutations, metastasis type, or patients&#8217; prior therapies. Of note, in some cases, the combination with an anti-PD-1 inhibitor significantly improved the efficacy of one or more of the three drugs.<br \/>CONCLUSIONS We optimized and validated PDOCs as personalized preclinical models suitable for assessing the drug sensitivity\/resistance profile of individual patient-derived melanomas. By retaining tumor stromal components and heterogeneity, PDOCs could be used to predict patients&#8217; clinical response to currently approved agents, helping oncologists expedite decision-making when several treatment options are possible. Furthermore, the model could be used to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative treatments on tumors resistant to approved therapies, and to explore new drug combinations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Preclinical testing,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Antonella Bresin<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Fiorenza Lotti<sup>2<\/sup>, Lauretta Levati<sup>1<\/sup>, Pier  F.

Achieving deeper and more durable responses in these patients remain as major challenges. Preclinical and clinical translation research highlights adaptive feedback reactivation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade as key molecular mechanisms driving primary and acquired resistance to KRAS G12C inhibitors. Concurrent inhibition of KRAS G12C and downstream MAPK pathway is thus an attractive combination strategy to improve clinical outcomes for KRAS G12C-mutant population.<br \/>D3S-002 is a potent and selective kinase inhibitor targeting ERK1\/2, the final node of the RAS-MAPK pathway and the central mediator of the feedback activation loop. To investigate the combination effect of D3S-002 with KRAS G12C inhibitor D3S-001, this study utilized multiple preclinical in vivo models including cancer cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) tumors that are sensitive to, or primarily resistant to KRAS G12C inhibitors, and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors that have progressed on KRAS G12C inhibitor treatment in the clinic. In NCI-H358 NSCLC and SW837 CRC models that are sensitive to KRAS G12C inhibitor monotherapy, adding D3S-002 to D3S-001 or to D3S-001 and cetuximab doublet regimen led to faster, deeper, and more durable anti-tumor responses at dose levels that are well tolerated in mice with no body weight loss observed. In NCI-H2122 NSCLC model that is primarily resistant to KRAS G12C inhibitor alone, the addition of D3S-002 resulted in near complete tumor growth inhibition.<br \/>Furthermore, CR9537 PDX model was established from tumor biopsy of a CRC patient who had progressed on combination treatment of KRAS G12C inhibitor MRTX849 and a SHP2 inhibitor in a clinical trial. Next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis identified secondary KRAS Q61H mutation as an acquired resistance mechanism. In this PDX model, KRAS G12C inhibitor, D3S-001 or MRTX849, monotherapy only achieved approximately 50% tumor growth inhibition, highlighting the acquired resistant phenotype. Adding D3S-002 to D3S-001 or MRTX849 resulted in over 80% tumor growth inhibition and significantly prolonged survival, suggesting the combination treatment can be beneficial for KRAS G12C inhibitor pre-treated patient population.<br \/>Collectively, vertical inhibition by concurrently targeting KRAS G12C and ERK1\/2 with respective inhibitor D3S-001 and D3S-002 demonstrated enhanced anti-tumor activity in NSCLC and CRC models with different sensitivity to KRAS G12C inhibitor monotherapy. These results provide a strong rationale for further investigation of the combination strategy of D3S-001 and D3S-002 in KRAS G12C-mutant solid tumors in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,ERK,Combination therapy,Adenocarcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jing Zhang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jingtao Lu<sup><\/sup>, Zhiqiang Zheng<sup><\/sup>, Jiang Lu<sup><\/sup>, Allison Wang<sup><\/sup>, Jia Wang<sup><\/sup>, Janet Chen<sup><\/sup>, Haopeng Rui<sup><\/sup>, Cheng Chen<sup><\/sup>, Zhi Jian Chen<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>D3 Bio (Wuxi) Co.

Despite significant advances in prostate cancer treatment over the past few decades, resistance inevitably develops with certain therapies, including second-generation anti-androgens; new case numbers also keep climbing each year, leading to one in every eight men being diagnosed with prostate cancer during his lifetime. Therapies targeting the androgen receptor (AR) as the main driver of prostate cancer lead to various mechanisms of resistance and promote disease progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which has a median survival of only 9-36 months. Amongst recurrent CRPC, 17%-30% of patients develop neuroendocrine prostate cancer which is characterized by it&#8217;s unique histopathology and loss of AR signaling. Our previous study demonstrated that autophagy blockade via PIKfyve inhibition has preferential cytotoxicity in neuroendocrine prostate cancer over prostatic adenocarcinoma leading us to further validate the role of AR signaling in PIKfyve blockade sensitivity. Thus, we postulate that androgen signaling attenuates the dependency of prostate cancer on PIKfyve, while on the other hand, AR antagonist may sensitize prostatic adenocarcinoma to PIKfyve inhibition.<br \/><b>Method <\/b><br \/>Several AR positive prostate cancer cell lines were examined for combinational effect of AR antagonists and PIKfyve inhibitors <i>in vitro<\/i> with synergistic scores calculated. A pair of isogenic LNCaP cells with proficient AR signaling (LNCaP-parental) and deficient AR signaling (LNCaP AR-null) were used for PIKfyve inhibitor sensitivity. Additionally, two AR positive cell line-derived xenografts (LNCaP and VCaP) were established <i>in vivo<\/i> for combinational assessment of AR antagonist Enzalutamide and PIKfyve inhibitor ESK981. Tumor growth inhibition were monitored pre- and post- treatments. On target assessment were examined for downstream targets of AR antagonist, as well as LC3-lipidation for PIKfyve inhibition. <i>In situ<\/i> cell death events of treated tumors <i>in vivo<\/i> were evaluated by TUNEL assay.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b><br \/>We have discovered that inhibition of AR signaling by Enzalutamide demonstrated strong synergistic anti-proliferative effects with PIKfyve inhibition by ESK981. Similarly, using a pair of isogenic LNCaP cells with proficient (LNCaP-parental) and deficient AR signaling (LNCaP AR-null), we showed that loss of AR signaling notably increased the sensitivity of LNCaP cells to PIKfyve inhibition. Concurrent treatment with Enzalutamide and ESK981 <i>in vivo<\/i> triggered greater tumor inhibition and more robust <i>in situ<\/i> cell death events than either agent alone. Collectively, PIKfyve may have a context-dependent role in AR signaling-dependent and -independent prostate cancer, so that by co-targeting AR signaling and PIKfyve, therapeutic outcome of prostate adenocarcinoma can be improved.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Autophagy,Androgen deprivation therapy,Neuroendocrine tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yuanyuan Qiao<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sarah Nicole Yee<sup><\/sup>, Caleb Cheng<sup><\/sup>, Yang Zheng<sup><\/sup>, Jie Luo<sup><\/sup>, Yi Bao<sup><\/sup>, Xia Jiang<sup><\/sup>, Xuhong Cao<sup><\/sup>, Yuping Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Arul  M.

According to the 2019 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program database, the 5-year survival rates of regional and metastatic bladder cancer are 36.3% and 4.6%, respectively. Patients who received radical cystectomy suffer from a high recurrence rate of up to 30%. As for metastatic UC, only half of the patients respond to standard platinum-based chemotherapy, with 20% of 5-year overall survival. CDK12 shows transcription regulatory effects via regulating RNA polymerase II CTD phosphorylation. In our research, we used CDK12 selective inhibitor SR-4835 to treat the UC cell lines including T24, BFTC905, RT4, and cisplatin-resistant T24\/R. MTT assay result has demonstrated the cytotoxicity of SR-4835 against UC cells. Using q-RT-PCR and immunoblotting, we have confirmed the reduction of ATM mRNA and protein expression after the treatment of SR-4835. The expression of DNA damage marker gamma-H2AX was also elevated. Flow cytometry data indicated an increase in apoptotic population after treatment. According to these findings, we presume SR-4835 can lead to a DNA damage-induced apoptosis process. Furthermore, we also observed the inhibition of AKT pathway, which is related to cell survival and proliferation. Due to the effects of DNA-repair inhibition, we aim to combine SR-4835 to enhance the anti-cancer effects of cisplatin. The results of UC mice xenograft have confirmed that SR-4835 and cisplatin display a synergistic effect against UC tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. We will further dissect the mechanisms of the <i>in vitro<\/i> synergistic effects between SR-4835 and cisplatin using immunoblotting, RNA-sequencing, comet assay, and various functional assays.

Recent evidence points to cellular senescence, a response to oncogenic- and therapy-induced genotoxic stress, and its associated proinflammatroy secretory phenotype (SASP) as an emerging hallmark of cancer. Hence, targeting senescence and its associated tumor-promoting activities is emerging as a novel and promising therapeutic strategy but largely unexplored in lung cancer.<br \/><b>Experimental Procedures<\/b> Our study includes a variety of methodologies, including: - Functional in vitro analyses: proliferation, colony formation, tumor spheres, migration assays. High throughput unbiased analyses: RNAseq, proteomics and microenvironment microarrays (MEMA). - In vivo models of lung cancer: xenografts, orthotopic and genetically engineered mouse models. Longitudinal tumor burden by IVIS and microCT and mouse survival. - Clinical samples: Histological and in silico analyses.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> Here we show that cisplatin-derived SASP enhances the malignant phenotype of lung cancer cells. Using xenograft, orthotopic and KrasG12V-driven murine NSCLC models, we demonstrate that cisplatin-induced senescent cells strongly promote tumor progression. Mechanistically, we find that a TGF-&#946;-enriched SASP drives pro-proliferative effects through TGF&#946;R1 and Akt\/mTOR pathway activation. We validate the translational relevance of chemotherapy-induced SASP using clinical NSCLC samples from a trial with patients who received neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. Importantly, TGF&#946;R1 inhibition with galunisertib or senolytic treatment significantly reduces tumor promotion driven by cisplatin-induced senescence. Finally, we demonstrate, using distinct murine NSCLC models, that addition of TGFBR1 inhibitors to platinum-based chemotherapy reduces tumor burden and improves survival, providing pre-clinical proof-of-concept for future trial designs on combination therapies.<b><\/b><br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Conclusions and Impact<\/b> We regard this work as a major conceptual dissection of tumor-promoting activities of therapy-induced senescence, and a preclinical advance in the management of lung cancer with potential wide therapeutic applications in precision medicine.

We have used quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) of clinically approved or investigational agents to identify candidate compounds for ATC therapy. As monotherapy for most cancers is not effective, we used combination drug matrix screening of highly active compounds from our single agent qHTS to identify compound combinations that may show synergistic effect. In this study, we evaluated the anticancer activity of nitazoxanide and auranofin combination treatment and its mechanism of action and biomarkers of treatment response in <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> models of ATC.<br \/>Experimental Design: We used four (8505C, C643, SW1736, THJ16T) ATC cell lines in <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> ATC models to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this combination treatment compared to single agent and vehicle control.<br \/>Results: Combination nitazoxanide and auranofin treatment synergistically inhibited cellular proliferation (p&#60;0.001) and inhibited colony formation and migration (p&#60;0.001) in ATC cell lines. We observed cellular oxidative stress with significant increase in ROS levels in the combination treatment group (p&#60;0.001). Nitazoxanide treatment alone and in combination with auranofin caused G1\/G0 arrest in cell cycle, induced autophagy (increased LC3BII expression) and later apoptosis. Auranofin treatment alone and in combination with nitazoxanide induced ferroptosis (decreased GPX4 expression and intracellular GSH\/GSSG ratios). RNA-Seq analysis, to identify biomarkers of response, showed &#62;7-fold increase in HMOX-1 (heme oxygenase 1) with combination treatment which was validated by western blot. Combination treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth as compared to single agents (p&#60;0.01) and had no significant treatment-related toxicity <i>in vivo<\/i>. Analysis of tumor samples showed significantly increased LC3BII expression by immunohistochemistry and reduced GPX4 mRNA expression (p&#60;0.0001) with combination treatment compared to control <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Conclusions: Combination nitazoxanide and auranofin treatment has synergistic anticancer activity in both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo <\/i>ATC models. The synergistic activity of the combination is due to enhanced G1\/G0 arrest, greater activation of autophagy, apoptosis and ferroptosis than single drug treatment.

So far, no predictive biomarkers are available for HPD early detection.<br \/>Methods: NSCLC patients treated with 1<sup>st <\/sup>line SA-ICI or PCT-ICI were assessed for HPD and circulating neutrophils. HPD was defined as delta tumor growth rate (TGR) &#62;50% and\/or TGR ratio &#8805;2. Circulating low density neutrophils (LDNs) were assessed by flow cytometry on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs). LDNs were defined as CD66b<sup>+<\/sup>CD15<sup>+<\/sup> cells among CD11b<sup>+<\/sup> PBMCs and immature subtypes as CD10<sup>- <\/sup>LDNs. The LDNs predictive role was assessed by penalized model-based tests.<br \/>Results: 144 NSCLC patients were included: 75 treated with SA-ICI, 69 with PCT-ICI. In the SA-ICI cohort, HPD occurred in 8 (11%) patients, while progressive disease (PD) and response or stable disease (PR\/SD) occurred in 33 (44%) and 34 (45%) of patients respectively. Immature circulating CD10<sup>- <\/sup>LDNs were significantly higher in baseline blood samples of HPD patients [median (ME): 39.3, interquartile range (IQR): 28.7] compared to PD [ME: 7.4, IQR: 14.9, p&#60;0.01] or PR\/SD patients [ME: 3.7, IQR: 12.6, p&#60;0.01]. Circulating CD10<sup>- <\/sup>LDNs were associated with HPD [odds ratio (OR): 1.17, 95% CI: 1.06; 1.29], with a good prediction capability [cross-validated AUC 0.97 (95%CI: 0.94;1.00)]. A 30.5% cut-off value for CD10<sup>- <\/sup>LDNs circulating neutrophils was identified by Younden index to discriminate HPD from others. In the PCT-ICI cohort, 14 patients had circulating CD10<sup>- <\/sup>LDNs &#8805;30.5%, being at high risk of HPD. However, no HPD was observed in PCT-ICI cohort and dynamic LDNs evaluation in high HPD risk patients showed 52.3% (IQR: 28.4) median reduction in CD10<sup>- <\/sup>LDNs upon PCT-ICI, versus only 8.9% (IQR: 34.6) reduction in HPD patients upon SA-ICI, suggesting that PCT prevents HPD by reducing selectively immature LDNs.<br \/>Conclusions: Baseline circulating immature neutrophils characterize HPD upon 1<sup>st<\/sup> line SA-ICI and a 30.5% cut-off of immature neutrophils could select NSCLC patients to be addressed to PCT-ICI combinations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Chemotherapy,Combination therapy,NSCLC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Roberto Ferrara<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Giuseppe Lo Russo<sup><\/sup>, Chiara Maura Ciniselli<sup><\/sup>, Annamaria Piva<sup><\/sup>, Barbara Bassani<sup><\/sup>, Elena Jachetti<sup><\/sup>, Giuseppina Calareso<sup><\/sup>, Valeria Duroni<sup><\/sup>, Settimio Di Gregorio<sup><\/sup>, Claudia Proto<sup><\/sup>, Arsela Prelaj<sup><\/sup>, Alessandro De Toma<sup><\/sup>, Mario Occhipinti<sup><\/sup>, Marta Brambilla<sup><\/sup>, Sara Manglaviti<sup><\/sup>, Laura Mazzeo<sup><\/sup>, Arturo Rinaldi<sup><\/sup>, Teresa Beninato<sup><\/sup>, Monica Ganzinelli<sup><\/sup>, Filippo De Braud<sup><\/sup>, Marina Chiara Garassino<sup><\/sup>, Paolo Verderio<sup><\/sup>, Mario Paolo Colombo<sup><\/sup>, Sabina Sangaletti<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"890488da-7889-4b26-a756-e9c8192be024","ControlNumber":"4296","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;R.

However, its resistance is frequently observed. In our initial combinatorial drug screening, OSU-03012 (AR-12) appeared as a promising drug to be combined with PARP inhibitor Olaparib in multiple ovarian cancer cell lines, regardless of <i>BRCA <\/i>mutation status. OSU-03012 is designed as an orphan drug with anti-microbial activity. It has also shown cell-context-dependent anti-cancer activity. Using imaging-based high-throughput drug sensitivity analysis, we found that OSU-03012 and BX-912, while both classified as 3-Phosphoinositide Dependent Protein Kinase 1 (PDK-1) inhibitors, not only differed in their synergistic effect together with Olaparib, also caused distinct phenotypic changes in ovarian cancer cells. Cell senescence was observed in BX-912 but not OSU-03012 treatment, alone or together with Olaparib. Recently, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) has been identified as a secondary target of OSU-03012, which explains its anti-cancer activity by regulating nucleotide metabolism and thus affecting DNA repair. However, in our study, OSU-03012 did not similarly affect cell viability and phenotype on ovarian cancer cell lines as a DHODH inhibitor BAY2402234. Interestingly, compared to BX-912 and BAY2402234, OSU-03012 showed higher selectivity on ovarian cancer cell lines over normal epithelial carrying <i>BRCA <\/i>and <i>TP53<\/i> mutations; it also exhibited reduced toxicity on a human fibroblast cell line. We are further clarifying the putative targets of OSU-03012 using thermal proteome profiling. To investigate the molecular evidence of OSU-03012 for treating ovarian cancer, we performed a differential gene expression analysis using Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database. All ovarian cancer cell lines included in GDSC drug screening are classified as Olaparib- or OSU-03012-sensitive\/insensitive, based on the respective IC50 threshold. We found that OSU-03012 sensitivity is positively associated with several known genes regulating ovarian cancer progression, such as <i>LUM <\/i>and<i> COL3A1, <\/i>as well as genes (e.g., <i>PTPRZ1<\/i>) that are associated with Olaparib insensitivity in this analysis. Interestingly, angiogenesis signatures were found to be enriched in both Olaparib and OSU-03012-sensitive cancer cell lines. We are currently establishing a cancer-vascular cell system in a microfluidic setting to study how such combinatorial drug treatment would connect to tumor microenvironment remodeling. Altogether, we identified a potential non-cancer drug for ovarian cancer treatment and to overcome Olaparib resistance. A multidisciplinary approach highlights the importance of drug target profiling and sensitivity signatures scoring to improve treatment stratification.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Proteomics,Microfluidics,Drug synergy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jie Bao<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Eva Daniela Mendoza Ortiz<sup>2<\/sup>, Jessica Agudelo<sup>3<\/sup>, Roman Filimonov<sup>3<\/sup>, Anniina Färkkilä<sup>1<\/sup>, Jing Tang<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland,<sup>2<\/sup>Institute of Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland,<sup>3<\/sup>Puissan Biotech Oy, Helsinki, Finland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2bfdfeff-805d-4d96-8eb7-f12bba68fe04","ControlNumber":"3539","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

PCa development and progression require androgen receptor (AR) signaling, which stimulates its downstream gene expressions and cancer progression. While second-generation anti-androgen drugs plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the first-line treatment for advanced prostate cancer patients, around one-third of patients will relapse in a short period. Advanced prostate cancer results in more mortalities than primary PCa patients. Evidence shows that the recurrence is caused by AR overexpression, AR variants, AR mutations, and signaling crosstalk. Thus, it is urgently needed to discover a novel therapeutic strategy for treating advanced prostate cancer. The heat shock protein family (HSP), including HSP90 and HSP70, play important roles in refolding aggregated protein for cancer cell proteomic equilibrium. HSP is induced primarily by heat shock factor (HSF1). As AR&#8217;s chaperone protein, HSP70 and HSP90 increase AR transcription activity. Inhibiting HSP70 and HSP90 promotes STUB1, an E3 ligase, binding to AR and AR - V7, and ubiquitination. Artesunate (ART) is a semi-synthetic ingredient from Artemisia annua and is the most common treatment for malaria throughout the world. It was approved for medical use by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) (Food and Drug Administration). Recently ART has been unveiled for its anticancer properties. However, the efficacy of ART treatment in advanced prostate cancer and the direct target of ART have not been investigated yet. Herein, we have examined the efficacy of combining Enzalutamide (Enza) and ART in advanced prostate cancer cell lines. We also performed unbiased bioinformatics analysis using RNA seq results in enzalutamide-resistant cell line C4-2R cells and 22RV1 cells to investigate the cell response toward ART treatment. We identified ART could downregulate of AR signaling pathway. Moreover, we determined that ART treatment induces AR degradation in proteasome dependent manner. Interestingly, we found HSP70 and HSP90 are also decreased in RNA seq results. Taking these together suggests that ART may target HSF1 directly. Our results suggest ART induced AR degradation could be a promising clinical strategy for advanced prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Androgen receptor,Heat shock proteins,Prostate cancer,Proteasome-mediated degradation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xinyi Wang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Fengyi Mao<sup><\/sup>, Jinghui Liu<sup><\/sup>, Yifan Kong<sup><\/sup>, Daheng He<sup><\/sup>, Chi Wang<sup><\/sup>, Zhiguo Li<sup><\/sup>, Xiaoqi Liu<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"21fe3217-8c01-4d96-86d8-854654338e70","ControlNumber":"3733","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>X.

The four-year event-free survival rate is only 37%. For patients with relapsed AT\/RT there are limited treatment options, but precision therapies may help improve survival for patients with this deadly disease. We have previously identified strong activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR (mTOR) signaling pathways in AT\/RT. Paxalisib is a highly brain-penetrant PI3K inhibitor acting upstream of mTOR. We find that Paxalisib slows tumor growth in orthotopic xenograft models of AT\/RT and extends median survival from 40 to 54 days (p=0.001, log-rank test). RNASeq after mTOR pathway inhibition identifies reflexive activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK (MAPK) pathway as a possible mechanism of therapy resistance (KEGG pathway analysis). The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK (MAPK) pathway plays a pivotal role in regulating cell growth and survival and activation of the pathway contributes to the aggressive growth of numerous cancers. Mirdametinib is a small, allosteric MEK inhibitor currently used in clinical trials for both pediatric low- and high-grade gliomas (PD0325901). We find that dual inhibition of both the mTOR and MAPK pathways by Paxalisib and Mirdametinib synergize to reduce AT\/RT growth and viability (Bliss synergy score 16.77). Paxalisib also combines with Mirdametinib to induce high levels of apoptosis and cell senescence (as determined by western blot: cPARP, pRB, P21, P16). Na&#239;ve treatments in mice bearing AT\/RT orthotopic tumors suggests the combination therapy decrease mTOR and MAPK pathway activation (as determined by western blot). These data support the use of Paxalisib and Mirdametinib combination therapy as a promising novel combination therapy to treat relapsed AT\/RT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"mTOR,Pediatric cancers,Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumor (AT\/RT),Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kristen  J.

Regorafenib is a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, it inhibits the activities of VEGFR2 and 3, Ret, Kit, PDGFR and Raf kinases and results in the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and cell proliferation. TAS102 or regorafenib monotherapy can lead to an overall survival benefit in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patient previously treated with conventional chemotherapy and target therapy (Arnold et al., 2018). TAS102 in combination with bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), is associated with a significant and clinically relevant improvement in progression-free survival in colorectal cancer (C-TASK FORCE)(Kuboki et al., 2017; Pfeiffer et al., 2020). FTD can synergize with nintedanib to inhibit the growth of colorectal cancer xenografts(Suzuki, Nakagawa, Matsuoka, &#38; Takechi, 2016). We previously reported that regorafenib combined with a fluoropyrimidine can delay disease progression in case reports of multidrug-resistant mCRC patients(Marks et al., 2015). Therefore, we hypothesized that the combination of TAS102 and regorafenib may be active in CRC and other gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, and may in the future provide a treatment option for patients with advanced GI cancer. We investigated the therapeutic effect of TAS102 in combination with regorafenib in preclinical studies employing cell culture, colonosphere assays that enrich for cancer stem cells, and in vivo. We found that TAS102 in combination with regorafenib has synergistic activity against multiple GI cancers in vitro including colorectal and gastric cancer, but not liver cancer cells. TAS102 inhibits colonosphere formation and this effect is potentiated by regorafenib. In vivo anti-tumor effects of TAS102 plus regorafenib appear to be due to anti-proliferative effects, necrosis and angiogenesis inhibition. Growth inhibition by TAS102 plus regorafenib occurs in xenografted tumors regardless of p53, KRAS or BRAF mutations, although more potent tumor suppression was observed with wild-type p53. Regorafenib significantly inhibits TAS102-induced angiogenesis and microvessel density in xenografted tumors, and inhibits TAS102-induced ERK1\/2 activation regardless of RAS or BRAF status in vivo. Collectively, TAS102 plus regorafenib is a<br \/>synergistic drug combination in preclinical models of GI cancer, with regorafenib suppressing TAS102-induced increase in microvessel density and p-ERK as contributing mechanisms. The drug combination may be further tested in gastric and other GI cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: colorectal,TAS102,Regorafenib,trifluridine\/tipiracil,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jun Zhang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Lanlan Zhou<sup><\/sup>, Shuai Zhao<sup><\/sup>, Wafik  S.

Wee1 and Myt1 kinases prevent premature entry into mitosis by monitoring the G2\/M checkpoint by adding an inhibitory phosphorylation on Cdk1. Wee1 is overexpressed in various tumors and MK-1775, a Wee1 small molecule inhibitor, is currently in phase I\/II cancer clinical trials. Although MK-1775 was shown to potentiate the effect of other genotoxic therapies, yet clinical resistance has emerged towards it. In examining the mechanism of MK-1775-mediated cytotoxicity, we identified Myt1 as a resistant factor. Emerging evidence suggests that Myt1 is an important cancer therapeutic target. Hence, we are examining a novel Myt1 kinase small molecule inhibitor, RP-6306 in combination with MK-1775 as a potential synthetic lethal cancer therapy. We hypothesize that a combination of MK-1775 and RP-6306, inhibitors against two partially redundant kinases important for adaptation to genotoxic stress, will achieve synthetic lethality while circumventing the issue of resistance development following monotherapies.<br \/>Model Systems Used: 1) a cervical cancer cell line that is tetracycline inducible for Myt1 expression; 2) cancer cell lines (breast and cervical) that are resistant to MK-1775 through upregulation of Myt1.<br \/>Methods: We established the IC50 of RP-6306 in a panel of tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cell lines using standard crystal violet viability assay. Following that, we tested the combination effect of MK-1775 and RP-6306 in model cell lines listed above using zero potency model of synergy. The effect of the combination treatment on the clonogenicity was evaluated using clonogenic assay. Timelapse microscopy on a High Content Imaging system was used to determine the effect of RP-6306 and MK-1775 on mitotic duration and cell fates.<br \/>Results: We found that MK-1775 and RP-6306 combination treatment shows synergistic cell killing in a panel of cancer cell lines. Wee1 inhibition shows synergistic cell killing with Myt1 inhibition especially in inducible Myt1 overexpressing cells. Wee1 and Myt1 combined inhibition resists the increase in clonogenic potential of the cancer cells transiently overexpressing Myt1. RP-6306 and MK-1775 combination treatment promotes mitotic arrest leading to cell death in Myt1 overexpressing cells. We also found that the mechanism of cell death in the cells treated with the combination treatment is centromere fragmentation leading to mitotic catastrophe.<br \/>Conclusions: The combined Wee1 and Myt1 inhibition leads to synthetic lethality. Hence, our findings strongly suggest that the combined MK-1775 and RP-6306 treatment has promising potential to mitigate MK-1775 resistance. Our research contributes to the development of novel potential combination therapy while optimizing and improving the efficacy of MK-1775 treatment for potential clinical use.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synthetic lethality,PKMYT1,WEE1,Cell cycle checkpoints,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sargun Sokhi<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Joanne  D.

Although patients with HGSOC are likely to respond to treatment, it is common for the cancer to recur and become resistant to treatment, therefore there is a need to develop new targets and novel combinations to increase patient survival rates. ATRi&#8217;s (Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related inhibitors) have shown efficacy in HGSOC. Considering ATRi&#8217;s have shown moderate efficacy as a single treatment in HGSOC patients, we hypothesized that combining ATRi&#8217;s with ONC201 would enhance efficacy. ONC201 is a pro-apoptotic TRAIL-inducing compound that activates the integrated stress response and inactivates the Akt pathway which is upregulated in over 70% of HGSOC. Inactivation of the Akt pathway may result in a synergistic effect that could be translated for use in patients with HGSOC. Three HGSOC cell lines were treated with the novel drug combination of ceralasertib (ATRi) and ONC201 and CellTiterGLO viability assays were performed after 72 hours to evaluate the synergistic effect of combination treatment. Western blots were performed to investigate the synergistic effect of combination treatment on the Akt pathway as well as expression of the cellular metabolic stress protein ATF4. Cytokine profiling using the Luminex 200 technology was performed to study treatment-induced changes in the tumor microenvironment. Cell viability after ceralasertib and ONC201 combination treatment showed synergy in HGSOC cell lines (OVCAR3, KURAMOCHI, TOV21G) . In TOV21G cell line, combination studies of ONC201 and ceralasertib calculated by compusyn software demonstrated a synergistic effect of both drugs, Combination indexes below one were observed at concentration of 0.008-2 &#956;M of ceralasertib with 0.31-5 &#956;M of ONC201 with the best combination index of 0.65. We similarly observed synergy in the two other cell line between ONC201 and ceralasertib. Western blotting showed reduction in total Akt and Erk expression and an increase in ATF4, consistent with the observed synergetic effect of ceralasertib and ONC201 combination. Our ongoing studies are exploring potential mechanisms of synergy between ceralasertib and ONC201 and effects on immune&#8211;mediated killing of HGSOC cells. Our results suggest a rational and potentially effective novel therapy combination of ATRi ceralasertib and ONC201 that maybe further developed for HGSOC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Imipridone,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maryam Ghandali<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kadir Mert Selvi<sup>2<\/sup>, Kelsey  E.
