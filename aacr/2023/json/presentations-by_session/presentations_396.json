[{"Abstract":"Background: Integrins are cell adhesion receptors consisting of 18&#945; and 8&#946; subunits. A subset of integrins (&#945;v&#946;3) recognizes Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide motifs which are involved in the neovascularization and progression of various cancers. The aim of the study was to investigate if &#945;v&#946;3 can serve as a molecular target for the treatment of thyroid cancer (TC) with a novel radiolabeled RGD analog <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-EB-RGD.<br \/>Methods: Integrin &#945;v&#946;3 mRNA and\/or protein expression was evaluated in 496 TC included in The Cancer Genome Atlas, tissue microarray including 70 TC and 10 normal thyroid samples, and 14 TC cell lines. <i>BRAF<\/i>-like or <i>RAS<\/i>-like expression profile was determined through standard BRS scores ranging from -1 to 0 for <i>BRAF<\/i>-like and 0 to 1 for <i>RAS<\/i>-like TC. The association between BRS and the &#945;v&#946;3 expression was tested by the Spearman correlation (r). Nude mice xenografts developing &#945;v&#946;3 expressing TC after subcutaneous injection of 5*10^6 TC cells were subjected to monotherapy with 0.5 mCi <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-EB-RGD (<sup>177<\/sup>Lu) or in combination with Lenvatinib (<sup>177<\/sup>Lu+L). The therapeutic efficacy of <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-EB-RGD was compared with standard-of-care Lenvatinib alone (L) and placebo (P). The continuous data were presented as medians with [25-75% interquartile ranges] and compared using Kruskal-Wallis test. The mixed-effects models were used for longitudinal data analysis with adjusted p&#8804; 0.05 considered statistically significant.<br \/>Results: We found a moderate negative correlation between BRS and &#945;v (r=-0.5, p&#60;0.001), and &#946;3 (r=-0.27, p&#60;0.001), revealing that <i>BRAF<\/i>-like tumors have a higher mRNA expression of &#945;v&#946;3 integrins. Consistently, the highest &#945;v&#946;3 mRNA and\/or protein expression was found in the <i>BRAF<\/i>-like TC cell lines OCUT2 (BRS=-0.56), TPC1 (BRS=-0.4), K1 (BRS=-0.29), and Hurthle TC cell line XTC1 (BRS=-0.46). The immunostaining revealed a higher &#945;v&#946;3 expression in papillary TC compared with follicular TC (p=0.002), and in normal thyroid (p&#60;0.001). Poorly differentiated TC had a similar &#945;v&#946;3 expression to papillary TC (p=0.14). In the thyroid cancer xenograft mouse model, all treatment modalities were more effective than the placebo in decreasing tumor size as early as 5 days after therapy initiation. A significant difference in growth curve and tumor volume was maintained at the study endpoint (L 0.584 cm<sup>3<\/sup> [0.196-0.984] vs P 0.911 cm<sup>3<\/sup> [0.183-1.68], p=0.001; <sup>177<\/sup>Lu 0.259 cm<sup>3 <\/sup>[0.103-0.376] vs P, p&#60;0.001; and <sup>177<\/sup>Lu+L 0.274 cm<sup>3<\/sup> [0.108-0.406] vs P, p&#60;0.001). The combination therapy (<sup>177<\/sup>Lu+L) resulted in decreased tumor volume as compared with monotherapy with Lenvatinib (p=0.05) but had a similar effect as compared with <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-EB-RGD monotherapy (p=0.99).<br \/>Conclusions: The radiolabeled &#945;v&#946;3 analog <sup>177<\/sup>Lu-EB-RGD has potent growth inhibitory effects in TC characterized by a high integrins expression.

DDX5 is a founding member of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family and known as a non-processive RNA helicase. It acts as a transcriptional co-activator of many cancer-associated genes, such as <i>MYC,<\/i> however, the underlying molecular mechanism is unknown. <i>MYC<\/i> is one of the most critical oncogenes and has a DNA G-quadruplex in its proximal promoter region (MycG4) that functions as transcriptional silencer. Guanine-rich DNA and RNA sequences can form G-quadruplex, a non-canonical secondary structure. However, MycG4 is highly stable and its regulatory role in transcription requires active unfolding. Here, we report that DDX5 unfolds MycG4 with extreme efficiency, and thereby transactivates <i>MYC<\/i> expression. To understand the effects of DDX5 on MycG4, we characterized the unfolding of MycG4-DNA within the DDX5-MycG4 complex using DNA footprinting, FRET and CD spectroscopy. While DDX5 is known as a dsRNA helicase, our results showed that DDX5 is a highly active DNA G4-resolvase. Strikingly, MycG4 unfolding requires neither ATP hydrolysis nor extended loading of single-stranded flanking. Our protein-binding-ELISA experiments revealed specific and high-affinity binding of DDX5 to G4 structures regardless of whether the substrate is DNA or RNA. To elucidate the cellular functions of DDX5, we analyzed publicly available DDX5 ChIP-seq data and identified G-rich sequences in cancer cells as chromatin binding sites of DDX5. Moreover, our ChIP and Western Blot results showed that DDX5 is enriched at the <i>MYC<\/i> promoter and activates <i>MYC<\/i> transcription. Importantly, G-quadruplex interactive small molecules can inhibit the DDX5 interaction with the promoter MycG4 and DDX5-mediated transcriptional activation of the <i>MYC<\/i> gene. In addition, knock-down of DDX5 expression with DDX5-specific siRNA in cancer cells resulted in downregulation of <i>MYC<\/i> expression and sensitization to G4-interactive small molecules. In summary, we identified resolving DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes as novel function of DDX5. Our results establish that the <i>MYC<\/i>-transactivation by DDX5 is mediated through unfolding of the <i>MYC<\/i> promoter quadruplex and thereby establish a new molecular target to suppress <i>MYC<\/i> for cancer intervention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Molecular targets,DDX5,G-quadruplex,MYC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Guanhui Wu<sup><\/sup>, Zheng Xing<sup><\/sup>, <b>Luying Chen<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Elizabeth J.

CYR61-specific functions are dependent on cellular context. In prostate cancer (PCa), CYR61 contributes to cell growth and survival through its interactions with extracellular ligands, such as integrins avb3 and a6b4, in the extracellular matrix space. Interestingly, CYR61 contains an insulin-like growth factor-binding protein domain suggesting that it may interact with insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1). High serum levels of IGF-1 are directly linked to PCa development and recently have been studied as a predictor of metastatic disease. Given the important roles that IGF-1 and CYR61 play in PCa and their potential interaction, it is critical to investigate their molecular interplay. This study is designated to specifically determine and characterize the molecular interaction between CYR61 and IGF-1 in metastatic PCa and to determine if this interaction contributes to aggressive tumor properties (e.g., proliferation, tumorsphere formation). Using immunoblotting, we demonstrated that CYR61 is upregulated in the metastatic cell line PC3 and downregulated in the docetaxel-resistant cell line PC3-DR. Furthermore, optimized knockdown of CYR61 using siRNA significantly reduced PC3 cell proliferation, viability, and prostasphere formation. To examine the underlying mechanisms associated with IGF-1 signaling, we assessed the activation of either the PI3\/Akt and MAPK pathways in PC3 cells with CYR61 silencing. CYR61 siRNA-mediated knockdown decreased activation of the PI3\/Akt pathway but did not affect the MAPK pathway. We also initiated studies to determine the co-localization of CYR61 and IGF-1 using immunofluorescence microscopy (IF). Based on the initial IF observations, we will proceed to examine if their interaction is primarily intra- or extra-cellular. For intracellular interactions, we will co-immunoprecipitate CYR61 with IGF-1 and for extracellular interactions, we will use the AVidity-based EXtracellular Interaction Screen (AVEXIS) system. Our goal is to establish the contribution of CYR61-IGF1 protein-protein interaction to PCa cell proliferation. Specifically, the correlation between PCa aggressiveness and circulating levels of CYR61 and IGF-1 is poorly studied. Their combined role may explain a proportion of aggressive PCa.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1),Metastasis,Proliferation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Greisha L.

Up to 69% of NSCLC are mutated for the tumor suppressor gene <i>TP<\/i><i>53<\/i><i>, <\/i>and of these, 84% are missense mutations, where wild-type (WT) <i>TP53<\/i> tumor suppressor function is lost and in most cases, emergent cancer-promoting oncogenic activities are acquired. Due to the poor draggability of mutated p53 protein, the focus of therapeutics targeting NSCLC tumors with oncogenic missense mutant p53 has been on vulnerabilities that are not present in normal cells expressing WT p53. One such vulnerability involves oncogenic mutant p53-dependent attenuation of the oxidative stress response. The ability of cancer cells to survive oxidative stress depends on the regulated synthesis and activity of cellular antioxidants, including glutathione (GSH). Proteasome inhibitors (PIs) are known to induce cellular stress at multiple levels, including proteotoxic, autophagic, and oxidative stress, but the clinical utility of PIs has been limited by lack of efficacy in patients with solid tumors, including unselected lung cancer patients.<br \/>Methods and Results: We now show bortezomib (BTZ) and other PIs are preferentially cytotoxic in oncogenic mutant p53-expressing lung cancer cells in culture. Furthermore, BTZ-treated oncogenic mutant p53-expressing cells display elevated levels of reactive oxygen species and BTZ&#8217;s cytotoxic effects were rescued by antioxidants such as N-acetyl cysteine, indicating that oxidative stress is the critical driver of BTZ cytotoxicity. Upon BTZ treatment of oncogenic mutant p53-expressing NSCLC cells, but not in WT p53 expressing NSCLC cells, we also observed the transcriptional induction of pro-apoptotic BH3-only BCL-2 family protein NOXA, consistent with an apoptotic mechanism of BTZ-induced cell death. Furthermore, in combination with BTZ, the use of BH3-mimetics such as venetoclax (ABT-199) or navitoclax (ABT-263) to inhibit the function of pro-survival proteins BCL-2\/BCL-X<sub>L<\/sub> synergistically enhanced BTZ cytotoxicity, but only in oncogenic mutant p53-expressing NSCLC cells. <i>I<\/i><i>n vivo<\/i> mouse xenograft studies demonstrated that combination treatments of BTZ + venetoclax or BTZ + carboplatin (a standard of care chemotherapy for NSCLC) significantly attenuated oncogenic mutant p53-expressing tumor growth.<br \/>Conclusions: Our data suggest that the preferential cytotoxicity of BTZ, and potentially other PIs, in oncogenic mutant p53-expressing NSCLC cells depends on the induction of toxic oxidative stress leading to NOXA-dependent apoptosis. Thus, combining PIs with drugs that limit antioxidant responses and\/or sensitize cells to NOXA-induced apoptosis (e.g., BH3-mimetics) should synergistically and selectively kill NSCLC cells expressing oncogenic mutant p53 and open novel therapeutic avenues for the treatment of NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,p53,Proteasome Inhibitors,Venetoclax,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Kranthi Kumar Chougoni<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Victoria  L.

However, most approaches are limited to the interrogation of non-essential factors and identify gene networks rather than direct target structures. Inspired from work in the nematode <i>C. elegans,<\/i> we perform forward genetic screens based on chemical mutagenesis. This approach randomly introduces single nucleotide variants into the entire genome resulting in cell populations which carry substitutions in statistically more than 90% of all amino acids. Challenging such mutagenized cell populations with a drug candidate of interest, followed by next generation sequencing and analysis, reveals drug resistance mechanism, direct drug target interactions, and potential concealed efficacies. The alteration of single amino acids thereby allows interrogation of non-essential as well as most essential factors and increases screening resolution to the amino acid level. From such screens we inferred and tested a novel treatment option for glioblastoma multiforme. The natural compound Artemisinin and its derivative Artesunate are widely used anti-malarial drugs. Based on theircytotoxic activity, they are also tested as anti-cancer therapies, while the definite mechanism of action and critical host cell targets have remained largely elusive. Using forward genetic screening approaches, we demonstrate that porphyrin biosynthesis governs Artemisinin&#8217;s cytotoxicity. Genetic or pharmacological modulation of porphyrin production is sufficient to alter Artemisinin cytotoxicity in multiple eukaryotic cells, including human cancer cells. Combining Artesunate with 5-ALA treatment we translated the screening results to clinically relevant model systems of brain tumor development, such as glioblastomas in engineered cerebral organoids, patient-derived brain tumor spheroids, and orthotopic xenograft models. 5-ALA is a clinically approved photodynamic porphyrin enhancer and surgical fluorescence marker, which specifically marks tumorigenic brain areas. With this additional level of selectivity, we demonstrate a strong antineoplastic effect of the 5-ALA-Artesunatecombination in all tested model systems. These findings extend to the triple combination with temozolomide and urgently await further testing in clinical setups.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Molecular targets,Screening,Small molecule drugs,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Michael Orthofer<sup>1<\/sup>, Jasmin Taubenschmid-Stowers<sup>2<\/sup>, Marianna Rozsova<sup>1<\/sup>, Anna Laemmerer<sup>3<\/sup>, Daniela Loetsch<sup>3<\/sup>, Johannes Gojo<sup>3<\/sup>, Andreas Peyrl<sup>3<\/sup>, Walter Berger<sup>3<\/sup>, Ullrich Elling<sup>4<\/sup>, <b>Moritz Horn<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Josef  M.

While there are currently a number of MDM2 inhibitors in clinical trials, we found no pure MDM4\/MDMX inhibitors under clinical investigation. Because hormone-resistant cancers pose a significant challenge for clinical intervention, the identification of translatable novel therapeutic targets remains an important goal. Analysis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) reveals overexpression of p53 negative regulator MDM4\/MDMX as a frequent alteration in these cancers. There is an urgent need to study and target MDM4\/MDMX in cancer therapy and this may ultimately include dual MDM2 and MDM4\/MDMX inhibitors. However, it is clear that MDM4\/MDMX is a primary oncogenic driver that requires specific therapeutic targeting. As metastasis is often observed clinically in patients diagnosed with breast and prostate cancer, we sought to expand our understanding of the metastasis reduction potential of a previously described preclinical MDM4\/MDMX inhibitor, a 4-nitrobenzofuroxan derivative, XI-006 (NSC207895). In a scratch assay using breast and prostate cancer cell lines, increasing doses of XI-006 decreased tumor cell migration in a time and dose-dependent manner, demonstrating the benefit of MDMX inhibition in preventing the induction of tumor cell migration. The exact mechanism of this result remains unclear, and further investigation is needed to elucidate the impact of XI-006 on TNBC and CRPC cell proliferation and migration. Our future directions include identifying the synergistic potential of combining MDM4\/MDMX inhibitor XI-006 with other cancer therapies, assessing the impact of XI-006 on immune responses in co-culture studies, and testing therapeutic efficacy <i>in vivo<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mdmx,Breast cancer,Prostate cancer,Migration,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Arielle De La Cruz<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Andrew George<sup>1<\/sup>, Payton De La Cruz<sup>1<\/sup>, Maximilian  P.

We tried to find novel prognostic biomarkers with multi-omics analysis of our primary pancreatic cancer cell lines.<br \/>Methods: In this study, we selected pancreatic cancer prognostic markers using established CRCs and FFPE samples and validated the molecular mechanism of LXN. As the first step, we performed both transcriptome and proteome analysis using RNA sequencing and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC\/MS-MS) with 6 primary pancreatic cancer cell lines established by CRC. After analysis, we mined several candidate markers of prognosis including latexin (LXN) and sialic acid acetylesterease (SIAE). And we validated these markers clinicopathologically using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of 136 tissues from a different set of pancreatic cancer patients. And we confirmed the knock-down effect of LXN using siLXN in pancreatic cancer cells.<br \/>Results: We selected 2 highly prognostic markers with LXN and SIAE after transcriptome and proteome analysis. In these genes, high LXN expression group showed longer median overall survival (OS) than low expression group, respectively (14.8 vs. 10.4 months, <i>P<\/i>-value=0.28), respectively. For the evaluation of IHC, we established 3D organoid model using CRCs and confirmed the correlation between mRNA expression and protein expression with western blotting and IHC. The expression of Akt\/mTOR was decreased after siLXN treatment compared to control groups. In order to validation as a prognostic marker, we stained formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slide from 136 pancreatic cancer patients. After IHC analysis, LXN high group (H-score &#62; 12) showed significantly longer OS than low LXN group (52 vs. 28 months, <i>P<\/i>-value = 0.043).<br \/>Conclusion: In this study, we found LXN as a prognostic marker with inhibition of proliferation utilizing patient-derived cancer model and FFPE samples.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Multiomics,Latexin,Patient-derived cancer model,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chan Hee Park<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Hee Seung Lee<sup><\/sup>, Jin Su Kim<sup><\/sup>, Yoo Keung Tae<sup><\/sup>, Jin Young Lee<sup><\/sup>, Seungmin Bang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d56affbe-60ec-4dc7-a1e0-68dab4acea1b","ControlNumber":"4206","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

Among their primary use as anxiolytics and sedatives, the 1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives and their metabolites play a role as antitumor, antithrombotic, antiviral and antimalarial agents. Recent studies revealed the influence of the benzodiazepine derivatives on microtubule assembly or stability with subsequent mitotic failure. These microtubule-targeting effects were evaluated in novel benzodiazepine derivatives. The antiproliferative activities of novel derivatives were tested against a panel of 10 cancer cell lines and 2 non-cancer cell lines. The compounds with IC50&#60;10 &#181;M were further analyzed for the cell cycle. Flow cytometry and fluorescent cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) assays were performed to evaluate the effects of derivatives on the cell cycle phases. The immunofluorescence alpha-tubulin assay and tubulin polymerization assay were accomplished to detect the changes in the mitosis. Implementation of molecular docking revealed the specific binding site of the derivatives. All tested derivatives reveal the G2\/M block in the cell cycle and 3 of them were identified as M-phase blockers. The immunofluorescence alpha-tubulin assay detected the disruption of the cellular microtubule network, and the tubulin polymerization assay uncovered the potential of the tested compounds to inhibit tubulin polymerization. Molecular docking confirms that benzodiazepine derivatives fit the colchicine site best and are partially overlaid with the native colchicine binding pose. This suggests that these compounds may adapt to the tubulin binding site in a conformation induced by colchicine The inhibition of tubulin polymerization by novel derivatives is one of their possible mechanisms of action on antiproliferative effect on cancer cell lines. More rigorous studies will be performed further to establish pose stability and explain structure-activity relationships.

In this study we employed RNA sequencing to discover the transcriptional profile of SCOS in order to find a specific gene signatures useful to find new potential therapeutic targets. To date, the tumor is treated according to the osteosarcoma protocols.<br \/><b>Material and Methods:<\/b><i> <\/i>We studied 15 primary tumor including 6 SCOS and 9 high grade Osteosarcoma (OS) by RNASeq . Pair-end libraries were synthesized using TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit for Enrichment and loaded on NextSeq 500 platform (Illumina). After FastqQC quality control, fastq data were aligned to Homo_sapiens GRCh38 with STAR algorithm and counted by featureCounts. In Addition we randomly selected 30 muscle-skeletal normal tissues from 800 available samples from Genotype-Tissue Expression repository (GTEX). Using surrogate variables to remove batch effects and other unwanted variations, we performed differentially expression analysis employing DESeq2 (R package). We considered as differentially expressed genes those BH adj p-value &#60;0.01 and absolute |log<sub>2<\/sub>FC|=2. We then performed preranked Gene set Enrichment analysis (GSEA) for biological function assessment<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>To elucidate the transcriptome landscape of SCOS we first performed differential gene expression analysis between SCOS and normal tissue identifying 5061 deregulated genes (2516 up-regulated and 2545 down-regulated in SCOS). Then, from this signature we filtered out the signature differentially expressed between OS and normal tissue, obtaining a specific SCOS signature of 1371 genes (1013 up-regulated and 358 down-regulated). To study the biological function behind SCOS we performed GSEA and we found that SCOS gene signature resulted enriched in epigenetics mechanisms as well as in embryonic stem cell (ES) gene sets. In particular, we found the overexpression of <i>EZH2, ASXL1, HDAC9, MYCN, MYB<\/i> genes involved in Polycomb group complex. This on one side confirms the highly undifferentiated nature of this tumor that could explain the more aggressive behaviour of SCOS in comparison to OS; on the other side, offers in epigenetic drugs a new therapeutic perspective.

Cumulative evidence has suggested that defects in the UPS machinery are involved in the pathogenesis of human diseases, including cancer. The proteasome-associated polyubiquitin receptor ADRM1 (also known as Rpn13) orchestrates the process of substrate recruitment with deubiquitination in the proteasome through its N-terminal ubiquitin-binding domain and C-terminal activation of deubiquitinating enzyme. Using long-read SMRT-seq to profile the RNA splicing landscape in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we previously reported on an unannotated alternative spliced variant of ADRM1 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (<i>Hepatology 2019<\/i>). This novel isoform exhibits an exon 9 skipping (ADRM1-&#916;Ex9) that resulted in an altered C-terminus of the protein. In this study, we undertook further investigations to characterize the detailed functional effects of ADRM1-&#916;Ex9 in HCC biology and the underlying mechanism. Initial study by junction-specific Taqman PCR assay showed that ADRM1-&#916;Ex9 is more frequently upregulated in HCC tumors than the canonical full-length counterpart (ADRM1-FL). There is an interchange between the two isoforms as tumor develops which underscores an isoform-switch in favor of HCC development. Indeed, our result showed that ADRM1-&#916;Ex9, but not ADRM1-FL, correlated significantly with inferior patient survival. Functionally, ADRM1-&#916;Ex9 knockdown profoundly suppressed proliferation by inducing spontaneous apoptosis in HCC cell lines and patient-derived HCC organoids. The corresponding effects were less apparent from ADRM1-FL knockdown. Consistently, overexpression of ADRM1-&#916;Ex9 in normal human liver organoids promoted pre-malignant features alongside increased in-vitro propagation time. Ubiquitin Proteome profiling revealed that ADRM1-&#916;Ex9 led to a reduced expression of the pivotal tumor suppressor p53. A parallel transcriptome also substantiated that ADRM1-&#916;Ex9 modulated genes involved in the p53 and apoptosis pathways. Collectively, our study demonstrated that the non-canonical spliced isoform ADRM1-&#916;Ex9 confers growth and pro-survival advantages in HCC through mediating selective degradation of tumor suppressor p53 protein.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Alternative splicing,ADRM1,ubiquitination,P53,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yanmei Sun<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Mingjing Xu<sup><\/sup>, Ho Lee Wan<sup><\/sup>, Alissa  M.

Prognosis for EAC remains poor even with modern combination therapies due to high resistance to chemotherapy. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches for EAC treatment improvements are urgently needed. Hypoxia or insufficient tissue oxygenation contributes to cancer aggressiveness and poor clinical prognosis. Overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and immunosuppressive CD73, an ecto-5&#8217;-nucleotidase enzyme in cancer can give rise to tumor progression with drug resistance. CD73 has never been proposed as a therapeutic target in EAC and its relationship with hypoxia or HIF-1 alpha has not also been investigated in EAC. In this study, we therefore investigated the therapeutic targeting of HIF-1 alpha and CD73 by acriflavine in experimental EAC.<br \/>Methods: Hypoxia in EAC cells were induced by 3D culture and hypoxic exposure. NanoCulture&#174; plates and dishes were used for 3D cultures. For hypoxic exposure, cells were placed in a sealed modular incubator chamber flushed with a gas mixture containing 1% O2, 5% CO2 and 94% N2. Hypoxic status was detected by adding hypoxia probe LOX-1 and fluorescent microscopy. Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (NPT) was used as chemotherapeutic agent, whereas acriflavine was used as hypoxia-targeting agent. In vitro cell growth was detected by WST-1 and Cell Titer-Glo (CTG) luminescent assays, in vivo tumor growth was detected by measuring subcutaneous xenografts, apoptosis was detected by cleaved caspase 3\/PARP expressions and hypoxia-targeting was detected by HIF-1 alpha\/CD73 expressions.<br \/>Results: We observed overexpression of both HIF-1 alpha and CD73 in 3D culture and hypoxic exposure of EAC cells. Interestingly acriflavine treatment drastically inhibited both HIF-1 alpha and CD73 expression in EAC 3D culture and hypoxic exposure. 3D culture was more resistant to antiproliferative effect of chemotherapeutic agent NPT over 2D monolayer culture. Contrary to that, hypoxia-targeting agent acriflavine showed stronger antiproliferative effects in 3D culture than in 2D culture. We also observed hypoxia inside the 3D culture spheroids. In addition, acriflavine showed significant in vivo antitumor efficacy both as monotherapy and in combination with NPT. In subcutaneous xenografts using OE19 EAC cells, acriflavine monotherapy exhibited a significant decrease in relative tumor volume to 55.02% compared to control (p=0.04) and addition of NPT with acriflavine also showed a significant enhancement effect of tumor regression as tumor size decreased to 32.70% compared to control (p=0.002).<br \/>Conclusion: These results support the potential of acriflavine as HIF-1 alpha and CD73 targeting and its combination with chemotherapy NPT as an effective option for EAC therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Hypoxia-inducible factor,CD73,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Md Sazzad Hassan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Aktar Ali<sup>2<\/sup>, Saisantosh Ponna<sup>3<\/sup>, Dimitri Scofield<sup>4<\/sup>, Niranjan Awasthi<sup>1<\/sup>, Mark Jantz<sup>5<\/sup>, Urs von Holzen<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine - South Bend, South Bend, IN,<sup>2<\/sup>Warren Family Center for Drug Discovery, University of Notre Dame, South Bend, IN,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Chemistry, University of Notre Dame, South Bend, IN,<sup>4<\/sup>Indiana University (South Bend, IN), South Bend, IN,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Biology, University of Notre Dame, South Bend, IN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cebf4593-7044-4d46-b7ff-a76133e04502","ControlNumber":"4603","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Recently, our laboratory and other groups described long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as new drivers of TNBC progression, which represent an exciting new avenue for targeted treatments. LncRNAs are the most versatile and diverse class of non-coding RNAs with roles in the progression of TNBC development, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, metastasis and drug resistance. LncRNAs have greater tissue-specific expression compared to proteins and can be targeted using nucleotide sequence-specific RNA therapeutics, leading to reduced systemic toxicities when used as a cancer target. Using a combined approach of computational analysis of patient data and CRISPR functional screening, we identified hundreds of lncRNAs as novel drivers of TNBC. We prioritized one lncRNA target (<i>lncTNBC3<\/i>) with high translational potential. <i>LncTNBC3 <\/i>knockdown lead to reduced TNBC cell proliferation in two different loss-of-function models. To gain initial insights into the mechanism via which <i>lncTNBC3 <\/i>functions, RNA sequencing was carried out on knockdown cells, revealing that <i>lncTNBC3 <\/i>impacts cell cycle and DNA repair pathways.

HER4 is a tyrosine kinase receptor belonging to the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER\/ErbB) family. The role of HER4 in cancer has not been fully studied, potentially due to its complex biology (four isoforms, different stability\/tissue-specific expression patterns, and oncogenic\/tumor suppressor roles). Using computational analysis, we identified two potentially oncogenic HER4 mutations in melanoma (HER4 R106C and R711C). We then developed CRISPR\/Cas9-modified selection-free melanoma cell lines for interrogating the role of these mutations as biomarkers of response to the oral, irreversible pan-HER (EGFR, HER2, HER4) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) neratinib (NER).<br \/>Methods: Two melanoma cell lines (WM115, SKMEL24) were genome-edited by using a selection-free CRISPR\/Cas9 approach. Single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed by using the CRISPRon (v1.0) web tool, and Homology Directed Repair (HDR) single-stranded OligoDeoxyriboNucleotides (ssODNs), containing the HER4 mutations, were designed with the SnapGene Software (v6.1.1). The RNP complex (Cas9 and sgRNAs) and the HDR_ssODNs, for each HER4 mutation, were delivered into the melanoma cells through electroporation. Upon validation of the CRISPR\/Cas9-efficiency via PCR and Sanger Sequencing, the CRISPR\/Cas9-modified cells were single-cell sorted via FACS, by using two singlets gating (FSC-A\/FSC-H and SSC-A\/SSC-H) and a live\/dead (propidium iodide) gating, to perform single-cell cloning. Colonies were then amplified and screened via PCR and Sanger sequencing to isolate pure selection-free HER4 CRISPR\/Cas9 knock-ins clones of melanoma cells.<br \/>Results: The WM115 and SKMEL24 melanoma cell lines were found to be wild-type for the HER4 receptor in the Depmap Portal (mutation 22Q2, 2022 data release 2). R106C and R711C CRISPR\/Cas9 knock-ins were created in the melanoma cell lines three days after the electroporation of the CRISPR\/Cas9 complex. The efficiency of the HER4 R106C CRISPR\/Cas9 knock-in was 22% and 7% in the SKMEL24 and WM115 melanoma cells, respectively, with a respective total indel percentage of 76% (SKMEL24) and 55% (WM115). The HER4 R711C CRISPR\/Cas9 knock-in efficiency was 15% in the SKMEL24 (with 26% total indels) and 1% in the WM115 (with 33% total indels). Single-cell colonies of the HER4 CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated knock-ins (HER4 R106C and R711C), were formed at four days (SKMEL24) and at one week (WM115) after single-cell sorting.<br \/>Conclusions: CRISPR\/Cas9 technology can be utilised to introduce single-point mutations in HER4 to melanoma cell lines. <i>In vitro<\/i> functional characterisation of the isolated HER4 CRISPR\/Cas9-edited melanoma cell lines will be performed in order to understand the activating potential of HER4 R106C and R711C and their sensitivity to NER.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,HER4\/HER4 mutations,CRISPR\/Cas9 selection-free knock-ins,Neratinib,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Marta Valenti<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yonglun Luo<sup>2<\/sup>, Neil  T.

Thus, this study examined changes in the proteome of epithelial cells in pancreatic cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine, to identify new therapeutic targets.<br \/>Methods: Upon receiving patient consent, fresh pancreatic cancer tissue was received from surgical tumor resections at the University Hospital of Bonn. We mechanically and enzymatically digested and purified the tissue to create single-cell suspensions. After staining the cells against CD45 und CD326, we purified epithelial cells, blood cells, and stroma through FACS. To analyze their proteome, the sorted cells were lysed in TEAB buffer and the protein lysates were measured by the mass spectrometry core facility at the University of Bonn. We then analyzed the data using DAVID and Shiny GO.<br \/>Results: Gene enrichment analyses showed a significantly reduced expression of calreticulin after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in epithelial cells. A direct comparison between untreated and treated epithelium cancer cells using a heat map showed a decreased expression of actin and enzymes of glycolysis in treated cancer cells. Moreover, untreated epithelial cells showed an increase of proteins related to MHC class Ib protein complex assembly and antigen processing and presentation of endogenous peptide antigen via MHC class. In contrast, treated cells showed a higher presence of proteins for nutrient supply from the blood. Furthermore, untreated stroma cells exhibited an increased number of proteins responsible for mesenchymal migration and for actin filament fragmentation.<br \/>Conclusion: This study shows that neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine leads to distinct changes in the proteome of tumor cells in pancreatic cancers. In particular, a decreased expression of the &#8220;eat-me-signal&#8221; calreticulin impairs macrophage-mediated cancer cell phagocytosis, thereby indicating a mechanism by which cancer cells protect themselves after chemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreas,Gemcitabine,Mass spectrometry,Proteomic analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Michael  C.

The 5-year survival rate for EAC patients is less than 20% which underscores the need to better understand the underlying mechanisms to identify new therapeutic approaches. This study aimed at investigating the potential role of APE1 in regulating SMAD3 and promoting EAC progression.<br \/>Methods and Results: Western blot data showed that APE1 and SMAD3 were highly expressed in EAC cell lines. APE1 silencing reduced SMAD3 nuclear expression and downregulated its downstream targets SERPINE1 and c-myc. These results were confirmed by immunofluorescence staining showing loss of nuclear accumulation of SMAD3 after APE1 knockdown. Mechanistically, immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays revealed a direct binding between APE1 and SMAD3 in the nucleus. Further investigation showed that APE1 binds to the C-terminal MH2 domain of SMAD3, and this binding protects SMAD3 from ubiquitin mediated proteasomal degradation by blocking its interaction with the RING finger protein, ROC1. Interestingly, APE1-redox-specific inhibition (APX2009) downregulated SMAD3 expression and the APE1 redox-deficient mutant (C65A) disrupted APE1-SMAD3 binding indicating that this regulation depends on APE1 redox activity.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings establish a role of APE1 in regulating SMAD3 in EAC. These findings provide a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of EAC by the pharmacological inhibition of APE1.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Smad,Redox,Ubiquitination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Farah Ballout<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Heng Lu<sup><\/sup>, Dunfa Peng<sup><\/sup>, Wael El-Rifai<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"541eda0f-1cdb-4a84-81e7-daa53655968b","ControlNumber":"2237","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

Genomic instability (GIN) is a recurrent feature of lung tumours that promotes drug resistance and other cancer hallmarks. One mechanism that enables tumour-promoting GIN is centrosome amplification (CA). Centrosomes are organelles involved in chromosome segregation during cell division and two centrosomes in a bipolar arrangement normally ensure equal division of the genome during mitosis. CA, an abnormal increase in centrosome number, is frequently observed in lung and other cancers despite the fact that it can cause lethal multipolar mitotic spindles that potentiate aneuploidy. To mitigate detrimental consequences of CA, cancer cells can cluster extra centrosomes into pseudo-bipolar mitotic spindles. This process is facilitated by a protein called KIFC1 which is upregulated in a large proportion of lung cancers. However, KIFC1&#8217;s potential as a therapeutic target in lung cancers with CA has not been explored. Here we investigate the hypothesis that lung cancers with CA are dependent on KIFC1 and sensitive to its inhibition.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Western blotting for KIFC1 and immunofluorescence (IF) for the centrosomal protein, CEP192, were used to measure basal expression and CA, respectively, across a panel of 21 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and 3 non-malignant (NM) cell lines. KIFC1 loss-of-function (LOF) in H1299 and PC9 (LUAD), and BEAS-2B (NM) was achieved using CRISPR\/Cas9 and siRNA. <i>In vitro<\/i> competition assays were done to assess the relative fitness of mCherry-tagged wild-type and GFP-tagged KIFC1-LOF cells in mixed populations over 3-4 cell passages using flow cytometry. CA was potentiated in cells using low doses of the compound, CFI-400945. Clonogenic survival and IF experiments were also done to determine the consequences of KIFC1 LOF.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Our findings suggests that basal KIFC1 expression and CA across 21 LUAD cell lines and 3 NM controls are variable. However, we observed a positive correlation (R<sup>2<\/sup> = 0.52, p = 0.01) between KIFC1 expression and CA in LUAD lines. Competition assays revealed that KIFC1 LOF sensitizes LUAD cells with high KIFC1 expression, but not LUAD with low KIFC1 expression or NM cells, to pharmacologically-induced CA. Complementary siRNA experiments confirmed that KIFC1 LOF impairs the survival of cells with CA. Finally, we found that KIFC1 LOF was associated with an increase in multi-polar spindles.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>These findings support our hypothesis that LUAD with CA are dependent on KIFC1. We suspect its role in centrosome clustering explains this phenotype. Ongoing work is focused on validating these observations in additional models and clinical tumours to confirm its therapeutic potential in LUAD with CA, since combining KIFC1 inhibition with standard of care therapies that induce CA (eg. cisplatin, radiation) could represent an effective therapeutic strategy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Centrosome,Kinesin,Lung adenocarcinoma,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Christopher  Z.

Since TNBCs lack the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and progesterone receptor (PR), development of new TNBC treatment strategies is an urgent clinical need. Our previous studies have demonstrated that high expression and activity of SOX9 transcription factor positively related to TNBC cell growth and tumor metastasis <i>in vivo<\/i>. It may be possible to target the SOX9 transcription factor by targeting upstream SOX9-activating proteins.<br \/>Hypothesis: SOX9-binding protein, S100A10, regulates SOX9 activity and control TNBC growth.<br \/>Material and Methods: Immunoprecipitation (IP) in combination with mass spectrometry (IP-MS) analysis was used to identify SOX9 binding proteins, with support from MD Anderson&#8217;s proteomics core. The Mascot Score is a statistical score used as a measure of the reliability of identifying a specific protein by IP-MS. The data was summarized based on the Mascot Score. IP-Western Blotting analysis was used to confirm that S100A10 bound SOX9 in TNBC cells. We then treated TNBC cells with or without siRNAs of S100A10 to evaluate its effect on TNBC growth. Cell growth was measured using an automated cell counting assay. Protein and mRNA levels were examined by western blotting and qRT-PCR assays. SOX9 activity on regulating &#946;-catenin pathway was measured using TOP\/FOP luciferase activity analysis. Data are presented as mean values &#177; SD. Statistical significance was calculated using the Student&#8217;s <i>t<\/i>-test unless otherwise indicated.<br \/>Results: Using immunoprecipitation combined with mass spectrometry (IP-MS), we identified multiple SOX9-binding proteins. One of the identified SOX9-binding proteins was S100A10 (S100A10). Knockdown of S100A10 decreased TNBC cell growth <i>in vitro<\/i>. Using TOP\/FOP luciferase activity analysis, we demonstrated that S100A10 regulates the &#946;-catenin pathway. Thus, S100A10 is a potential activator of SOX9 that can be targeted to inhibit SOX9 downstream signaling and TNBC growth.<br \/>Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that S100A10 is a SOX9-binding protein, that regulates SOX9 downstream signaling and controls TNBC cell growth.<br \/>Implications: Inhibition of S100A10 represents a novel strategy to treat TNBCs.

However, little is known about the immune escape mechanisms and regulatory proteins, particularly those for NK, involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most common and lethal cancers. To identify the determinants of NK killing function, we performed an HCC cell line-based CRISPR\/Cas9 loss-of-function genetic screen, using a human whole membrane protein library containing ~7000 genes curated from 3 public membrane protein datasets. The human SNU449 was chosen as a representative HCC cell line for CRISPR\/Cas9 editing based on the genetic profile analysis, representing one HCC patient subpopulation (&#62; 30%) in the TCGA cohort. The cell line was incubated with NK92 cells at ratios of 2:1, 1:1, and 0.5:1. Bioinformatics methods for prioritizing genes (e.g., MAGeCK) were applied on 3 tested groups with different ratios. Single guide RNAs targeting genes in the antigen presentation machinery were depleted, including HLA-C, B2M, and TAP1\/2, whereas components of the tumor-immune synapse, such as NCR3LG1 and ICAM1, were enriched, confirming the validity of the screen. SLC33A1 (an endosomal acetylCoA transporter) and SLC31A1 (the major copper influx transporter) were also depleted, previously unknown as NK regulators. The effects of SLC33A1 and SLC31A1 were validated in individual gene knockout cells generated respectively by lentiviral sgRNA expression. Furthermore, knockout of either transporter in SNU449 cells increased IFN&#947; secretion, confirming NK92 activation. Our results revealed that CRISPR\/Cas9-based functional genomics screens in HCC cell lines could identify novel targets modulating NK-mediated killing. Further analysis of mechanisms of action, and particularly functional validation in <i>in vivo<\/i> systems, will potentially provide novel targets for the treatment of HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR\/Cas9,Natural killer cells,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Shuo Li<sup><\/sup>, Lin Han<sup><\/sup>, Siyao Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Guangfeng Geng<sup><\/sup>, Lei Huo<sup><\/sup>, Dawei Huang<sup><\/sup>, Zhaoren He<sup><\/sup>, Shuoran Li<sup><\/sup>, Zhaoshi Jiang<sup><\/sup>, <b>James  X.

We isolated conophylline as an inhibitor of K-Ras functions. It is known to ameliorate various disease models in animals, including cancer, diabetes mellitus, NASH, and hepatic cirrhosis. On the other hand, its molecular target was determined to be ADP-ribosylation factor-like 6-interacting protein 1 (ARL6ip1) using a conophylline-biotin conjugate. ARL6ip1 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, and the conophylline-binding domain was determined by deletion mutation analysis. Known functions of ARL6ip1 include inhibition of apoptosis, inhibition of glutamate transporter, and modulation of the ER structure. However, whether ARL6ip1 is involved in the mechanisms of various biological activities of conophylline has not been proven, since knockdown of ARL6ip1 has often failed to change the cellular phenotypes. Therefore, in the present research, we knocked out ARL6ip1 in human colon carcinoma cells by CRISPR-Cas9 and studied the involvement and mechanism of ARL6ip1 in the anticancer activity of conophylline. Ran activity was measured by a pull-down assay with Ran-GTP antibody.<br \/>Materials and Methods: Conophylline was isolated from the leaves of <i>Ervatamia microphylla<\/i>. We employed HCT116 and DLD1 cells as human colorectal cancer cells. Tumorigenicity was measured by soft agar colony formation. Cellular migration was measured by a wound healing assay and cell tracking analysis. Cellular invasion was measured by a Matrigel chamber assay.<br \/>Results: Conophylline inhibited soft agar colony formation in HCT116 and DLD1 cells. It inhibited migration and invasion in HCT116 and DLD1 cells at nontoxic concentrations. Knockout of ARL6ip1 also decreased tumorigenicity, migration, and invasion in HCT116 and DLD1 cells. The mechanistic study was carried out with HCT116 cells. ARL6 and Ran are both G-proteins and are reported to interact with ARL6ip1. Although knockdown of ARL6 did not change the cell migratory activity, knockdown of Ran inhibited the migration. Conophylline inhibited the interaction of ARL6ip1 to Ran in the proximity ligation assay. Moreover, conophylline inhibited the Ran activity.<br \/>Conclusion: CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of ARL6ip1 showed a similar anticancer activity as treatment with conophylline. It is likely that the anticancer activity of conophylline would be mediated by the ARL6ip1-Ran system. Thus, ARL6ip1 would be a useful molecular target for the treatment of cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,Migration,Invasion,Endoplasmic reticulum,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yinzhi Lin<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sivasundaram Karnan<sup>2<\/sup>, Hideaki Ito<sup>3<\/sup>, Kazuo Umezawa<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Aichi Medical Univ., Nagakute, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Biochemistry, Aichi Medical Univ., Nagakute, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Pathology, Aichi Medical Univ., Nagakute, Japan,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Molecular Target Medicine, Aichi Medical Univ., Nagakute, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d539657b-b55f-4065-994f-f65924e92779","ControlNumber":"4226","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

A better understanding of cancer cell metabolic regulation can also contribute to modulating the harsh tumor microenvironment, which strongly affects the efficacy of emerging anti-cancer immunotherapies. As one of the critical contributors to cancer therapy design, there is increasing demand for time-efficient and reliable analytic tools when searching for drugs and genes modulating cancer cell metabolism. The XF Real-Time ATP Rate Assay measures ATP production from glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration simultaneously and provides a quantitative overview of the bioenergetic phenotype of the cells. By using ATP production rate as a universal unit of bioenergetic metabolism, this assay quickly detects metabolic modulations induced by chemical stimuli or genetic modifications. It allows the identification of potential targets for therapy design. In this study, we used the Seahorse XF Pro Analyzer combined with the XF ATP Rate assay to screen 80 kinase inhibitors for the suppressive effects on energy metabolism and\/or inducing a metabolic phenotype shift in THP-1 cells, a monocytic leukemia cell line, using PBMC as the control. We identified four mitochondrial and two glycolytic suppressors using the screening and dose-response views available in Seahorse Analytics, a cloud-based data analysis tool for Seahorse XF assays. These compounds showed moderate or no effects on the net ATP production rates but induced a significant shift in the metabolic phenotype of THP-1 cells. Among the selected kinase inhibitors, AG-879 (ErbB2 inhibitor), SU-1498 (VEGFR inhibitor), and U-0126 (MEK1\/2 inhibitor) showed the most potent inhibitory effect on mitochondrial energy production in THP-1 cells. Dose-response studies indicated that SU-1498 and U-0126 have higher potency in THP-1 than PBMC, and thus they can be considered good cancer-cell targets for mitochondrial suppressors. In contrast, AG-879 showed a similar or higher inhibitory effect on PBMC even though it is the most potent mitochondrial suppressor among the selected compounds. These results demonstrate that the XF Real-Time ATP Rate Assay can be used as a primary assay for screening and validating drug candidate(s) targeting the bioenergetic metabolism of cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Screening,Mitochondria,Kinase inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yoonseok Kam<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Lisa Winer<sup><\/sup>, Natalia Romero<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Agilent Technologies, Inc., Lexington, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"fce5c6a6-7afc-4304-9e7f-fc02f371afef","ControlNumber":"5011","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;Y.

Genetic engineering based on cancer cell lines is no doubt a useful and promising approach in induction of new therapeutic targets\/elements while maintaining intrinsic characteristics of original cell in parallel. Recently, the emergence of CRISPR knock-in technology has accelerated precise editing across whole genome, from gene depletion, small fragment insertions to site-direct mutations, thereby prompting our understanding of the influence of a specific oncotarget in given tumor genetic background. Herein, by employing CRISPR\/Cas9 system, two human cancer cell line-based, inheritable drug resistance models were established where the mutation site C481S of BTK in REC-1 conferred resistance to Ibrutinib and the mutation site R537S\/D538G of ESR1 exerted resistance to Fulvestrant in MCF-7. In addition, the engineered cell models also enable the mechanism characterization and development of viable therapeutic agents targeting those oncogenic-driver mutations in a subtype of cancers. The murine colon cancer cell line CT26, which harbors KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> mutation, was genetically modified to express KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> protein to allow for an expandable pocket providing opportunities for compound recruitment. The resultant KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> CT26 cell line showed pronounced inhibitory effect after treatment with AMG510. More interestingly, the therapeutic combination involving both AMG510 and anti-PD1 antibodies demonstrated more effective anti-tumor activities when compared to monotherapy. Moreover, CRIPSR-mediated engineered knock-in cells with a traceable tag linked to endogenous oncotarget also exhibit capability in new therapeutic modality discovery. Based on HiBiT protein tagging technology, we generated a series of HiBiT knock-in cell lines for real-time cell-based protein degradation analysis on various compelling targets, such as ESR1, KRAS, and BRD4, <i>et al<\/i>. Thereby, the construction of these <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> models with the ease of CRISPR KI technology is indispensable in new generation of therapeutic drug exploration.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-06 New nonclinical models for targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer cell,CRISPR,,Modeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nengwei Xu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Reifeng Wang<sup><\/sup>, Jian Xiang<sup><\/sup>, Qingyang Gu<sup><\/sup>, Xiangnan Qiang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>WuXi AppTec, Suzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7a54f692-8279-4ad7-a389-7038205f0bd5","ControlNumber":"3175","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

Glutamine is converted into the cell to glutamate by glutaminase (GLS) and utilized by the TCA cycle. This glutaminolysis has been implicated in tumor progression in various malignancies, including renal cell carcinoma. In the present study, we investigated whether the unique strategy that effectively targets glutamine addiction would be effective as a treatment for RCC.<br \/>Methods: Tumor tissue (T) and normal renal tissue (N) from surgical specimens of 66 patients with RCC were collected, and metabolomic analysis using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC\/MS) to calculate the T\/N ratio of Gln and Glu, respectively, were performed. In addition, immunohistological (IHC) staining of paraffin-embedded sections of 106 metastatic RCC cases was used to compare GLS and ASCT2 expression in tumor and normal tissue. In vitro, cell viability of the human RCC cell lines 786-O and 769-P was assessed by WST-8 assays. The protein expression was detected by Western blotting. Intracellular concentrations of glutamine and glutamate were analyzed using LC\/MS. V9302 was used as the specific ASCT2 inhibitor, and CB839 as the specific GLS inhibitor. As the xenograft model in vivo, athymic nude mice were injected subcutaneously with 786-O cells and given various doses of V9302 and CB839 intraperitoneally.<br \/>Results: LC\/MS assays using surgical specimens showed a notable increase in glutamine concentration in tumor tissue. IHC assays confirmed high expression of ASCT2 in tumor tissue, and patients with high expression of ASCT2 had a poorer prognosis than those with low expression. Treatment of V9302 with 786-O and 769-P resulted in a limited decrease in cell viability. LC\/MS analysis confirmed that V9302 treatment reduced glutathione metabolites. V9302 administration was shown to increase intracellular glutamine levels, presumably by compensatory mechanisms, whereas the combination of V9302 and CB839 significantly decreased glutamine levels in 786-O cells. Western blot analysis showed that the expression levels of ASCT2 and GLS1 decreased after the combination therapy. The xenograft study confirmed that the combination of V9302 and CB839 significantly inhibited 786-O tumor growth compared with controls within three weeks after treatment (p &#60;0.001).<br \/>Conclusion: It has been shown that ASCT2 expression is a marker of poor prognosis in RCC and that suppression of ASCT2 has an antitumor effect by affecting glutathione metabolism. On the other hand, the administration of V9302 raised the issue that a compensatory mechanism increases intracellular glutamine levels. Our results suggest that a novel combination strategy using CB839 in addition to V9302 could overcome the tolerance for the monotherapy and effectively target glutamine addiction in RCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-06 New nonclinical models for targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glutamine metabolism,Therapeutic target,Kidney cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yoshinari Muto<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Akihito Takeuchi<sup>1<\/sup>, Kenji Zennami<sup>2<\/sup>, Eiji Sugihara<sup>3<\/sup>, Ryoichi Shiroki<sup>2<\/sup>, Hideyuki Saya<sup>3<\/sup>, Makoto Sumitomo<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Fujita Cancer Center and Department of Urology School of Medicine, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Urology School of Medicine, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Fujita Cancer Center, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"24e3a242-3547-4f17-9124-7d12319b3477","ControlNumber":"642","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Sensitive quantification of proteins in complex biological samples is routinely achieved by immunoassays that use antibodies specific to target proteins. Such approaches can be a limitation in IO drug discovery and development as de novo development of antibodies is associated with long lead times, high costs, and high failure rates.<br \/>Protein quantification using mass spectrometry (MS) is agnostic to species and matrices and removes the barriers of availability or specificity of antibody-based assay. Further, MS proteomics workflows can support both large scale discovery studies but also represent an attractive alternative to targeted quantitative studies.<br \/>The main purpose of this work is to assess the performance of the TrueDiscovery&#8482; and TrueSignature&#8482; MS-proteomics platforms for the deep proteome and surfaceome profiling of human primary and immortalized immune cells compared to flow cytometry solutions. We assess the number of quantified proteins and specifically the coverage of immune cell marker proteins in primary human immune cells across cell count groups from 2 million down to 2500 immune cells. In addition, we compared the quantification of a multiplexed surface antigens panel using TrueSignature&#8482; and QIFI&#174; flow cytometry platforms.<br \/>We found that the applied MS-based proteomics workflows achieve high sensitivity and robustness in detection and quantification of immune cell markers down to 2500 primary immune cells.
