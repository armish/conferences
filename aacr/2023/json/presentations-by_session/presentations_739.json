Due to the high incidence (~80%) of CD70 antigen expression in primary and mRCC, yet limited expression in normal tissue, ccRCC is an attractive proof-of-concept tumor for CD70 directed allogeneic CAR T. TRAVERSE (NCT04696731), a first-in-human trial, seeks to identify a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ALLO-316 after conditioning with fludarabine\/cyclophosphamide with\/without ALLO-647 in pts with advanced or metastatic ccRCC. ALLO-316 is an anti-CD70 allogeneic CAR T cell product that utilizes TALEN&#174; gene editing to knock out TCR&#945; constant gene to reduce the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and knock out CD52 gene to permit use of ALLO-647 (a humanized anti-CD52 mAb) to selectively deplete host T cells without affecting allogeneic CAR T cells.<br \/>Methods: This multicenter, single-arm, open-label, 3+3 dose-escalation trial enrolls adults with advanced or metastatic ccRCC and &#8805;1 measurable lesion and ECOG Performance Status 0 or 1. Prior treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor and a vascular endothelial growth-factor targeted therapy was required, with evidence of progression on\/after treatment or discontinuation due to toxicity. ALLO-316 is administered at escalating doses (40 - 240 X 10<sup>6<\/sup> allogeneic CAR+ cells IV) on Day 0 after conditioning. The primary endpoint is a target incidence rate for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) &#60;33% in the first 28 days after infusion of ALLO-316.<br \/>Results: By 12\/3\/2022, 18 pts with ccRCC (median age: 63 yrs; 82% male) were enrolled; all (100%) 17 pts who received ALLO-316, had metastatic disease with 3 lines (median) of prior therapy. Eleven (65%) of these pts experienced CRS, all low Gr except one (6%) Gr 3. No ICANS or GVHD was observed. One (6%) DLT (elevated LFT) was observed and required dose expansion. MTD has not yet been reached. Three pts achieved best overall response of PR at all time points with two PRs confirmed at subsequent visits; ORR = 12% and disease control rate (DCR) = 71%. In pts with confirmed CD70+ tumors (n=9), confirmed ORR = 22% (unconfirmed ORR = 33%) and DCR = 100%. High CAR T cell expansion was observed in peripheral blood (median C<sub>max<\/sub> &#62; 35,000 copies\/&#956;g) and high VCN in available tumor aspirates (n=3).<br \/>Conclusions: ALLO-316, an allogeneic CAR T cell product targeting CD70 in advanced mRCC, is demonstrating encouraging antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile. A single administration of ALLO-316 could be an effective treatment for pts with CD70+ solid tumors, including RCC, and hematologic malignancies. The MTD for ALLO-316 in TRAVERSE will support Phase 2 trial design. Enrollment of pts with CD70+ tumors is ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Renal cell carcinoma,CAR T Therapy,Allogeneic,Anti-CD70,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Samer Srour<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ritesh Kotecha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brendan Curti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jad Chahoud<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alexandra Drakaki<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lily Tang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lovely Goyal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sacha Prashad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Victoria Szenes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin Norwood<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sumanta Pal<\/i><\/presenter>.

Petosemtamab is a human, common light chain, IgG1 bispecific antibody with ADCC-enhanced activity, targeting EGFR and LGR5, which has shown potent antitumor activity in patient (pt)-derived HNSCC xenograft models. In the dose escalation part of an ongoing phase 1\/2 study, the RP2D was established at 1500 mg Q2W, 4 week cycle (JCO 2021:39.3 Sup 62). Petosemtamab is being investigated in the expansion part in pts with selected advanced solid tumors. Promising activity was seen in HNSCC pts previously treated with both platinum-based chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors (MCT 2021:20 Sup12 P185). We present data of the expanded HNSCC cohort treated at the RP2D. Primary objective (expansion): investigator-assessed ORR per RECIST 1.1. Secondary objectives: ORR, DOR, PFS (per investigator and central review), OS and safety\/tolerability. Key eligibility criteria: advanced\/metastatic HNSCC, prior standard therapy, ECOG PS 0-1, measurable disease (RECIST 1.1), baseline tumor biopsy. At the data cutoff date (28 Nov 2022), 49 HNSCC pts were treated. Median age was 63 years (range 31-77), ECOG PS 0\/1: 13\/35 pts, and 78% were male. Most frequent primary tumor locations were oropharynx (35%), oral cavity (31%), and larynx (16%). Pts received a median of 2 (range 1-4) lines of prior systemic therapy, including anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 in 96% of pts and platinum-based chemotherapy in 92% of pts; 2 pts received prior cetuximab. A median of 4 treatment cycles (range 1-21) was administered, with 17 pts continuing on therapy at the cutoff. Among 42 pts evaluable for efficacy (&#8805;2 cycles and &#8805;1 postbaseline scan, or early PD), ORR per investigator was 35.7% (15\/42), including 1 CR (ongoing after 18 months), 12 PRs, and 2 unconfirmed PRs with treatment ongoing at the cutoff. 15 pts had SD and DCR was 71.4%. Median DOR was 6.0 months (95%CI=3.3-not calculable). Median PFS was 5.0 months (95%CI=3.2-6.8). Of 78 pts treated at the RP2D (escalation and all expansion cohorts), the most frequent AEs regardless of causality (all grades\/G3-4) were rash (33%\/0%), hypotension (26%\/6%), dyspnea (26%\/4%), nausea (26%\/1%), dermatitis acneiform (24%\/1%), blood magnesium decreased (19%\/5%), erythema (19%\/0%), diarrhea (19%\/0%); IRRs (composite term) were reported in 74%\/21% of pts, mostly at the first infusion, and all resolved. 5 pts (6%) discontinued treatment due to IRRs on Day 1. 1 esophageal cancer pt died due to unrelated G5 GI bleeding. Retrospective biomarker analyses will be presented. Petosemtamab demonstrates promising clinical efficacy with a manageable safety profile in pretreated HNSCC pts. Further clinical development in HNSCC is planned with petosemtamab monotherapy and in combination with SOC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,EGFR,Bispecific antibody,ADCC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ezra E.

REGN5459, a BCMAxCD3 bispecific Ab, binds to BCMA on MM cells and with low affinity to CD3 on T cells, triggering T-cell activation and plasma cell depletion with low cytokine release preclinically. This first-in-human study aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of REGN5459 monotherapy in pts with R\/R MM.<br \/>Methods: Eligible pts had received &#8805;3 prior lines of tx including an anti-CD38 Ab, proteasome inhibitor, and immunomodulatory drug, and had exhausted all available tx options. Pts could receive REGN5459 until progression\/intolerable toxicity. Primary objectives were to assess safety, tolerability, dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), and determine the recommended Ph 2 dose (RP2D) of REGN5459 (Ph 1) and assess efficacy of REGN5459 (Ph 2) per ORR.<br \/>Results: As of June 9, 2022, 43 pts were enrolled (Ph 1, 33; Ph 2, 10): median age 67 yrs (range, 26-85), 51% female, 16% high cytogenetic risk, 14% extramedullary plasmacytoma, 37% R-ISS Stage III disease, 61% triple-class refractory, and median of 5 (range, 2-9) prior lines of tx. In Ph 1, one DLT was reported in a pt receiving the highest dose (900 mg; Gr 3 hypoxia, pt later found to have primary lung cancer). RP2D was identified as 480 mg. All pts enrolled had &#8805;1 TEAE, 74% had Gr &#8805;3 TEAEs. TEAEs all-Gr in &#8805;30% of pts were CRS (54%), fatigue (44%), neutropenia (37%), anemia (35%), cough (30%), and diarrhea (30%). Gr &#8805;3 TEAEs in &#8805;15% of pts were neutropenia (37%), anemia (26%), lymphopenia (23%), thrombocytopenia (19%), and hypertension (16%). CRS Gr 1, 2, and 3 were reported in 47%, 2%, and 5%, respectively; there was no Gr 4 or 5 CRS. No Gr 3 CRS with RP2D. Tocilizumab was used in 19% and steroids in 9% of pts. One pt developed ICANS (2%, Gr 2). Incidence of serious TEAEs and TEAEs leading to tx discontinuation was 63% and 16%. Infections occurred in 61% (37% Gr &#8805;3). After data-cutoff, two deaths due to COVID pneumonia and COVID infection have been reported. ORR was 67% (58% &#8805;VGPR) for the entire cohort and 100% (85% &#8805;VGPR; 15% sCR; 39% CR) among pts receiving the RP2D (n=13). Median follow-up was 7 mos (range, 1-26) with longest response ongoing for 22+ mos. Median time to response was 0.8 mos. Median DOR was NR (95% CI, 12-NE); 12-mo DOR for RP2D was 66.7% (95% CI, 5.4-94.5). Of pts in &#8805;CR with available MRD results (n=8), 50% were MRD negative at the 10<sup>-5 <\/sup>threshold.<br \/>Conclusion: These initial data show that REGN5459 has acceptable safety\/tolerability in R\/R MM with most CRS of low grade and low incidence of ICANS. Modulation of CD3 affinity on bispecific Abs to maximize tumor killing, and mitigate CRS and T-cell exhaustion, warrants further research. Efficacy in this heavily pre-treated cohort was encouraging, with 100% ORR with the RP2D. Updated data will be presented at the meeting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,Multiple myeloma,Phase I,BCMA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Attaya Suvannasankha<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Prashant Kapoor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew J.

Use of antibodies (e.g., J591) to target PSMA with higher potency radionuclides (e.g., 225Ac) impacts kinetics, biodistribution, clinical efficacy, and toxicities. In our first-in-human ph I dose-escalation study of single dose 225Ac-J591 in patients with mCRPC, no MTD was reached (max dose 93.3 KBq\/kg). Following this, we developed ph I\/II parallel dose-escalation studies of fractionated (D1, D15) single cycle and multiple (q6w) dose regimens. Here we present safety data from the initial fractionated study in predominantly 177Lu-naive.<br \/>Methods: Eligible patients had adequate organ function, ECOG performance status 0-2, and progressive mCRPC following potent AR pathway inhibitor (ARPI) and chemo (or unfit\/refusing). Prior 177Lu-PSMA was allowed until an amendment developed a separate study for post-177Lu-PSMA. Baseline 68Ga-PSMA PET scans were performed, but not used to determine eligibility. A 3+3 dose-escalation design was used. Phase I primary objective: determination of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D). DLT was defined as within 8 weeks of first dose: neutropenia (Gr 4 or febrile neutropenia), thrombocytopenia (TCP) (Gr 4, or Gr 3 with clinically significant bleeding), any Gr &#62;2 non-hematologic toxicity deemed to be at least possibly related to 225Ac-J591, or any attributable toxicity precluding or delaying the second dose by &#62;2 weeks. Secondary\/exploratory objectives: efficacy measures (e.g., PSA decline, radiographic RR, biochemical\/radiographic PFS, OS, CTCs, patient reported outcomes), safety (CTCAE v5), and correlatives (plasma and tissue genomics, PSMA imaging).<br \/>Results: 24 patients were enrolled in phase I. Median age 73.5 (57-91), PSA 25.78 (3.39-2133.41); 53% (n=13) &#62;1 prior ARPI, 58% (n=14) taxane chemo, 8% (n=2) anti-PSMA therapy, 12.5% (n=3) prior 223Ra. CALGB prognostic groups: Good 4 (16%), Intermediate 8 (33%), Poor 12 (50%). No DLTs were observed in Cohort 1 (n=3) or 2 (n=6). In C3, 2\/6 subjects experienced DLTs (Gr 3 weakness, Gr 2 TCP with &#62;2 week delay in second fraction). 8 patients were enrolled in an intermediate dose cohort (2.5) with 1 DLT (Gr 4 TCP). Two patients withdrew before the second dose (intercurrent illness; interruption of 225Ac supply). Most common low gr non-hematologic treatment emergent AEs: fatigue (95%), xerostomia (69%), and nausea (57%). Among evaluable patients for PSA change (n=22), 21 (95%) experienced PSA decline with 14 (67%) with decline of 50% and 6 (37%) with decline of 90%. 13\/21 patients had CTCs samples collected at baseline and 12 wks; 5 were unfavorable at baseline (&#8805;5\/7.5 mL); 10\/13 (77%) remained favorable or converted from unfavorable to favorable; 6\/12 (50%) had 50% decline in CTC count; and 5\/13 (38%) converted from detectable to undetectable.<br \/>Conclusions: A single fractionated cycle of 225Ac-J591 was delivered with few high grade AEs and with evidence of preliminary efficacy by PSA and CTC changes across all dose levels.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL02-01 Placeholder Abstracts: Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA),Radioimmunotherapy,Prostate cancer,Phase I,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jones T.
