[{"Abstract":"In this study we propose to combine feeder cell-free PM21 particle activation of Natural Killer (NK) cells with memory-like induction using cytokines IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 to produce highly proliferative, persistent memory-like NK cells with great therapeutic potential. Development of NK cell therapeutics has risen to prominence in recent years for use as potential anti-cancer therapy. For clinical applications, NK cells are typically either <i>ex vivo<\/i> activated with cytokines or expanded with feeder cells or by feeder cell-free methods. One such method for expansion uses plasma membrane particles containing surface IL-21 and 41BBL (PM21) that allows for feeder cell-free expansion of highly cytotoxic NK cells. Activation of NK cells with IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 has been shown to induce memory-like properties in NK cells with enhanced proliferative potential and persistence. In this study, use of cytokines with PM21 particles for NK cell expansion (CAP-NK cells) led to an increase from an average 2,400-fold expansion with PM21-particles alone (PM21-NK cells) to 13,600-fold in 14 days (p&#60;0.01) when grown in flasks. Using G-Rex&#174; Well Plates, a scalable clinically relevant platform, CAP-NK cells could be expanded an average 33-fold in just 7 days compared to 6-fold for PM21-NK cells (p&#60;0.005). CAP NK cells had enhanced proliferation, decreased doubling time, and an increase in the percent of CD25<sup>+<\/sup>41BB<sup>+<\/sup> NK cells (14% of PM21-NK cells vs 82% of CAP-NK cells; p&#60;0.0001). CAP-NK cells also demonstrated higher levels of basal and compensatory glycolysis and increased maximal respiration compared to PM21-NK cells. CAP-NK cells demonstrated enhanced effector functions; they were more cytotoxic against ovarian (SKOV-3) and lung (A549) cancer cells compared to PM21-NK cells (SKOV-3: 58% vs 42%, p=0.0002; A549: 77% vs 65% at 24 h at 1:1 E:T, p=0.001) and had increased IFN&#947; production after stimulation with cytokines or K562 cells. Importantly, CAP-NK cells also demonstrated memory-like properties. After expansion for 14 days, NK cells were cold-washed and rested for 7 days with 1 ng\/mL IL-15. Rested CAP-NK cells had increased IFN&#947; production when re-stimulated with IL-12, IL-15 and IL-18 (MFI 5353 vs 3679; p&#60;0.01) and higher potency against K562 (EC<sub>50<\/sub> 0.58 vs 1.17; p&#60;0.05) as compared to rested PM21-NK cells. Finally, cryopreserved CAP-NK cells showed improved persistence 21 days after <i>i.p<\/i>. injection with no exogenous cytokine support in NSG mice. Additionally, CAP-NK cells could home to and control tumor growth in an orthotopic K562 model. Taken together, the CAP-NK method results in highly proliferative, highly cytotoxic memory-like NK cells amenable to clinical use.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Adoptive cell therapy,Immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jeremiah  L.

Memory-like (ML) differentiation of NK cells using brief IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 activation generates a safe allogenic NK cellular therapy for acute myeloid leukemia that induce complete remissions. Here, we investigate pre-clinical combinations with ML NK cells for MM, including blockade of the inhibitory NKG2A\/HLA-E checkpoint as well as MM-specific targeting via myeloma-targeting monoclonal antibody (mAb) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) engineering.<br \/>Human ML NK cells generated from healthy donors display IFN-&#947; responses similar to conventional (cNK) cells, and only modestly increased cytotoxicity against myeloma cell lines (MM1.s and OPM2). MM cell lines and primary MM cells express high levels of HLA-E, a major negative checkpoint for ML NK cells that binds to the inhibitory receptor NKG2A expressed on NK cells. Indeed, mass cytometry analysis of MM patients compared to healthy controls demonstrated enrichment of a NK cell population expressing high levels of NKG2A, but also high levels of activation and cytotoxic markers. Disruption of HLA-E binding to NKG2A with the blocking mAb monalizumab (AstraZeneca) significantly increased healthy donor ML NK cell IFN-&#947; response (P=0.016), degranulation (surface CD107a, P=0.017), and killing (P=0.009) of MM1.s when compared to isotype mAb. NK cells isolated from patients with MM showed similarly enhanced functionality after ML differentiation and NKG2A blockade (IFN-&#947; P=0.008). In an NSG mouse model of MM using MM1.s cells, healthy donor ML NK cells combined with monalizumab showed improved control of MM tumor growth compared to ML NK cells without monalizumab (P&#60;0.001), conventional NK cells, or control tumors alone (P&#60;0.001).<br \/>To further improve recognition of MM, ML NK cells responses were assessed in combinationwith a mAb against SLAMF7 (elotuzumab) that both targets MM cells and activates NK cells. Elotuzumab treatment increased the functionality of ML NK cells against MM cell lines (IFN-&#947;, P=0.004) with an additive effect of both elotuzumab and monalizumab (IFN-&#947;, P=0.003). In an alternative strategy to enhance MM targeting, we engineered an anti-BCMA CAR (anti-BCMA\/4-1bb\/z) into ML NK cells. BCMA-CAR<sup>+<\/sup> NK cells exhibited increased IFN-&#947; (P=0.001) production and degranulation (P&#60;0.001) against MM1.s compared to non-transduced control NK cells. These functional responses were additionally enhanced with ML differentiation.<br \/>Collectively, these findings suggest that ML NK cell differentiation, combined with strategies to address inhibitory checkpoints (NKG2A) or MM-specific activation (elotuzumab, anti-BMCA CAR), are promising cellular therapy strategies for MM patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Multiple myeloma,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Chimeric antigen receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alice  Y.

However, improvements to support persistence and maintain durable anti-tumor activity within the tumor microenvironment may be necessary to achieve meaningful clinical efficacy. Here we describe the preclinical activity of CAT-248, a CD70-directed CAR-NK cell therapy, engineered using the TcBuster&#8482; Transposon System (Bio-Techne) multiplexed with CRISPR\/Cas9 editing. CD70 is highly expressed in many tumor types while normal tissue expression is restricted to a subset of activated immune cells. CAT-248 is an allogeneic, healthy donor peripheral blood-derived NK cell product designed for durable efficacy against CD70 expressing tumors. CAT-248 is engineered to express CD70 CAR, interleukin 15 (IL-15), and transforming growth factor &#946; (TGF&#946;) dominant negative receptor (DNR). In addition, CAT-248 includes CRISPR\/Cas9 knockout of CD70 to mitigate fratricide due to endogenous CD70 expression in activated NK cells. IL-15 enhances persistence of CAT-248 to enable durable efficacy, and TGF&#946; DNR enables CAT-248 to maintain high activity in TGF&#946;-enriched and immunosuppressive solid tumor microenvironments. CAT-248 is manufactured using transposon-based engineering which enables stable integration of the three transgenes and CRISPR\/Cas9 knockout of CD70 in a single electroporation step, resulting in 40-80% CAR expression and 80-90% knockout of CD70 in CAT-248 NK cells. CAT-248 activity was characterized across a panel of <i>in vitro<\/i> assays to evaluate the function of CD70 CAR, TGF&#946; DNR, and IL-15 transgenes. CD70-directed cytotoxicity was assessed against a panel of tumor cell lines with a broad range of CD70 expression. <i>In vitro<\/i>, CAT-248 cells demonstrated both CAR-dependent cytotoxicity and over 2-fold greater secretion of effector cytokines IFN&#947; and TNF&#945; than control NK cells. TGF&#946; DNR effectively prevented TGF&#946;-induced SMAD phosphorylation and TGF&#946;-induced downregulation of DNAM-1, an NK cell activating receptor. IL-15 secretion enabled <i>in vitro<\/i> NK cell expansion over a 9-day time course without exogenous cytokine support. To confirm cytolytic activity <i>in vivo<\/i>, CAT-248 cells were administered therapeutically in a 786-O CD70<sup>+<\/sup> renal cell carcinoma xenograft model. CAT-248 cells effectively controlled tumor, demonstrating &#62;99% reduction in tumor burden relative to control NK cells (p&#60;0.01). Further, CAT-248 cells demonstrated significant <i>in vivo<\/i> persistence beyond 4 weeks post-dosing in peripheral blood. Overall, the results demonstrate the potential for CAT-248 as a novel off-the-shelf, cryopreserved, allogeneic NK cell therapy for CD70-positive renal cell carcinoma and other solid tumor malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,CD70,Chimeric antigen receptor,TGF-&#946;,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Bashar Hamza<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Eugene Choi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Dominic Picarella<sup>1<\/sup>, Finola Moore<sup>1<\/sup>, Angela Nunez<sup>1<\/sup>, Henry Moreno<sup>1<\/sup>, Marilyn Marques<sup>1<\/sup>, Alexia Barandiaran<sup>1<\/sup>, Meghan Walsh<sup>1<\/sup>, Kisha Pradhan<sup>1<\/sup>, Krista Daniel<sup>1<\/sup>, Kelly Becker<sup>1<\/sup>, Jennifer Johnson<sup>1<\/sup>, Karl Malakian<sup>1<\/sup>, Keith  H.

However, its efficacy is limited, especially in solid tumors. This is partly because the CAR T cells become dysfunctional and exhausted in the tumor microenvironment. However, the key pathways responsible for impaired function of exhausted T cells remain unclear. Immunosuppressive cytokines or checkpoint proteins like TGF-&#946; and PD-L1, are overproduced, which may lead to the downregulation of CD8+ T cell action and the promotion of T-reg maturation. E3 ligase Casitas B-Lineage Lymphoma Proto-Oncogene B (CBL-B) is a key negative modulator of T\/NK-cell receptor and co-stimulatory regulation. CBL-B inhibition lowers the threshold of antigen-specific T\/NK cell activation, even in absence of co-stimulatory signaling or the presence of an immune suppressive environment. Genetic ablation of CBL-B or functional inactivation of its E3 ligase activity in mice or primary human T cells enhances immune-mediated tumor growth control. Therefore, CBL-B inhibition may address the suboptimal response to current immunotherapies due to low inflammation, no\/low co-stimulation signal or a high immune suppressive environment. Several groups demonstrated that deficiency of CBL-B overcomes endogenous CD8+ T-cell exhaustion, and deletion of CBL-B in CAR-T cells renders them resistant to exhaustion and deletion of CBL-B in CAR-NK cells provides greater resistance to TGF-&#946;.<br \/>Methods: We tested the CAR expression, T\/NK cell activation and in vitro cytotoxicity when ex vivo culture of CAR-T or CAR-NK cells with CBL-B inhibitors.<br \/>Results: We demonstrated that the combination of CBL-B inhibitor and CAR-NK cells elicited remarkable persistence in multiple runs of repeated cancer cell clearance assay, as compared to CAR-NK cells alone. Moreover, the combination of CAR-NK cells with both anti-PDL1-IL15 and CBL-B inhibitor showed further increased persistence in repeated cancer cell clearance assay.<br \/>Conclusions: preclinical data provided evidence of CBL-B inhibitors to enhance key parameters associated with T\/NK cell activation and reduce susceptibility to immune suppression. Our results suggest the combination strategy of cell therapy and immune regulating small\/large molecule therapy might achieve better anti-tumor efficacy in both hematological and solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ubiquitination,Adoptive cell therapy,PD-L1,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Cuiqing Yang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yifang Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Tingting Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Fuwei Jiang<sup>1<\/sup>, Chao Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Qingyang Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Qin Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhengtao Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Wansun Mai<sup>2<\/sup>, Gang Ye<sup>1<\/sup>, Renhong Tang<sup>3<\/sup>, Zhuoxiao Cao<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Shanghai Simnova Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Hainan Sparkle Therapeutics Co., Ltd, Hainan, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Jiangsu Simcere Pharmaceuticals Co.

Unlike T-cell therapies, allogeneic NK cells do not cause toxicities such as serious cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, or graft-vs-host-disease, and are less expensive. We believe NK cell-based therapies provide an important platform for &#8220;off-shelf&#8221; allogeneic cell therapies, so we designed a panel of arming strategies to enhance NK cytotoxicity and elicit deep and durable response. CD16a is a transmembrane protein that co-localizes with CD3&#950; and Fc&#949;RI&#947; on NK cells and binds to the Fc portion of IgG antibodies. Upon ligation, it induces a potent series of signals resulting in cytokine production and cytotoxic effector activity via ADCC. Here we use the term CD16 to refer to CD16a on NK cells. CD16 is a potent activating receptor and is necessary for NK cell cytotoxic effector, so engineered CD16 is the cornerstone of NK enhancing strategy. CD16 displays a functional allelic dimorphism generating allotypes with either a phenylalanine (F) or a valine (V) residue at amino acid position 158. CD16VV is associated with higher ADCC activity and clinical response than CD16VF and CD16FF. However, only 15% of the population is CD16VV that maximizes ADCC. Several studies reported that tumor microenvironment may cause the shedding of CD16 which suppresses ADCC though ADAM17-mediated proteolytic cleavage upon NK cell activation. Therefore, selective inhibition of ADAM17 can reduce the shedding of CD16 in NK cells.<br \/>Method: We designed a library of CD16 point mutations in the cleavage region of ADAM17 to screen for ADAM17-resistant CD16 mutations to prevent CD16 shedding and improve the efficacy of NK therapy. NK92 cells lacking expression of endogenous CD16 were transduced to express wild type CD16 or CD16 mutations, then activated with PMA. The surface expression of CD16 on these cells was then examined using flow cytometry.<br \/>Result: We found 3 mutations effectively blocked CD16 cleavage in cell-based assays, while wild-type CD16 and other CD16 mutations underwent a marked down-regulation of expression. We also demonstrated these 3 mutations were resistant to cleavage when expressed in the human primary NK cells and did not disrupt IgG binding.<br \/>Conclusion: We developed a non-cleavable CD16 with high affinity to Fc receptor, which can be expressed in engineered NK cells to develop a next generation NK therapy to elicit more potent and durable cytotoxic response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Natural killer cells,ADCC,Mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Cuiqing Yang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Fuwei Jiang<sup>1<\/sup>, Yifang Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Tingting Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Qingyang Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Qin Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Gang Ye<sup>1<\/sup>, Renhong Tang<sup>2<\/sup>, Zhuoxiao Cao<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Shanghai Simnova Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Jiangsu Simcere Pharmaceuticals Co.

Allogeneic donor derived NK cells have shown promising clinical outcomes in both hematological and solid tumor malignancies but have a short lifespan in the absence of cytokine support. Interleukin (IL)-15 is a pleiotropic cytokine that promotes the survival, proliferation, and cytotoxicity of NK cells. In this study, we engineered human peripheral blood-derived NK cells to co-express a CAR and calibrated release (cr) IL-15 and studied how crIL-15 affected CAR-NK cell functions. Senti Bio has designed the calibrated release technology to simultaneously produce membrane bound and secreted cytokines, such as IL-15 and IL-12, to provide autocrine and paracrine activity. We further validated crIL-15 activity in vitro and demonstrated enhanced NK cell persistence, tumor killing and autocrine activity in CAR NK cells as well as paracrine stimulation of neighboring T cells and NK cells via pSTAT5 activation. Additionally, we examined in vivo persistence and biodistribution of NK cells engineered with crIL-15 and a nanoluc reporter. crIL-15 NK cells were intravenously (i.v.) injected into NSG mice. These NK cells were detected in the lung, femur, spleen, liver and stomach 1 day post injection by bioluminescence imaging and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and lasted up to 20 days in the lung. In addition, crIL-15 increased CAR-NK cells persistence in a dose-dependent manner compared to unengineered NK cells. Injection of higher CAR-NK cell numbers (15&#215; 10<sup>6<\/sup> vs 7.5&#215; 10<sup>6<\/sup> CAR<sup>+<\/sup> cells per mouse) or multiple NK dosages (1 vs 3 doses) both contributed to prolonged persistence. Finally, we studied how crIL-15 affected CAR-NK cell anti-tumor function in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) xenograft models. MV4-11-Fluc AML tumor cells were co-injected with engineered NK cells expressing a FLT3 and\/or CD33 bivalent activating CAR, a EMCN inhibitory CAR and crIL-15 into NSG-Tg (Hu-IL15) mice via i.v. injection. Our data showed that these CAR-NK cells significantly reduced MV4-11 tumor burden and prolonged mouse survival compared to unengineered NK cells. The improved anti-tumor functions correlated with IL-15 levels produced by the CAR-NK cells. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that crIL-15 can improve persistence and anti-tumor activity of CAR-NK cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,IL-15,Chimeric antigen receptor,Persistence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chen-Ting Lee<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Michelle Hung<sup><\/sup>, Andrew Banicki<sup><\/sup>, Wenqi Song<sup><\/sup>, Niran Almudhfar<sup><\/sup>, Deepika Kaveri<sup><\/sup>, Priscilla Wong<sup><\/sup>, Lawrence Naitmazi<sup><\/sup>, Marcela Guzman<sup><\/sup>, Alice Lam<sup><\/sup>, Gozde Yucel<sup><\/sup>, Timothy Lu<sup><\/sup>, Alba  G.

It metastasizes almost exclusively to the lung, and this constitutes the main cause of death in these patients. Immune therapy has shown limited benefit. We investigated whether epigenetic modulation of allogeneic NK cells by the HDAC inhibitor MS-275 will improve tumor trafficking and enhance therapeutic efficacy against osteosarcoma (OS) lung metastases. Human NK cells were purified and expanded from donor buffy coats using recombinant human IL-2 and genetically engineered K562 feeder cells and treated with MS-275 before injection into mice. RNA seq was performed in untreated and MS-275 pre-treated NK cells to determine differentially expressed genes. We also used ChiPseq to determine the histone post-translational modifications associated with the differentially expressed genes induced by the treatment. Culture media from untreated and treated NK cells was collected for cytokine analysis using the Isolight\/Isoplexis system. We used our OS-17 human OS experimental lung metastases mouse model and injected untreated or pre-treated NK cells (0.5uM MS-275) IV labeled with near-infrared DiR dye twice a week. Tumor burden was assessed, and NK cells were tracked by Bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Mice were either euthanized 24 hours after the final NK cell treatment for histologic analysis of the lungs or, in a second experiment, analyzed for survival across treatment groups. Some mice from each group were selected for 3D imaging using the Xerra cryofluorescence tomography (CFT) imaging system, allowing for greater resolution of NK cell distribution as compared to the IVIS imaging system. We identified 547 differentially expressed genes between the untreated and MS-275 treated NK cells. Four immune related genes (L1CAM, IFNG, C3 and CD28) were upregulated in the MS-275 treated NK cells and histone H3 and H4 acetylation was found at the identified immunomodulatory genes. Culture media from MS-275 treated NK cells showed significantly increased MIP-1b, IL-6 and IFN-g. Furthermore, there was a significant decrease in lung micro-metastases in the MS-275 pre-treated NK cell group as compared to the untreated control group (199 vs 97 p=0.05). Lastly, Xerra CFT imaging demonstrated greater DiR signal in the lungs of the mice that received MS-275 treated NK cells compared to those that received untreated NK cells, suggesting that MS-275 might lead to greater persistence of NK cells at tumor sites. <b><\/b> We conclude that MS-275 has an immunomodulatory effect on NK cells (increase L1CAM, IFNG, C3 and CD28) and increases H3 and H4 acetylation which leads to transcriptional activation of the immune-related genes that contribute to NK cell increased cytolytic function. Pre-treatment of NK cells with MS-275 enhances NK cell therapeutic efficacy and localization and persistence in the lungs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,HDAC inhibitor,Osteosarcoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ariana Rupp Anjier<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nancy Gordon<sup>2<\/sup>, Shinji Maegawa<sup>2<\/sup>, Vidya Gopalakrishnan<sup>2<\/sup>, Juan Bournat<sup>2<\/sup>, Donghang Cheng<sup>2<\/sup>, Yanwen Yang<sup>2<\/sup>, Charles Kingsley<sup>2<\/sup>, Adam Kulp<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Biology, University of Louisiana At Lafayette, Lafayette, LA,<sup>2<\/sup>Pediatric Research, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cee5b33d-c7a1-44c9-9a4f-7880e3030214","ControlNumber":"3770","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Engineered, off-the-shelf, allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells are particularly attractive as cell therapies for solid tumors given their clinical safety, efficacy, and multimodal recognition of tumor cells.<br \/>We describe here the pre-clinical pharmacokinetics, efficacy, biodistribution and safety of CAT-179, a novel allogeneic, cryopreserved CAR-NK cell therapy, in na&#239;ve animals as well as multiple xenograft models of HER2-amplified ovarian and gastric cancer. CAT-179 cells are engineered to express an optimized HER2-directed CAR to effectively target tumor cells, a transforming growth factor b (TGF&#946;) dominant negative receptor (DNR) to protect against TGF&#946;-mediated immunosuppression, and interleukin-15 (IL-15) to enhance NK cell persistence.<br \/>A single intravenous (IV) dose of CAT-179 resulted in IL-15-dependent (p&#60;0.0001) expansion and persistence of CAT-179 cells for at least 140 days in NOD-scid IL2Rgnull (NSG) mice, peaking at approximately 15,000 cells\/&#181;L of blood (by day 60). Persisting CAT-179 NK cell levels at day 60 were functionally active and significantly reduced tumor burden when challenged intraperitoneally (IP) with HER2+ SKOV3-luc tumor cells. No significant changes in body weight or condition were observed during this study.<br \/>The therapeutic anti-tumor activity of CAT-179 against established tumors was assayed using two different xenograft models. In the first model, NSG mice were given an IP dose of 1 million SKOV3-luc tumor cells (derived from ovarian cancer) followed by either 4 million CAT-179 or control NK cells on days 4, 11 and 18. CAT-179 dosed animals showed a rapid and sustained 95% decline in tumor burden (p&#60;0.0001) and a significant extension in survival relative to animals dosed with control NK cells (p&#60;0.0001). In the second model, 1 million HER2+ N87 cancer cells (derived from gastric cancer) were implanted subcutaneously into the right flank of NSG mice. When tumors reached 70mm3, a single IV dose of 2M CAT-179 or control NK cells was administered. CAT-179 dosed animals showed a 96% durable tumor regression and significant survival benefit relative to animals dosed with control NK cells (p&#60;0.0001). Efficacy strongly correlated with the circulating levels of CAT-179, which significantly infiltrated the tumor xenograft. Our pre-clinical results demonstrate the potential of CAT-179 as a novel, durable, and off-the-shelf cell therapy to overcome the challenges associated with solid tumors and provide quantitative insights into pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and anti-tumor activity of engineered NK cells expressing CAR, TGFb DNR and IL-15.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,HER2,Chimeric antigen receptor,TGF-&#946;,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Bashar Hamza<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Angela Nunez<sup><\/sup>, Marilyn Marques<sup><\/sup>, Alexia Barandiaran<sup><\/sup>, Henry Moreno<sup><\/sup>, Finola Moore<sup><\/sup>, Meghan Walsh<sup><\/sup>, Eugene Choi<sup><\/sup>, Kisha Pradhan<sup><\/sup>, Krista Daniel<sup><\/sup>, Jennifer Johnson<sup><\/sup>, Charlotte Franco<sup><\/sup>, Andres Alvarez<sup><\/sup>, Karl Malakian<sup><\/sup>, Keith H.

SENTI-301A also showed significantly higher in vitro cytotoxic activity (~20%) against GPC3 expressing cell lines compared to isogenic cells lacking the antigen, indicating CAR-mediated activation and antigen specificity. SENTI-301A also showed significant tumor killing function, IFNg, and Granzyme-B production, when co-cultured with HCC and other GPC3 expressing tumor cell lines at different effector:target ratios. SENTI-301A maintained the antitumor function in the presence of full-length soluble GPC3, reducing the risk of competition from shedding GPC3 with surface GPC3 for CAR-NK cell binding. In HCC mouse xenograft models, SENTI-301A showed NK cells tumor infiltration, and displayed enhanced persistence, antitumor function and increased median survival (p&#38;lt; 0.01), in comparison to unengineered NK cells. As next steps, the potential positive impact of immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) in combination with SENTI-301A to enhance anticancer function is being assessed.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>SENTI-301A is a novel off-the-shelf preclinical CAR-NK cell therapy candidate that targets GPC3-expressing tumors in an antigen-specific manner and exhibits increased persistence via crIL-15. We are exploring the potential synergy between SENTI-301A and CPIs to enhance the existing antitumor functions of SENTI-301A. SENTI-301A is planned for clinical development with an investigational new drug application (IND) expected in 2023.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Liver cancer,Immunotherapy,CAR-NK,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Marcela Guzman Ayala<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Deepika Kaveri<sup><\/sup>, Enping Hong<sup><\/sup>, Elizabeth Leitner<sup><\/sup>, Priscilla Wong<sup><\/sup>, Ronni Ponek<sup><\/sup>, Lawrence Naitmazi<sup><\/sup>, Pearley Chinta<sup><\/sup>, Wesley Gorman<sup><\/sup>, Mengxi Tian<sup><\/sup>, Niran Almudhfar<sup><\/sup>, Kelly Lee<sup><\/sup>, Nicholas Frankel<sup><\/sup>, Alba Gonzalez Junca<sup><\/sup>, Russell Gordley<sup><\/sup>, Philip Lee<sup><\/sup>, Timothy Lu<sup><\/sup>, Kanya Rajangam<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Senti Biosciences, Inc, South San Francisco, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"fc448f13-4d68-4306-8585-8b2f16fc9520","ControlNumber":"5424","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

Natural killer (NK) cells are a promising cellular therapy for T cell-refractory cancers, but are frequently dysfunctional in patients with HNC. New strategies are needed to enhance NK cell responses against HNC. Activation of NK cells with IL-12, 15 and 18 results in memory-like (ML) differentiation improving NK cell responses in hematological malignancies. We hypothesized that ML NK cell differentiation, tumor targeting with cetuximab, and engineering with &#945;-ephA2 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) would enhance NK cell responses against HNC.<br \/>Methods: ML NK and conventional (c) NK cells were generated from healthy donors (HD) and evaluated for their ability to produce IFN&#947;, TNF, degranulate (CD107a) and kill HNC cell lines and primary HNC cells alone or in combination with cetuximab&#8239;in vitro<i>&#8239;<\/i>and in xenograft models. To identify activating receptors involved in NK cell recognition of HNC, blocking experiments were used. ML and cNK cells were engineered to express &#945;-EphA2 CAR-CD8A-41BB-CD3z and functional responses were assessed in vitro against HNC cell lines and primary HNC targets.<br \/>Results: ML NK cells generated from HD displayed enhanced IFN&#947; response compared to cNK cells against HNC cell lines SCC1(11&#177;2% vs. 24&#177;1%, mean &#177; SEM p&#60;0.001), SCC47 (13&#177;2% vs. 36&#177;2%, p&#60;0.01) and primary HNC targets (17&#177;2% vs. 32&#177;3%, p&#60;0.01) which were further enhanced by cetuximab, SCC1 (cNK + cetuximab vs. ML + cetuximab 16&#177;2% vs. 28&#177;3%, p&#60;0.001), SCC47 (39&#177;3% vs. 56&#177;2%, p&#60;0.001), primary HNC targets (23&#177;2% vs. 40&#177;2%, p&#60;0.0001). The combination of ML NK cells and cetuximab was superior to cNK and cetuximab in <sup>51 <\/sup>Cr release assay and IncuCyte&#174; killing assays for HNC cell lines (p&#60;0.01) and primary cells (p&#60;0.01). Findings were consistent in SCC1 HNC xenograft model, where tumor bearing NSG mice treated with cetuximab and ML NK cells had significantly lower tumor burden at 21 days compared to untreated mice, mice that received cNK cells + cetuximab or cetuximab only (p&#60;0.001). Mechanistically, NK cell IFN&#947;, CD107a and cytotoxicity against HNC targets is partially dependent on activating receptors NKG2D, CD2 and DNAM-1. ML NK cells expressing &#945;-ephA2 CAR were specific to ephA2+ cell lines and demonstrated increased IFN&#947; (37&#177;4% vs. 16&#177;3%, p&#60;0.001) and CD107a (36&#177;4% vs. 20&#177;1%, p&#60;0.001) against NK resistant ephA2+ UD-SCC2, compared to CAR negative cells. EphA2 CAR ML NK cells had increased CD107a (26&#177;4% vs. 39&#177;4%, p&#60;0.01) and IFN&#947; (45&#177;5% vs. 66&#177;3%, p&#60;0.001) against primary ephA2+ HNC targets.<br \/>Conclusion: These pre-clinical findings show that ML differentiation alone or in concert with cetuximab directed targeting or ephA2 CAR engineering, was effective against HNC and provide the rationale for investigation in early phase clinical trials for HNC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Chimeric antigen receptor,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,EphA2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Miriam T.

CAR natural killer (CAR-NK) cells are rapidly emerging as a promising alternative cellular therapeutic with improved efficacy and reduced adverse effects. Moreover, due to the intrinsic characteristics of NK cells, whereby they lack antigen-specific cell surface receptors, CAR-NK cells offer the additional advantage of being an &#8220;off-the-shelf&#8221; product, thus satisfying the requirement for large-scale production for cancer immunotherapy, giving it the potential to reach more patients at a reduced cost. Here we outline the method to generate, expand and enrich human primary CD19 CAR-NK cells, and demonstrate their efficacy <i>in-vitro<\/i> against CD19-expressing target cancer cells. Human primary NK cells were isolated from healthy donors and transduced with a clinically tested CD19-targeting CAR lentiviral vector (LV) or GFP expressing LV, as an empty vector transduced control. Transduction efficiency greater than 10% or 20% was achieved following transduction and expansion over a 7-day period in response to CD19 CAR LV or GFP LV respectively. Following sufficient expansion, cytotoxicity of the CD19 CAR-NK cells was tested <i>in-vitro<\/i> in a Tumor Killing Assay (TKA) against CD19+ (Raji) or CD19- (SKOV-3) target cells. As expected, CD19 CAR-NK cells displayed increased cytotoxicity towards CD19+ target cells when compared to non-transduced or GFP transduced controls. This effect was not observed with CD19 negative cancer cells, strongly suggesting specific CD19 CAR mediated killing. Moreover, CD19 CAR-NK cells showed increased degranulation and IFN&#42857; secretion when compared to both non-transduced and GFP-transduced controls, suggesting increased NK cell activation and cytotoxicity. Additionally, when degranulation of CD19 CAR positive and CD19 CAR negative NK populations was directly compared, the level of NK cell degranulation was analogous between the two populations, suggesting that CD19 CAR NK cells can enhance the cytotoxic activity of neighboring non-transduced cells, resulting in enhanced killing of CD19+ target cells by the total NK population present. Taken together these data demonstrate the generation, expansion and enrichment of CD19 CAR-NK cells with enhanced cytotoxic activity towards CD19+ target cells. This culture system provides the scientific community a platform to screen novel CAR-constructs and to test novel immunomodulators which could enhance NK cell expansion or functional potential to further develop new, more widely available cellular therapeutics to treat cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive cell therapy,Natural killer cells,Chimeric antigen receptor,Tumor immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Karina Di Gregoli<sup>1<\/sup>, Ravindra Mode<sup>1<\/sup>, Kaitlin Mitchell<sup>1<\/sup>, David Cobeta-Lopez<sup>2<\/sup>, Sabrina de Munnik<sup>2<\/sup>, Rene McLaughlin<sup>2<\/sup>, Gemma Moiset<sup>2<\/sup>, Louise Brackenbury<sup>1<\/sup>, Lauren Schewitz-Bowers<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Robert Nunan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Bristol, United Kingdom,<sup>2<\/sup>Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Leiden, Netherlands","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"90d6fc39-9124-4cc2-b1c8-6b74e9659b64","ControlNumber":"6496","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;K.

T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) is a major inhibitory receptor of both T cells and NK cells and is an emerging target for immune checkpoint blockade for the treatment of cancer. Although preclinical studies using combinations of anti-TIGIT and anti-PD-(L)1 showed promising results, the phase III SKYSCRAPER-01 trial using the combination of tiragolumab and atezolizumab for NSCLC did not meet its co-primary endpoint of progression free survival (PFS) while the overall survival (OS) at the time of this publication was immature with the study still ongoing. There is critical need to further understand the mechanism of function of TIGIT on immune cells to support its clinical use. Most of the current understanding of TIGIT regulation of immune cell function has been based on T cells, despite comparable or higher TIGIT expression on NK cells. Recent murine studies have shown the therapeutic efficacy of PD-1 and TIGIT blockade depended on the presence of NK cells, indicating they are an important immune population to consider in the efficacy of TIGIT blockade treatments. Furthermore, the majority of TIGIT antibodies have a humanized IgG, which binds to Fc receptors (CD16) and induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), a major contributor to their efficacy. Since both CD16 and TIGIT are highly expressed on activated NK cells, there is a potential for ADCC-driven fratricide of TIGIT<sup>+<\/sup> NK cells with ADCC-competent anti-TIGIT. In this study, TIGIT knockout was performed in <i>ex vivo<\/i>-expanded primary human NK cells and anti-tumor response measured. Compared to WT NK cells, TIGIT knockout NK cells had improved <i>in vitro<\/i> killing of 3D lung cancer spheroids and increased ADCC when combined with cetuximab. TIGIT KO NK cells had upregulated mTORC1 signaling, increased basal glycolytic rate, and increased degranulation. Moreover, fratricide of WT NK cells was observed in the presence of ADCC-competent anti-TIGIT and could be ameliorated by TIGIT knockout. Altogether, this study demonstrated that the highly cytotoxic fratricide resistant TIGIT knockout NK cells have translation potential alone or in combination with ADCC-competent anti-TIGIT antibodies to enhance the efficacy of anti-TIGIT therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TIGIT,Natural killer cells,Adoptive cell therapy,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Md Faqrul Hasan<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Tayler  J.

Neuroblastoma and other peripheral nervous cell tumors account for 6% of all pediatric cancer. While the 5-year survival rate has greatly improved, the prognosis of children with high-risk neuroblastoma at diagnosis is less than 50%. Immune checkpoint therapy is a promising new application for pediatric oncology; however, neuroblastoma is often immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; and current immune checkpoint targets are not abundant in pediatric solid tumors. To improve response to checkpoint blockade and directly target tumor cells for elimination, this study evaluated the use of NK cells. NK cells prime the immune system for successful response to cancer immunotherapy. NK cells activated with particle technology (PM21-NK cells) are highly cytotoxic, produce IFN&#947; and induce PD-L1 on cancer cells. Although highly cytotoxic, PM21-NK cells express inhibitory receptors that compete for ligands that trigger NK cell lysis, such as PVR, a ligand highly expressed on neuroblastoma cells. We knocked out expression of multiple PVR inhibitory receptors in PM21-NK cells to further enhance cytotoxicity and prevent exhaustion. Three inhibitory receptors on NK cells that bind PVR - TIGIT, CD96, and PVRIG were knocked out alone or in combination and effector functions of these edited NK cells tested. Cytotoxicity against 3D spheroids of the neuroblastoma cell line SK-NA-S cells was assessed and compared to wild type PM21-NK cells. Knockout (KO) of TIGIT enhanced NK cell killing compared to wildtype NK cells (72%&#177;10 vs 55%&#177;3% killing) as well as PVIRG KO (84&#177;3% vs 46&#177;6% killing) and CD96 KO (62%&#177;9% vs 46&#177;6% killing) at a 1:3 E:T ratio at 72 h. Double or triple KO of these receptors resulted in further increased killing of cancer cells. The knockouts of each of the receptors could affect cytokine production and cytokine responsiveness and this will be examined.

One mechanism employed by tumor cells to evade immunosurveillance is through induction of the surface expression of unconventional HLA ligands that agonize inhibitory receptors on immune cells. Specifically on some tumors, HLA-E is either expressed or its expression is known to be induced by IFN&#947; and is indicative of resistance to immunotherapy. HLA-E agonizes the CD94\/NKG2A inhibitory complex on NK cells and some T cells to lessen their cytotoxicity, potentially decreasing the efficacy of cellular therapy with these immune cells. In this study<i> ex vivo<\/i>-expanded primary human NK cells were shown to have significantly elevated expression of NKG2A. These expanded NK cells also secreted high levels of IFN&#947; and could induce expression of HLA-E on tumor cells. Suppression of NKG2A by either antibody blockade or gene deletion increased the cytotoxicity of NK cells against the lung cancer cell line A549 stably expressing HLA-E. NKG2A knockout cells had an almost 10-fold decrease in EC<sub>50<\/sub> compared to wild-type NK cells (EC<sub>50<\/sub> 0.15 vs 0.94 at 48 h), meaning nearly log-fold fewer NKG2A knockout cells are needed to kill the same number of tumor cells. The effect of NKG2A knockout on cytotoxicity of NK cells against other cancer cell lines stably expressing HLA-E will be presented along with effects of NKG2A suppression on NK cell phenotype, cytokine secretion and degranulation. These initial data suggest that blockade of the CD94\/NKG2A inhibitory complex can improve the function of <i>ex vivo<\/i> expanded human NK cells and could provide an effector population with the potential for enhanced therapeutic efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Adoptive cell therapy,Immune checkpoint blockade,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tayler  J.

However, CAR NK cells in solid tumors have had limited success and considerable efforts are being undertaken to improve their efficacy and persistence. Designing optimal CAR transmembrane and intracellular endodomains may increase expression, strength of activation, co-localization within synapses, and improve functional outcomes. First generation NK CARs had CD8&#593; or CD28 transmembrane domains, similar to CAR T cells. They also included endodomain combinations of CD3&#950;, CD28, and 4-1BB, while subsequent generations included combinations of NKG2D, DNAM-1, and 2B4 endodomains, with the intent of incorporating NK-specific activation signals.<br \/>To identify optimal design sequences for NK-based CARs, we developed an in vitro screening platform based on the functional attributes of NK cells, cytotoxicity and persistence. We designed and synthesized two CAR libraries comprising ~2,700 and ~1,300 endodomains drawn from pairwise combinations of 52 and 36 co-stimulatory motifs, respectively. Through a pooled screening experiment, we identified multiple signaling domains that improved the persistence of NK cells in low cytokine conditions throughout two weeks of re-stimulation. Isolated lines of NK cells expressing the top hits demonstrated higher cytotoxicity both immediately after transfection and after two weeks of re-stimulation with tumor cell lines, validating their improved therapeutic potential. We additionally trained a machine learning model using the counts of signaling domain-binding motifs as features to predict the cytotoxicity and persistence of the screened endodomains. This discriminator model and the feature importance can be used to recommend novel co-stimulatory motif combinations for future screens.<br \/>Top hits in these screens included co-stimulatory domains known to enhance proliferation, cytotoxicity, and tumor clearance in animal models and commonly used in CAR T cell therapies. We frequently observed these domains in novel combinations or in combination with other endodomains not presently used in CAR T therapies. Additionally, we identified transmembrane domains derived from NK surface receptors that increased the presentation of CAR on the NK cell surface. We subsequently integrated these transmembrane domains with hits from our endodomain screen and again used re-stimulation and cytotoxicity assays to functionally test potentially positive interactions between transmembrane domains and endodomains in CAR-NKs. These screening data are ideal for developing predictive models endodomain combinations that enhance NK cell cytotoxicity and persistence. Our results suggest that this approach can be used to identify CAR structural components tailored to cell type, binder specificity, and tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Chimeric antigen receptor,Solid tumors,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maddie Williams<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Aye Chen<sup><\/sup>, Matt Stone<sup><\/sup>, Rebekah Turk<sup><\/sup>, Nora Kearns<sup><\/sup>, Nick Bogard<sup><\/sup>, Lan Guo<sup><\/sup>, Brian Belmont<sup><\/sup>, Mary  H.

Existing oncology drugs may enhance the anti-cancer function of NK cells, although large-scale high-throughput testing of NK cell-drug combinations has not been previously attempted. Our objective was to evaluate the potential of approved and investigational oncology drugs to synergize with NK cell-based immunotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with the aim to discover both potentiating and inhibiting compounds.<br \/>Methods: A high-throughput drug sensitivity and resistance screen including 528 oncology drugs was combined with expanded NK cells to evaluate their cytotoxicity against luciferase-expressing AML cells (MOLM-14). The most prominent drugs were investigated further with single-cell RNA sequencing to reveal underlying biological mechanisms.<br \/>Results: Overall, 191 drugs had an inhibitory effect on cytotoxicity, 294 had no effect, and 43 had an enhancing effect. The most notable NK cell cytotoxicity-potentiating drugs were pevonedistat (NEDD8 inhibitor), daporinad (NAMPT inhibitor), and JAK inhibitors. These drugs also induced distinct changes in NK and target cell transcriptional profiles. When combined with NK cells, pevonedistat and daporinad induced an upregulation of <i>HLA-E<\/i> and <i>CXCL10<\/i> in target cells. In addition, <i>MYC<\/i> and <i>FLT3<\/i> proto-oncogenes were downregulated in target cells when combining NK cells with pevonedistat. Moreover, in NK cells, daporinad induced dysregulated expression of genes related to NK cell effector functions such as <i>TYROBP<\/i>, <i>TXNIP<\/i> and <i>KLRC1<\/i>. Treatment with JAK inhibitors downregulated MHC I expression on target cells, providing a putative mechanism for increased NK cell activity. Validation of key hits is ongoing in additional AML cell lines.<br \/>Conclusion: We discovered novel drugs with both potentiating and inhibiting effects on NK cell cytotoxicity against AML cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. Our results demonstrate the potential of using a high-throughput framework for studying NK cell-drug interactions against malignant cells, while aiming to improve treatment for AML and other malignancies through combination immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adoptive immunotherapy,Natural killer cells,Combination therapy,Acute myeloid leukemia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jonas  O.

It incorporates six gene edits. A CAR targeting CD19 mediates tumor cell engagement and killing, the homeostatic cytokine IL-15 improves functional persistence, and EGFR acts as a safety switch, providing an antibody target for elimination of the engineered cells, if ever necessary. Further edits are designed to reduce graft rejection due to alloreactivity, including disruption of beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) to prevent major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) surface expression, disruption of class II major histocompatibility complex transactivator (CIITA), and expression of HLA-E fused with B2M. Our data indicate that iPSC lines show significant functional variability dependent on the original somatic cell and donor used for reprogramming. Additional functional variability is induced when the iPSC are genetically edited and differentiated to NK cells. This complexity necessitates careful methodology for nominating clinical candidate clones with desirable functional attributes and presents an opportunity for future refinement. Here, we evaluate 28 clinical candidate clones for CNTY-101, integrating in-process data from genetic engineering, differentiation, and a battery of functional assays into a unified analysis framework. We find that the donor and the number of integrated transgene alleles (ex. monoallelic vs biallelic) have a large impact on clone function. <i>In silico<\/i> correction for donor and allele number reveals that transgene surface expression correlates with functions including short-term killing, serial-killing, and persistence. We show that IL-15 transgene expression, serial-killing, and persistence correlate along one functional axis, while CAR expression, short-term killing, and cytokine secretion correlate on a second functional axis. In addition, we identify biomarkers measured during the differentiation process that are correlated with functional performance, such as the level of CD94 surface expression and tumor killing. Finally, we discuss the application of functional multi-omics to candidate clone nomination for Century Therapeutics&#8217; pipeline of future products.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Stem cells,CAR-NK cell,Adoptive cell therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Matthew  S.

In this study, we found that intratumoral delivery of NK cells significantly attains therapeutic effects only if co-injected with anti-NKG2A and anti-Qa1b blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in two solid mouse tumors models. Such therapeutic activity was contingent on endogenous CD8 T cells and on type-1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1), which mediate cross-priming of tumor antigens. Moreover, the anti-tumor effects can be enhanced upon combination with anti-PD-1 mAb. This combination achieves at least partial abscopal efficacy against distant untreated tumors. In xenografted mice with HLA-E-expressing human cancer cells, intratumoral co-injection of allogeneic human NK cells and the clinical-grade anti-NKG2A mAb monalizumab synergistically achieved therapeutic effects and gave rise to stronger antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in conjunction with cetuximab.

We showed efficient encapsulation of BCMA and CD19-CAR RNA into LNP that resulted in up to 99% expression of CAR+ CD56+ NK cells after transfection. The BCMA-CAR-NK cells more effectively than NK cells killed MM1S, H929 and RPMI8226 multiple myeloma cells and secreted IFN-gamma in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, frozen BCMA-CAR-NK cells were viable and expressed similar cytotoxic activity to not frozen expanded CAR-NK cells. In addition, frozen-thawed BCMA-CAR-NK cells showed 93% CAR expression at 24 hours post-thaw which remained &#62;70% at 48 hours post-thaw. In a similar way, CD19-CAR-NK cells generated with CD19-CAR-LNP killed CD19-positive Raji and Daudi target cells and secreted high level of IFN-gamma. This, frozen\/thawed CAR-NK cells demonstrated high <i>in vitro<\/i> cytotoxic activity against target cells. Manufacturing of NK cells using G-Rex system resulted in 1862-fold expansion at day 13 and 2450-fold expansion of 97% CD56+ NK cells at day 14. Transfection of BCMA-CAR RNA-LNP into 13 day expanded NK cells resulted in 95% BCMA-CAR-NK positive cells. Thus, CAR-NK cells generated with RNA-LNP technology can be used in future pre-clinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Nanoparticle,RNA,BCMA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Vita M.

In these studies, direct administration of a new LV encoding a CD19 CAR into humanized NOD SCID gamma (NSG) mice expressing human IL-3, GM-CSF, and SCF (NSG-SGM3) resulted in a dose-dependent elimination of B cells in the peripheral blood, peritoneal fluid, bone marrow, and tissue of treated mice.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> CD3-directed LV encoding a CD19 CAR with a novel synthetic driver element was manufactured utilizing a 25L clinical scale suspension-based process. NSG-SGM3 mice transplanted with human CD34+ cells from cord blood were injected with LV doses (1E6 IU, 1E7 IU, or 5E7 IU) intraperitoneally (IP) or 1E7 IU intravenously (IV). Quantification of CD19 CAR+ cells and CD20+ B cells in peripheral blood, peritoneal fluid, and bone marrow was assessed by flow cytometry. Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis was performed to evaluate the tissue-resident human B cells and for any other histopathological observations following test article administration.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>All CD34+ humanized NSG-SGM3 mice were confirmed to exhibit efficient human hematopoietic engraftment by flow cytometry prior to test article administration (peripheral blood hCD45: 68.9% &#177; 4.93%; hCD19+ B cells: 53.7% &#177; 5.11%).

Both IP and IV routes of administration showed significant B cell depletion at the 1E7 IU dose. However, complete B cell elimination in splenic tissue was only observed at the 5E7 IU dose. Non-treated CD34+ humanized NSG-SGM3 mice exhibited hepatic portal inflammation and moderate graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the colon.

NK cells are self-tolerant to healthy cells and can kill tumor cells in both hematological and solid malignancies. Recent advances allow for the derivation of immune cells such as NK cells, from human induced pluripotent stem cells, that can be utilized for cancer immunotherapy. Recent clinical trials suggest that high doses of NK cells (approx. 0.5-5 x 10<sup>9Jaya<\/sup> cells per dose) and multiple doses are both safe and likely necessary for clinical efficacy. Manufacturing large number of NK cells from a clonal master iPSC line provides a promising strategy to enable next generation, off-the-shelf, affordable, cancer immunotherapies. We have developed a novel method to produce high purity, clinical scale iNK cells and improved the process for the expansion of NK cells efficiently and consistently. This method does not require cell sorting step and the usage of murine derived stromal cells. Briefly, hematopoietic progenitor cells were induced using an improved spin embryoid body (EB) method and the hematopoietic progenitor cells were subsequently differentiated into mature iNK cells in the absence of cell sorting and independent of stroma cells support. Using this novel method, differentiated NK cells could be expanded more than 8,000-fold to enable us to potentially produce 1 x 10<sup>12<\/sup> iNK cells starting from 1 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> undifferentiated iPSC. This cell production scale can supply hundreds of doses in clinic from one cGMP manufacturing campaign. iNK cells produced using this method display the typical phenotype of NK cell activating receptor including NKG2D, NKp44, NKp46, DNAM-1 etc. Importantly, these iNK cells demonstrate better anti-tumor activities and higher levels of IFN&#947; and TNF&#945;, compared to primary peripheral blood-derived NK cells isolated from healthy donors. Moreover, this protocol has been adapted and optimized for clinical scale manufacturing of iNK cells from genetically engineered, clonal master iPSC cell line with knock out of <i>CISH<\/i> (<i>CISH<\/i> KO iNK), a key intracellular checkpoint of NK cell anti-tumor immunity. <i>CISH<\/i> KO iNK cells produced using this optimized method show significantly better anti-tumor activities against multiple liquid and solid tumor cell lines including K562, Raji, Daudi, SUP-B15, MOLT-4, SKOV-3, OVCAR-4, HCC-827, ZR-75, and BT-474 etc. in vitro and in vivo in an AML xenograft mouse model, compared with unmodified iNK cells. Overall, this novel cell production strategy paves the way for clinical trials using higher doses of iPSC-derived NK cells with increased potency, creating next-generation NK cell-based immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-06 Stem cells and regenerative medicine in oncology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Natural killer cells,Adoptive cell therapy,Immuno-oncology,Stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Davide Bernareggi<sup>1<\/sup>, Caryn Gonsalves<sup>1<\/sup>, Max Schabla<sup>1<\/sup>, Alejandra Gárate-Carrillo<sup>1<\/sup>, Duygu Ozmadenci<sup>1<\/sup>, Jaya Thangaraj<sup>2<\/sup>, Qin Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Leah Mitchell<sup>1<\/sup>, Dan  S.
