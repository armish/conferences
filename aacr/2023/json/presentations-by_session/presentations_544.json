The protein tyrosine kinases that carry this out are dysregulated in a variety of cancers and are the targets of efficacious drugs. For most tyrosine kinases, we have a very limited understanding of their downstream signaling pathways and phosphorylation targets. Conversely, thousands of tyrosine phosphorylation events have so far been experimentally identified, and the overwhelming majority of these do not have an associated kinase. In this work, we have utilized peptide arrays to determine the substrate sequence specificity for the human tyrosine kinome, comprising 46 receptor tyrosine kinases, 32 nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, and 14 noncanonical tyrosine kinases. Nearly every kinase we profiled favored tyrosines that were positioned next to phosphorylated amino acids, indicating that PTM priming and crosstalk are general properties of the tyrosine kinome. Comparisons with <i>C. elegans<\/i> orthologs suggested that tyrosine kinase substrate motifs have remained conserved throughout metazoan evolution. When we computationally utilized our dataset to identify kinases for tyrosine substrates, our predictions were in strong accordance with published reports. When applied to high-throughput tyrosine phosphoproteomics datasets, we could decipher the kinases involved in cellular responses to growth factors, oncogenic mutations, and targeted inhibitors. Together, this work uncovers fundamental rules of substrate selection for nearly the entire human tyrosine kinome and provides a comprehensive resource for connecting tyrosine phosphorylation events with their kinases and signaling pathways.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-05 Kinases and phosphatases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinases,Phosphorylation,Signaling,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jared  L.

Somatic hotspot mutations and structural amplifications and fusions affecting fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (<i>FGFR2<\/i>) likewise occur in multiple tumor types including breast cancer. However, clinical responses to FGFR inhibitors have remained variable, emphasizing a need to better understand which <i>FGFR2<\/i> alterations are oncogenic and therapeutically targetable. We applied transposon-based screening and tumor modelling in the mouse mammary gland to uncover truncation of the last exon (E18) of <i>Fgfr2<\/i> as a potent driver mutation. Mouse and human <i>FGFR2<\/i>-E18 encodes the C-terminus of this RTK. Human oncogenomic datasets revealed a plethora of somatic <i>FGFR2 <\/i>alterations potentially causing transcription of E18-truncated <i>FGFR2<\/i>. These alterations were comprised of canonical in-frame fusions as well as diverse <i>FGFR2 <\/i>variants of unknown significance (VUS), which included non-canonical rearrangements, E1-E17 partial amplifications, and E18 nonsense and frameshift mutations. Functional <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> interrogation of a compendium of E18-truncated and full-length <i>FGFR2<\/i> variants pinpointed <i>FGFR2-<\/i>E18 truncation as single-driver alteration in cancer. In contrast, the oncogenic competence of <i>FGFR2<\/i> full-length amplifications depended on a distinct cooperating driver gene landscape. Notably, gradual truncation and site-directed mutagenesis of <i>Fgfr2<\/i>-E18 identified a novel 2-amino-acid motif within the C-terminus critical for kinase domain binding and suppression of oncogenic FGFR2 signaling. Aberration of this motif conspired with the loss of the receptor internalization motif to fully phenocopy oncogenicity of E18-truncated <i>Fgfr2<\/i>. These data suggest that genomic alterations that generate stable E18-truncated <i>FGFR2<\/i> variants are actionable therapeutic targets, which we confirmed in preclinical mouse and human tumor models, and in a clinical trial. Thus, we uncovered a novel paradigm in oncogenic FGFR2 signaling and propose that breast and other cancers harboring any <i>FGFR2<\/i> variant that truncates E18 should be considered for FGFR-targeted therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-06 Receptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2  (FGFR-2),Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI),Gene fusion,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Daniel Kaspar Zingg<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jinhyuk Bhin<sup>1<\/sup>, Julia Yemelyanenko<sup>1<\/sup>, Sjors M.

Our recent publication reported TNK1 as the primary kinase driver of cell survival in subsets of patient blood cancer samples. In an effort to understand TNK1 function and regulation, we discovered that it has an unusual C-terminal ubiquitin-association (UBA) domain that binds with high affinity to multiple poly-ubiquitin linkages. A 1.5 angstrom crystal structure of the TNK1 UBA shows an atypical five helix UBA domain with two ubiquitin-binding interfaces. Our data suggest that TNK1 relies on its UBA domain to localize to phase-separated ubiquitin-rich condensates and becomes fully active at these sites. To our knowledge, this feature of TNK1 (a bona-fide ubiquitin-association domain that promotes kinase activation) makes TNK1 unique across the human kinome. We also show that the phospho-binding protein 14-3-3 interacts with a MARK-mediated phosphorylation at S502 within the proline-rich domain of TNK1 to sequester TNK1 away from ubiquitin condensates and inhibit kinase activation. In this way, TNK1 toggles between poly-ubiquitin bound (active) and 14-3-3-bound (inactive) states. Our preliminary data suggest that the interaction with poly-ubiquitin at condensates tethers TNK1 to substrates involved in the lysosomal degradation of the condensates via aggrephagy. Furthermore, we found that patient mutations that truncate the 14-3-3 binding site and UBA domain convert TNK1 into a cancer driver with an altered substrate profile, skewed toward pro-growth substrates like STAT3. Finally, we show that mutant TNK1-driven tumors can be targeted in vivo with an anti-TNK1 small molecule. Together, our data provide a first mechanism of regulation and role for TNK1 as a ubiquitin sensor and implicate TNK1 as a candidate for targeted cancer therapy.<br \/>1.

Muscle and bone loss are amongst the most detrimental symptoms of cachexia and directly cause increased morbidity and mortality. We and others have shown that CRC also promotes metabolic and genomic perturbations of the liver, and further, that formation of LMs exacerbates muscle and bone wasting. These observations, along with evidence that liver-derived factors (i.e., hepatokines) may poorly influence musculoskeletal health, suggest an endocrine role of the liver in mediating cancer-induced cachexia. In the present study, we identified the hepatokine insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) as a novel mediator of musculoskeletal wasting in CRC. Plasma from CRC patients and preclinical mouse models of CRC (C26, MC38, HCT116, Apc<sup>Min\/+<\/sup>) were assessed for circulating IGFBP1 levels. AML12 hepatocytes were cultured with CRC cells (C26, MC38, HCT116) to assess tumor induced hepatic IGFBP1 production, while C2C12 myotubes and osteoclast precursor cells were cultured to examine the <i>in vitro<\/i> effects of IGFBP1 on myotube atrophy and osteoclastogenesis. 8-week-old male wild-type (WT) C57BL\/6J and IGFBP1-KO mice were intrasplenically injected with MC38 tumor cells (mMC38) to mimic hepatic dissemination of cancer cells, while sham-operated animals received saline. Animals were assessed for muscle force 24-hours prior to euthanasia, and skeletal muscles and bone were collected for molecular and morphological analyses. CRC patients and CRC tumor-bearing mice demonstrated markedly elevated circulating plasma IGFBP1, also supported by increased liver IGFBP1 mRNA expression in C26, MC38 and HCT116 hosts. Follow-up <i>in vitro<\/i> studies demonstrated that co-culturing CRC cells (lacking IGFBP1 expression) with AML12 hepatocytes promotes IGFBP1 production, thereby suggesting that IGFBP1 is purely host-derived. Further, treatment with recombinant IGFBP1 was sufficient to stimulate osteoclastogenesis, while also promoting atrophy of C2C12 myotubes. Conversely, use of anti-IGFBP1 neutralizing antibodies prevented osteoclastogenesis and preserved C2C12 myotube size when exposed to plasma from mice bearing CRCs. Notably, WT mMC38 bearers displayed reductions in muscle mass and strength, as well as in trabecular bone volume fraction (BV\/TV) and trabecular number (Tb.N). Conversely, IGFBP1-KO tumor hosts exhibited preserved skeletal muscle and bone mass. Altogether, our data implicate IGFBP1, an exquisitely liver-derived factor, as a novel mediator of musculoskeletal deficits in CRC cachexia, and supports novel strategies to counteract host-derived factors in the treatment of cancer-associated multi-organ complications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-03 Growth factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Cachexia,Liver,Metastatic tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Joshua  R.

We find that: 1) Receptor activation leads to endogenous Ras signaling at endomembranes, which is enhanced by golgi-localized guanine exchange factors. 2) Recruitment of SAM68 and MARCKS to oncogenic condensates fuels local Ras signaling and cell growth. 3) Major Vault Protein drives RasG12C inhibitor resistance by enhancing signaling at the golgi and altering mitochondrial metabolism. Together, these results highlight the importance of non-plasma membrane Ras signaling (endomembranes and condensates), and our new sensors should accelerate the discovery of new therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras,Drug resistance,Molecular imaging,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jason Z.

We previously reported that ARF6 is aberrantly activated in metastatic melanoma and that activation of ARF6 stimulates WNT5A\/beta-catenin and PI3K\/AKT signaling to promote invasion and accelerate metastasis. Herein, we discovered an ARF6 activation signature in primary melanomas that is associated with inferior overall survival, supporting a novel role for ARF6 in early-stage progression. Conversely, melanocyte-specific deletion of <i>Arf6<\/i> in <i>Dct;TVA::Braf<sup>V600E<\/sup>;Cdkn2a<sup>Null<\/sup><\/i> murine melanoma significantly reduced tumorigenesis and progression, and improved survival. Importantly, bulk tumor transcriptome analysis showed reduced expression of ERK-induced genes in these BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> tumors. Likewise, immunofluorescent staining of tumor sections showed a significant reduction of cytoplasmic and nuclear p-ERK levels. Together these data demonstrate that loss of ARF6 reduces BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup>-MAPK signaling output <i>in vivo<\/i>. This is a provocative finding because it implies that endomembrane trafficking has a major role in promoting BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup>-driven tumorigenesis. More specifically, ARF6 may be critical for augmenting BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> signaling. Consistent with this hypothesis, expression of activated ARF6(ARF6<sup>Q67L<\/sup>) in our murine BRAF<sup>V600E <\/sup>melanoma cells was associated with upregulation of BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup>, p-MEK, and p-ERK levels, detected by Reverse Phase Protein Array analysis. In addition, ARF6<sup>Q67L<\/sup> tumor cells showed an increase in anti-apoptotic proteins with a reciprocal decrease in pro-apoptotic proteins. Knockdown of <i>Arf6<\/i> in BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup> human melanoma cells significantly reduced proliferation and sensitized cells to vemurafenib-induced apoptosis. Overall, our data reveal that ARF6 augments MAPK signaling in BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup>-driven tumorigenesis. Further work is needed to understand if ARF6 mediates endomembrane-dependent signaling of the BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup>-MAPK pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"GTPase,Melanoma\/skin cancers,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Junhua Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Aaron Rogers<sup>1<\/sup>, Coulson Rich<sup>1<\/sup>, Lise Sorensen<sup>2<\/sup>, Sheri Holmen<sup>3<\/sup>, Roger Wolff<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Allie Grossmann<\/b><sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Oncological Sciences, University of Utah Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Surgery, University of Utah Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Pathology, University of Utah Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bd1281a3-ebc8-4156-afb7-4ae0bf16d035","ControlNumber":"2153","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Moreover, KRAS4B (hereafter KRAS) but not HRAS is a potent driver of stemness traits in cancer cells. Exactly how KRAS promotes stemness and how this activity can be targeted with drugs is not understood. Here we studied the subcellular localization of KRAS mutants to stemness mediating centriolar organelles and the effect of these mutants on the differentiation of mouse muscle C2C12 cells. This cell line contains a pool of ciliated stem\/ progenitor cells, which differentiate under low serum conditions, concomitant with a drop in RAS-MAPK activity. Intriguingly, expression of oncogenic KRAS retains the stem-like state, even under differentiating conditions. We hypothesized that KRAS localization at the primary cilium of C2C12 progenitor cells is propagated via the mother centriole to the mother centrosome, which is known to asymmetrically partition into the stemness retaining cell. Using confocal microscopy, we show that the trafficking chaperone PDE6D (or PDEdelta) facilitates trafficking of KRAS not only to the plasma membrane, but also to the primary cilium. Cellular BRET-interaction experiments in HEK cells demonstrate that decreasing the affinity between KRAS and PDE6D by the phosphomimetic S181D-mutation in KRAS, correlates with a reduced KRAS localization in the cilium of C2C12 cells. Likewise, treatment with Sildenafil, which increases the phosphorylation of Ser181 of KRAS, disrupts its binding to PDE6D. We then established a flow-cytometry based C2C12 cell differentiation assay to quantify accurately that mutations and pharmacological manipulations, which decrease ciliary localization of KRAS, indeed promote differentiation. These data lend a new rationale to PDE6D inhibition. By combining computational modelling and in vitro testing, we therefore developed a new, low nanomolar inhibitor, Deltaflexin-3 (structure will be disclosed), which targets the hydrophobic pocket of PDE6D. This compound is highly soluble and displays improved on-target activity as compared to previous PDE6D inhibitors, which is demonstrated by a panel of cellular BRET- and proliferation-assay data. Our results suggest that blocking of the ciliary localization of KRAS by synergistically combining PDE6D inhibitors and Sildenafil could specifically inhibit its stemness driving activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB03-04 GTPases, their regulators, and effectors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras oncogene,Drug discovery,Cell cycle,Cancer stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Pelin Kaya<sup>1<\/sup>, Rohan Chippalkatti<sup>1<\/sup>, Elisabeth Schaffner-Reckinger<sup>1<\/sup>, Bianca Parisi<sup>1<\/sup>, Ganesh  B.
