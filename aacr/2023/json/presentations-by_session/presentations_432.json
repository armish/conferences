[{"Abstract":"Neutrophils extracellular traps (NETs), which are DNA scaffolds in complex with granule proteins, could be detected in the pre-metastatic liver niches and were associated with a poor survival in breast cancer patients. However, the mechanisms of neutrophils infiltration and NETs formation in the pre-metastatic liver tissues remain poorly understood. Here, we dynamically characterized the liver micro-environment of normal and 4T1-bearing BALB\/C mouse models with or without liver metastasis by the single cell RNA sequencing. Interestingly, we found that CXCL1 and CXCL2, derived from the liver macrophages, were dramatically elevated in pre-metastatic livers and induced the infiltration of peripheral neutrophils by CXCR2. Besides, liver macrophages were educated by cancer cells-derived cathepsin C to secrete the CXCL1 and CXCL2. Furthermore, we identified that the complement signals were over-activated in pre-metastatic livers and induced neutrophils to NETosis. Therapeutically, targeting CXCL1, CXCL2 and complement signals could inhibit the NET formation and effectively reduce breast cancer liver metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Inflammation and cancer: Metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor metastases,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Heliang Li<sup><\/sup>, Linbin Yang<sup><\/sup>, <b>Erwei Song<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"de8fd73e-219a-4b02-899f-4c48524f6b1d","ControlNumber":"277","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

Through single-cell sequencing analysis of para-cancerous tissue, tumor tissue, normal lymph node tissue and lymph node metastasis tissue in 4 untreated ESCC patients, we found that APOC1 was specifically up-regulated in lymph node metastasis tissue and tumor tissue. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that APOC1 overexpression significantly promoted the migration and anti-ferroptosis function in ESCC. Also, APOC1 upregulation promotes M2 macrophage differentiation, Treg aggregation, and CD8 T cell immune inactivation in lymph node metastasis tissue. Mechanistically, APOC1 competes with NRF2 to bind Keap1, promoting nuclear translocation of NRF2 thus upregulating activation of the NRF2 pathway in tumor cells. For the lymph node metastasis tumor microenvironment, secreted APOC1 could upregulate the oxLDL which induced M2 macrophage polarization via CD36\/JAK2\/STAT3 axis. Overall, in this study, we explored the role and molecular mechanism of APOC1 in ESCC metastasis process which could provide a new molecular therapeutic approach to ESCC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Oncogenic pathway-mediated regulation of inflammation and tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell death,Carcinoma: squamous cell,Macrophages,Cholesterol,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Beilei Liu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Baifeng Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Hongyu Zhou<sup><\/sup>, Licheng Tan<sup><\/sup>, Xiaona Fang<sup><\/sup>, Lanqi Gong<sup><\/sup>, Jie Luo<sup><\/sup>, Jinlin Huang<sup><\/sup>, Jiao Huang<sup><\/sup>, Yuma Yang<sup><\/sup>, Xinyuan Guan<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"24e9a0bc-ef0e-499b-b2f9-0e55bbf61a18","ControlNumber":"878","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>B.

One-third of patients with advanced ccRCC present with bone metastases at the time of diagnosis. Despite therapeutic advances, once cancer has metastasized to the bone, it represents a highly morbid and ultimately lethal disease. Comprehensive genomic studies in ccRCC have provided important insights into the somatic alterations and intra-tumor heterogeneity. However, the bone metastatic niche in humans, including the immune and stromal microenvironments, has not been well-defined.<br \/>Methods: We collected fresh patient samples directly from the operating room and performed single-cell transcriptomic profiling of human ccRCC tumors (cc<i>RCC primary<\/i>), solid metastatic tissue (<i>Bone Met<\/i>), liquid bone marrow at the vertebral level of spinal cord compression (<i>Involved<\/i>), liquid bone marrow from a different vertebral body distant from the tumor site but within the surgical field (<i>Distal<\/i>), as well as bone marrow stroma cells from patients undergoing hip replacement surgery (<i>Benign<\/i>) as control. We provide a comparative single cell transcriptomic analysis between ccRCC primary tumors and bone metastatic lesions.<br \/>Results: Comparison of malignant cells from primary and metastatic sites reveal a distinct transcriptional signature that is predictive of metastatic potential and patient survival. The bone marrow in metastatic patients has sustained immune-suppressive microenvironment, featuring increased, exhausted CD8+ cytotoxic T&#8209;cells, T&#8209;regulatory cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) with distinct transcriptional states in metastatic lesions. Bone marrow stroma from tumor samples demonstrated a tumor-associated mesenchymal stromal cell population (TA-MSC) that appears to be supportive of epithelial-to mesenchymal transition (EMT), bone remodeling, and a cancer-associated fibroblast (CAFs) phenotype. This stromal subset is associated with poor progression-free and overall survival, markedly upregulates bone remodeling through the dysregulation of RANK\/RANKL\/OPG signaling activity in bone cells, ultimately leading to bone resorption.<br \/>Conclusions: These results provide insights into mechanisms underlying of ccRCC tumors progression leading bone metastasis. We also highlight potential communication channels and therefore therapeutic targets within both the immune and the tumor cell populations.<b><\/b><b> <\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Inflammation and cancer: Metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Bone metastasis,Renal cell carcinoma,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shenglin Mei<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Adele  M.

Melanoma brain metastases (MBM) are a significant clinical challenge, and current model systems and therapeutic strategies are poor. Inhibitors targeting the most common oncogenic driver of melanoma, BRAFV600E (BRAFi), disrupt mitogenic signaling and promote caspase-3 associated cell death. Though caspase-3 is a well-known apoptotic driver, it can also cleave Gasdermin E (GSDME) to create pore-forming N-terminal fragments that oligomerize at plasma and mitochondrial membranes and trigger pyroptosis - a form of immunogenic cell death (ICD). Our recent work illustrates the importance of GSDME mediated pyroptosis and associated immunogenicity in providing a durable therapeutic response against melanoma. Since pyroptosis can be activated by GSDME cleavage via caspase-3, and is prominent in various neuropathologies, a better understanding of the interplay between central nervous system (CNS) immune cells and BRAFi-mediated ICD is critical for designing more effective therapies against MBM. Here, we engineered a panel of inducible pyroptotic melanoma cells to model BRAFi-mediated pyroptosis. Using ex vivo CNS slice co-cultures, we found that inducible N-GSDME expression in human and murine melanoma cells drives propidium iodide uptake and release of inflammatory activators like HMGB1 and IL-1 - hallmarks of pyroptosis. Importantly, conditioned media from these pyroptotic cells stimulates a more robust phagocytic response from resident macrophages of the CNS and pyroptotic melanoma elicit stronger cytotoxicity from syngeneic CD8+ T cells, further highlighting the benefits of BRAFi-mediated ICD. Our findings provide evidence that resident CNS immune cells and peripheral T cells respond to pyroptotic melanoma, suggesting that induction of ICD should be a consideration in the development of anti-MBM therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Inflammation and cancer: Metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune response,Metastasis,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Cancer cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maria  R.

Various risk factors are thought to drive this disparity, including socioeconomic status, tumor characteristics, comorbidities, and quality of treatment. Complex diseases and environmental insults all invoke and\/or disrupt host inflammation, with individual immune and variable responses to therapeutic agents being dictated in part by genetic variants. This latter has seldom been studied with regards to precision diagnosis and prognosis of individual patient responses, in the frame of geographical ancestry and TNBC. Interleukin-4 receptors (IL4R) have been shown to be upregulated in many epithelial cancers and could be a promising target for metastatic tumor therapy. Yet, IL4R overexpression and\/or IL4R variants have not been evaluated in TNBC cell lines of varying genetic ancestry. In view of this, we investigated the effects of IL-4 treatment in four TNBC cell lines varying in proportions of West African Ancestry (WAA) in each cell line: MDA-MB-231 (0.019), HCC-1143 (0.012), HCC-1806 (0.807), MDA-MB-468 (0.803). The frequency of IL4R variants also differed in each cell line. We used high content live cell imaging to evaluate the effect of IL-4 treatment on cellular migration by measuring wound healing. We show that IL-4 treatment on TNBC cells enhances migration as indicated by increased wound healing when compared to non-treated cells. High glucose, at a concentration of 10 g\/L, delays cell migration in IL4-treated TNBC cells. This data suggests that comorbidities, such as high glucose levels (i.e., uncontrolled diabetes) could impact tumor behavior and mortality disparities between populations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-03 Inflammation and cancer: Metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Migration,African American,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Portia Andrews<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kevin  S.

Vagus nerve is often resected in the process of lymph node dissection in surgery for upper gastrointestinal tract malignancies. Several studies have shown that vagus nerve controls immune cell functions in abdominal organs through so called &#8220;cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway&#8217;, which may seriously affect the tumor progression. However, the effect of vagotomy on postoperative outcome of the patients with gastric cancer is unclear.<br \/>Methods: We investigated the effects of vagotomy on the intraperitoneal immunity and the development of peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer in murine model. C57BL\/6 mice were divided into two groups and subjected to sub-diaphragmatic vagotomy with pyloroplasty (VxPP) or sham operation with vagus-nerve preservation (PP). Then, YTN16P, syngenic murine gastric cancer cell line, were injected in the peritoneal cavity of these mice and number of peritoneal metastases on the mesentery and omentum was counted after 2 weeks. Immune cells were collected from peritoneal lavage or spleen and the ratio or numbers of lymphocytes and granulocyte subsets, including large peritoneal macrophage (LPM), small peritoneal macrophage (SPM), neutrophil, eosinophil, were analyzed at several points using flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: The ratios of LPM, SPM and neutrophil almost unchanged at the 2weeks after surgery. However, the expression level of F4\/80 of LPM in VxPP group decreased as compared with that in PP group (Mean Fluorescent Intensity; PP: 4510 &#177; 3610 vs VxPP: 660 &#177; 300, n=3). The ratio of regulatory T cell (Treg) in the spleen decreased at 2 weeks, but recovered to the preoperative levels 3 weeks after operation. There was no significant difference in the number of metastatic nodules on the mesentery between two groups (PP: 52.9 &#177; 24.6 vs VxPP: 62.8 &#177; 18.1, p=0.25, n=13).

While mutated Kras, an important oncogenic driver in PDAC, has been found mutated in about 40% of CP patients, other mutations or mutagenic drivers potentially arising during the course of this chronic inflammatory disease are not well established. Recently, inflammation-triggered APOBEC single-strand DNA-specific cytidine deaminases were identified as important mutagenic drivers in PDAC. In addition, we unraveled a so far unrecognized role for A3A in driving chromosomal instability (CIN) independent of its deaminase function. Importantly, we found APOBEC3A (A3A), a member of the APOBEC family, to be associated with an IFNg immune response, activated during CP, and in a mouse model of AP, A3A significantly aggravated the course of the disease.

Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) exerts a key role in lipid homeostasis and play a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of obesity, diabetes, and NASH. Small molecules like EPB-53 that are activators of heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) of eukaryotic initiation factor 2&#945; (eIF2&#945;) kinase have been synthesized to induce FGF21. Previous study has shown that oral administration of EPB-53 alleviates NASH through increased FGF21 to prevent hepatic steatosis. However, it is unknown whether EPB-53 can prevent NASH-HCC transition.<br \/>Aim: To investigate the effect of EPB-53 on NASH-HCC transition and the therapeutic mechanism, focusing on the lipid metabolic reprogramming and tumor immune microenvironment (TIM).<br \/>Methods: NASH-HCC transition model was established in two-week-old male FGF21 knockout (KO) mice and wild type controls (C57BL\/6J mice) by diethylnitrosamine (DEN) administration at 40 mg\/kg body weight (i.p.). Four weeks after DEN administration, the mice were fed with western-style high fat diet (WSHFD, 60% kcal% fat and 19% kcal% fructose) for 3 months, and gavaged daily with either vehicle, 2% w\/v, (2&#8208;hydroxypropyl)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin or EPB&#8208;53 (300 mg\/kg\/day) in vehicle for 4 weeks before sacrifice. The tumor incidence, lipid metabolism, and carcinogenesis signaling pathways were determined. Mass cytometry (CyTOF) analysis was performed to detect the cell subpopulations in the NASH microenvironment and NASH-HCC TIM.<br \/>Results: Severe NASH with tumor cell detection, aberrant lipid components and HIPPO-YAP signaling were found in liver tissues of FGF21-KO mice compared to the WT controls. The upregulated sphingosine Kinase 1 (SPHK1)\/sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in liver subsequently induced YAP dephosphorylation and nuclear localization. EPB-53 treatment prevents NASH-HCC transition evident as decreased HCC incidence in WT mice but not in FGFKO mice. Continuously increased FGF21 production in WT mice contributes to down-regulation of SPHK1-S1P-HIPPO-YAP signaling. Interestingly, EPB&#8208;53 treatment can alleviate the compromised function of macrophages\/Kupffer cells which render a TIM in the NASH-HCC mice.<br \/>Conclusion: 1) Lack of FGF21 played a key role in lipid metabolic disorder and SPHK1-S1P-HIPPO signaling to promote NASH-HCC transition; 2) Lack of FGF21 rendered a TIM in NASH liver contributing to the NASH-HCC transition; 3) EPB&#8208;53 treatment can not only alleviate NASH, but also prevent NASH-HCC transition via lipid metabolic reprogramming, down-regulation of the SPHK1-S1P-HIPPO axis, and modulation of TIM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Tumor microenvironment,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Min Tan<sup>1<\/sup>, Eugenia Pujol<sup>2<\/sup>, Santiago Vazquez<sup>2<\/sup>, Jingwen Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Jun Yan<sup>1<\/sup>, Robert  C.

Wound-healing type macrophages accumulate in sites of tissue injury, such as the cirrhotic liver, where they can induce oxidative damage and secrete immunosuppressive and pro-fibrotic factors that lead to oncogenesis. These innate immune cells are also major cellular producers of PDGFB and TGF-&#946;1, which stimulate fibroblasts to secrete extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagen, and which also promote metastatic progression of neoplastic diseases. Chronic liver and pancreatic inflammation are significant risk factors for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), respectively. We have determined that the myeloid cell specific PI3K isoform PI3K&#947; promotes the accumulation of myeloid cells and their immune suppressive polarization within the tumor microenvironment (TME), and that this kinase thereby promotes tumor growth in animal models of cancer, including PDAC. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of PI3K&#947; suppresses tumor growth and reduces fibrosis that is associated with PDAC and other tumors. Targeting immune suppressive myeloid cells represent an emerging approach within the field of cancer immunotherapy and fibrosis treatment; indeed, inhibition of PI3K&#947; by the therapeutic eganelisib has shown beneficial effects, including increased overall and progression-free survival in clinical trials for melanoma, head and neck carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma and triple negative breast carcinoma. In this project, we are exploringWe examined the effect of whether PI3K&#947; inhibition can in cancer prevention using mouse models of prevent cancer development by suppressing damaging chronic hepatic and pancreatic inflammation, associated fibrosis, and progression towards tumorigenesis using models of HCC and PDAC. We found that PI3K&#947; inhibition prevented prevents acute and chronic inflammation and that promotes normal tissue loss and development of fibrosis in mouse models of chronic pancreatitis and liver inflammation. Studies are underway to determine iOur studies indicate thatf PI3K&#947; inhibition can also prevent the development of pancreatic and liver carcinoma that results fromin response to chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Our These studies thus far suggest the a potential role of for PI3K&#947; inhibition in the prevention of cancer development by preventing the chronic inflammation that leads towards fibrosis and carcinogenesis. The results of these studies could be applied to the future design of clinical trials with using clinical PI3K&#947; inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),Pancreatic cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anghesom Ghebremedhin<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Judith Varner<sup>1<\/sup>, Marc Paradise<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Pathology, UCSD Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>UCSD Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7c890c2d-0de0-43a3-95d7-160520b6c5cf","ControlNumber":"6780","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Prolonged systemic inflammation from inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn&#8217;s disease (CD) pose a greater risk to colorectal cancer (CRC) and accumulating data suggests that prostate cancer (PCa) risk is higher in patients with UC but not CD and that patients with PCa may be at a greater risk for CRC. A better understanding of the biological interactions between these conditions could have important implications for cancer screening, detection, and prevention in high-risk populations. However, data to establish the relationships and relative contributions of these diseases are lacking. Here, we explored these relationships using preclinical mouse models of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis (DSS-UC) and DSS\/azoxymethane (AOM)-induced CRC (DSS\/AOM-CRC) in young and aged healthy wildtype mice and transgenic mice harboring <i>Pten<\/i>-deficient PCa. In the DSS\/AOM-CRC model, aged PCa-bearing conditional <i>Pten<\/i>-knockout (KO) mice experienced poorer overall survival compared to age-matched wildtype (WT) without PCa because of CRC. DSS\/AOM-CRC incidence was not affected by the presence of PCa, however tumor burden was higher in KO mice compared to WT and in KO mice, DSS\/AOM-CRC accelerated PCa growth and progression. Prostates from WT DSS\/AOM-CRC mice showed higher incidence of hyperplasia and greater myeloid cell infiltration compared to healthy controls. Systemic changes associated with DSS\/AOM-CRC in both WT and KO mice included splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and immune cell composition. The impact of DSS-UC was investigated conditional <i>Pten\/Trp53<\/i>-double knockout (DKO) mice with DDS only treatments starting at an age prior to the development of PCa. In this setting, cycling DSS led to the development of UC after 10 weeks of treatment and accelerated prostate tumor development characterized by high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) grade dysplasia and increased cell proliferation. Prostate tumors from mice with DSS-UC exhibited an altered tumor immune microenvironment characterized by a higher degree of inflammatory cell infiltrate. Changes in immune cell composition were also observed in peripheral blood and secondary lymphoid organs. These preclinical models recapitulated disease relationships observed in humans and provide a platform to further investigate biological mechanisms and therapeutic interventions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-04 Inflammation and cancer: Tumor initiation and progression,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inflammatory bowel disease,Prostate cancer,Colorectal cancer,Cancer progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Marco A.

There was a wide range of viral signature richness, with cervical cancer showing the highest viral read count predominated by HPV serotypes; in contrast, stomach cancer had lower abundance but contained over 300 unique viral taxa. Exploratory clinical analysis revealed novel correlations between viral signatures and OS. In cervical cancer, presence of HPV45 predicted worse survival (median OS 837 days vs 4086, p=0.0043); MVA demonstrated hazard ratio (HR) of 5.7 [2.6-11.4, p&#60;0.0001]. In stomach cancer, patients often had more than one viral taxon present (mean 3.7, range 0-18); presence of 7 or more unique taxa predicted worse OS (median OS 403 days vs 1153, p=0.0001). MVA showed HR 1.1 for every additional taxon (p=0.0004).<br \/><b><u>Conclusions<\/u><\/b>: VirMAP performs deep characterization of the tumor-associated virome in both high and low abundance settings, with generation of partial genome reconstructions and strain level taxonomic classification.

However, allo-HCT poses a significant risk for post-transplant mortality due to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which is associated with loss of beneficial intestinal microbiota and decrease of microbial metabolites. In addition, dietary fiber can modulate the intestinal microbiome and the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are microbial metabolites associated with intestinal homeostasis. Therefore, we hypothesized that a high-fiber diet is associated with an increase of beneficial commensals, higher concentrations of SCFAs, and decreased risk of GVHD.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We collected dietary data and fecal samples from 73 allo-HCT patients (GVHD n=45, No-GVHD n=28) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, collected longitudinally throughout the allo-HCT course, and performed 16s rRNA, shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (n=311). We assessed the &#945;-diversity, microbiome composition, and concentrations of fecal SCFAs in response to fiber intake. We also tested different concentrations of dietary fiber (0%, 6%, 12% and 40%) in a preclinical GVHD model (C57BL\/6J into BALB\/c, n=30 per group, n=180 total) and assessed GVHD lethality and fecal microbial composition.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We found that in allo-HCT patients, fiber intake significantly correlated with microbial &#945;-diversity (R=0.3,<i> p<\/i>=0.01) and patients with a higher fiber diet had a significantly higher microbial &#945;-diversity when compared to the low fiber cohort (p&#60;0.001). Remarkably, the decrease in dietary fiber post-allo-HCT correlated with a significant reduction in the fecal concentrations of SCFAs in the GVHD group (n=14), butyrate (p=0.003), propionate (p=0.01), and acetate (p=0.004), that was not significant in the No-GVHD cohort (n=28), indicating that low dietary fiber could lead to lower production of bacterial metabolites in GVHD. In addition, mice receiving a fiber-rich diet (12%) had a significant reduction in GVHD lethality (p=0.02) compared to mice receiving lower or higher fiber (0%, 6%, 40%). A 12% fiber diet also resulted in higher microbial &#945;-diversity (p=0.02) and a significant decrease in <i>Enterococcus faecalis<\/i> (p=0.05), a pathogen associated with worse GVHD mortality in mice and humans.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: Our study demonstrates that a) higher fiber intake in patients after allo-HCT is associated with an increase in &#945;-diversity and SCFA concentrations, and b) optimal fiber consumption in pre-clinical GVHD models leads to an increase in &#945;-diversity, a decrease in pathogen mono-domination, and more importantly, a decrease in GVHD lethality.

In addition, Trp is appreciated for its influence on both host and microbial metabolism. Trp is shunted into the Kyn pathway (mostly) and indolic pathway (bacterial degradation), especially in the immune cells. Both Kyn and Indole\/indole derivatives, in part by activating the ligand-dependent transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), can become dysfunctional in cancer. Most individuals with cancer such as colon cancer, exhibit increased L-kynurenine levels, which in part is explained by progression of immunosuppressive phenotype and excessive inflammatory signaling molecules. To date, studies in mice and humans have linked Kyn and AHR as potent modulators of host immunity to colon cancer (CRC). Nothing is yet known about their role in pre-cancer, during the development of adenomatous polyps. We hypothesized that increases in plasma Kyn and I3A and their receptor AHR on immune cells would be detected in patients with pre-malignant polyps, suggesting dysbiosis and increased colon cancer risk due to immune modulation.<br \/>Methods: We measured with mass spectrometry Kyn and I3A in plasma samples of 88 polyp patients and compared to 22 colon cancer patients. We analyzed by flow cytometry PBMCs from 64 newly diagnosed advanced polyp patients (40-70 years old) and 9 age-matched colon cancer patients in order to evaluate AHR expression in different subsets of T cells, NKT cells and NK cells, and their possible association with exhaustion markers Tim-3, LAG-3 and PD-1, as well as Granzyme K, and the presence of immunosuppressive Treg and MDSC.<br \/>Results: We showed high level of expression of gut microbiota-derived metabolites in plasma of colon pre-cancer compared to cancer patients. We identified CD8+ T effector memory cells (TEM) as primary T cell population expressing their receptor AHR in polyp patients, which had a statistically significant association with Granzyme K expression, which is a hallmark of inflammaging.<br \/>Conclusions: Our results suggest gut microbiota-derived metabolites as potential mediators of immunosuppression in the setting of premalignancy, which could increase cancer risk and be targets of cancer-preventing strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Adenoma,T cell,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Amir Hossein Mohseni<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sedigheh Taghinezhad-S<sup><\/sup>, Pamela  L.

CEACAM proteins are immune and epithelial cell regulators, and some CEACAMs (CEACAM1, 3, 5, and 6) bind to pathogenic microbes. CEACAMs and mutations of the encoding genes are potential drivers of microbiome changes through altered regulation of host-immune response, through a mechanism that we hypothesize involves TGF-&#946; signaling. We found that genetic alterations in CEACAM-encoding genes correlate with scores of TGF-&#946; pathway activity in GI cancers in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Furthermore, nearly 40% of human GI cancers have genetic alterations in components and regulators of the TGF-&#946; pathway.

Whereas a predictive role for the gut microbiome associated with ir colitis has been identified, a role for the skin microbiome in ircAE has not been explored extensively. In this study we sought to investigate the characteristics of the skin microbiome associated with ircAE.<br \/>Methods: Patients developing ircAEs as well as control patients on active ICB without ircAE were prospectively enrolled in an observational cohort study (NCT04283539). Skin microbiome samples were collected using skin tape stripping (STS), followed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Clinical, pathological and immunological characterization was conducted for every patient as part of the trial.<br \/>Results: 217 samples were available for analysis after shotgun metagenomic sequencing, including 20 from patients on ICB without ircAE, 59 from patients with maculopapular (MPR), 52 from eczematiform (ECZ), 41 from lichenoid and 45 from pruritus on apparently unaffected skin.<i> <\/i>When assessing similarity of samples using cosine similarity, similarity was stronger within samples from the same patient from affected and unaffected locations or different timepoints, compared to samples of different patients with the same ircAE phenotype (p = 0.025).

CSI-Microbes pipeline was applied to extract the uniquely mapped reads to microbial genomes and characterized the abundance and composition of intra-tumoral microbiome across different tissues and histology types.

Notably, microbiome detected in the non-neoplastic adjacent tissues were nearly exclusively shared with their paired primary GCs, while primary GCs contained about twice more species than the adjacent tissues, indicating an increased diversity in microbiome species in tumor tissues. The microbiome in patients&#8217; blood samples showed a similar diversity but the abundance and composition differed significantly from that observed in their matched primary GCs. Ascites samples showed a much lower microbiome abundance as well as diversity, exhibiting a clearly distinct landscape. Further analysis identified tissue- and site-specific enrichment of microbiome. In addition, correlation analysis with tumor genetic background, histology subtypes, oncogenic features as well as tumor immune phenotypes revealed interesting associations with microbiome profiles, suggesting the potential impact of intra-tumoral microbiome on tumor and immune cell properties in GC.

This cancer type is mostly HPV-16 negative and exhibits aggressiveness and resistance to therapies. Our previous studies have shown an oral microbiota (<i>Fusobacterium nucleatum a gram negative anaerobic bacillus<\/i>) associated with tumour progression in oral squamous cell carcinoma (1) . The enhanced degree of stemness involved may confer the CSCs to be highly aggressive, self-sufficient, transient and niche modulatory, the tumour stemness defense (TSD) phenotype (2). The TSD characteristics are expressed as a part of &#8220;stem cell niche defence mechanism&#8221; (2). The TSD phenotype in ABCG2+ CSCs are characterized by the activation of the MYC-HIF-2alpha stemness pathway (3), as well as altruistic defense mechanism (4). Here we further studied the role of F.N. in reprograming of oral CSCs to TSD phenotype.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>SCC-25 cell line containing EpCAM+\/ABCG2+ CSCs were treated with saliva samples of oral cancer patients (n=15). The cells were grown in antibiotic-treated media for 72 hours and then grown in serum-free conditioned media obtained from na&#239;ve MSC culture (2). The treated cells were then subjected to immunomagnetic sorting to obtain EPCAM+\/ABCG2+ CSCs; TSD phenotype of the sorted CSCs were evaluated as described (2). Some cells were lysed and subjected to bacterial culture to detect F.nucleatum. Next, we evaluated the therapy resistance of the saliva-treated CSCs with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy and small molecular inhibitors of stemness pathways. We also obtained primary oral cancer EpCAM+\/ABCG2+ of platinum treated patients (n=12), and lysed these cells for bacterial culture to detect F.nucleatum phenotype.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We confirmed the previous findings that F.nucleatum can be recovered from the EpCAM+\/ABCG2+ of SCC-25 cells treated with patient derived saliva ( processed saliva samples from relapsed cases; n=6\/16 live bacteria recovered). These EpCAM+\/ABCG2+ CSCs exhibited TSD phenotype, including the activation of MYC-HIF-2alpha stemness pathway, as well as TLR2\/4\/NFkB pathway. Importantly, the intracellular F.nucleatum exhibited an increase in surface proteins Fap 2,FadA, the two proteins involved in oncogenesis. We confirmed the FN induced TSD phenotype by treating SCC-25 cells with laboratory derived FN (ATCC 25586). Importantly, the primary tumor derived EpCAM+\/ABCG2+ CSCs of 6\/18 subjects exhibited the presence of F.N.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Our findings indicate the potential role of oral microbiome especially the F. nulceatum in oral cancer stem cell reprograming to the highly aggressive TSD phenotype.<br \/>1.

More recently, use of non-combustible smoking vectors, such as electronic cigarette vapors (ECV), have rapidly increased, especially among youth. Despite this emerging public health concern, the long-term impact of ECV exposure is poorly understood. Our lab sought to assess the safety of ECV and determine their influence on immune dysfunction and lung cancer progression by comparing the effects of CCS and ECV in an airway epithelial specific K-ras mutant mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma (CC-LR). Three cohorts of 6-week-old CC-LR mice were exposed to either room air, CCS, or ECV 5 days per week for 8 weeks. For CCS exposure, mice were exposed to CCS from 3R4F research cigarettes at a rate of 3 puffs\/min for 2 hours each day using the SCIREQ integrated Cigarette Smoking Robot. For ECV exposure, mice were exposed to 72 mg\/ml of liquid nicotine in 50% propylene glycol\/vegetable glycerin solution at a rate of 3 puffs\/min for 2 hours using the SCIREQ Electronic Nicotine Delivery System. While CCS led to a significant increase in tumor burden (25%), ECV showed no significant changes compared to room air-exposed control. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid had significantly increased total lung immune cell infiltrates in both CCS (30%) and ECV (25%), particularly in macrophage and lymphocyte populations. Immunophenotyping of CCS and ECV exposed lungs displayed pronounced pro-tumor immunosuppressive phenotypes, characterized by significantly decreased CD4+ IFN&#947;+ and CD8+ GZMB+ cytotoxic T cells along with a significantly elevated CD4+ FOXP3+ regulatory T cells. Furthermore, the cytotoxic cytokine IFN&#947; was significantly reduced in lungs of CCS- (7-fold) and ECV-exposed (2-fold) mice compared to room air-exposed controls. We also found increased levels of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 in lungs of CCS- and ECV-exposed mice. Previous studies have shown IL-10 to play an important role in microbiome-associated immune modulation, hence we performed a preliminary gut and lung microbiome study to assess microbiome dissimilarity in these cohorts. Taxonomic profiling via 16S rRNA gene sequencing of matched stool and lung samples showed differences in the relative abundance of several lung <i>Proteobacteria spp.<\/i> while gut <i>Firmicutes<\/i>, particularly <i>Turicibacter <\/i>and <i>Ileibacterium<\/i>, were increased by CCS and ECV. In conclusion, while both CCS and ECV increased immune suppression, ECV did not significantly promote tumorigenesis during this timeframe of intervention. Future studies probing differences in microbiome-modulated CCS and ECV immune dysfunction can help pave way for identification of new targets that foster new interception and early treatment strategies for K-ras mutant lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Lung adenocarcinoma,Smoking,Microbiome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Walter V.

However, only patients with microsatellite instability (MSI-High) or mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) benefit from ICI. One of the many factors that can influence ICI-response is the gut microbiome, however its effect remains elusive. Here we aim to investigate the role of the gut microbiome in ICI-response using machine learning (ML).<br \/>Methods: Clinical and genomic data of ICI-treated CRC patients were retrieved from the KEYNOTE-177 trial. Microbiome abundances from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were downloaded from the cBioportal database. A label propagation semi-supervised ML approach was conducted to label patients&#8217; responses to ICI treatment in the TCGA cohort. Tumor mutational burden (TMB), MSI status, treatment, histological subtype, TNM staging and prior chemotherapy were fitted into the semi-supervised model to predict ICI-response in the combination cohort. The normalized abundance of 1406 microbial signatures were regularized using a LASSO model to avoid multicollinearity. Signatures with a non-zero LASSO coefficients were fitted into a supervised ML Random Forest Classification model (RFC) to evaluate their prediction for ICI-response. Samples were split with 80:20 training-testing ratio, and model&#8217;s performance was evaluated on the testing set using mean bootstrap estimate, 10-fold cross-validation (CV), and area under curve (AUC).<br \/>Results: A total of 538 CRC patients from the TCGA and 29 ICI-treat patients from the KEYNOTE-177 trial were fitted into the semi-supervised model to label ICI-response in the TCGA cohort. A total of 95 patients were labeled as responder (R) while 488 patients were labeled as non-responder (NR). Responders had significantly higher TMB levels than NR (mean TMB: 22.5 vs. 12.2, p-value &#60;0.0001). Of the 95 R, 42 were MSS, and 53 patients were MSI-High. While 417 of the NR were MSS. A total of 25 microbial signatures were screened after LASSO for their ICI prediction and were fitted into the RFC model along with TMB and MSI status (Hereafter called RFC27). The RFC27 model performed on the testing set with mean bootstrap estimate of 0.88 and 95%CI: [0.83-0.94], 10-fold CV of 0.84 and AUC of 0.97. TMB and MSI showed highest feature contribution followed by Actinopolyspora and Bacteroides Eggerthia. The relative abundance of both microbiotas was significantly different between R and NR (mean: 0.99 vs. 0.47, 2.0 vs. 1.6; p-value &#60;0.001 respectively).<br \/>Conclusions: Our results show that the gut microbiome can accurately predict ICI-response and their higher abundance contributed to a better response. Previous studies also reported a pro-inflammatory response of Bacteroides in addition to their association with ICI-response in melanoma patients, thus providing a potential therapeutic marker for ICI.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Colorectal cancer,Machine learning,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ayah N.

In Chile, LC is the second cause of cancer-related deaths. Recently, studies in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer<b> (<\/b>NSCLC) patients have highlighted the role of the gut microbiota as an important host factor in mediating the responses\/resistance to immunotherapy, suggesting that bacteria present in the gut may modulate the immune response in these tumors. However, the role of extra-intestinal microbiota; bacteria living outside of the gut, in cancer pathogenesis and the response to anti-cancer therapies remains largely undetermined. Here we characterize the composition of intratumoral microbiota of NSCLC and seek to establish a functional relationship between it and the composition of the immune microenvironment and the clinicopathological characteristics of NSCLC patients<b>.<\/b> From the first 157 FFPE NSCLC samples, we extracted DNA from all collected samples, obtaining adequate material in quality and quantity to later be submitted for analysis to 16S sequencing. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we assessed the general landscape of the NSCLC tumor microbiome, revealing the presence of large number of bacterial communities in the NSCLC tumor samples on the different histological subtypes analyzed. We have detected differences in alpha diversity in the histological subtypes studied. Even more interesting, we have detected significant differences in lung adenocarcinoma depending on the degree of histological differentiation, observing a decrease in proteobacteria and an enrichment of Bacteroidales, as cell differentiation is lost. Additionally, we identified taxonomic differences between differentiated and undifferentiated tumors. Differentiated tumors show enrichment in Akkermansia muciniphila and while undifferentiated tumors show enrichment in Actinobacter Corynebacterium.

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) with driver mutations in the KRAS oncogene is the most prevalent molecular subtype of lung cancer. KRAS<i> <\/i>mutant LUAD exhibits aggressive biology in part due to enhanced pro-tumor inflammation mediated by activation of the nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B) and, consequently, elevated expression of various cytokines. While the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1&#946; is a product of the NF-&#954;B pathway it also acts as a potent activator, further amplifying the production of protumor cytokines via a positive feedback loop. We have shown that IL-1&#946; blockade enhances anti-tumor immune responses while inhibiting immunosuppression in a mouse model of KRAS mutant LUAD driven by lung epithelial cell-specific expression of KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> (CCSP<sup>Cre<\/sup>\/LSL-KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>, CC-LR mouse). Cell lineage-specific mechanisms that underlie these anti-tumor effects following inhibition of IL-1&#946; are still poorly understood. To fill this void, we here explored the effects of targeting the IL-1R receptor in KRAS mutant lung epithelial cells in the CC-LR mouse model. We studied tumor development and host immune response in 14-week-old CC-LR mice with conditional knockout of IL-1R in KRAS mutant lung epithelial cells (LR\/IL-1R<sup>&#916;\/&#916;<\/sup>) in comparison to age- and sex-matched control CC-LR littermates. LR\/IL-1R<sup>&#916;\/&#916; <\/sup>mice displayed markedly reduced tumor multiplicity (~50%) when compared to control CC-LR mice concomitant with decreased cell proliferation and angiogenesis evidenced by attenuated immunohistochemical expression of Ki-67 and ERG. Flow cytometry analysis showed an elevated inflammatory response, most evidently seen through the significant increase in infiltrating monocytes. Interestingly, a shift in type-1 conventional dendritic cells, commonly involved in antigen-cross presentation in tumorigenesis, to type-2 conventional dendritic cells was seen in LR\/IL-1R<sup>&#916;\/&#916; <\/sup>mice, suggesting a different method of cross-presentation resulting from the conditional knockout of IL-1R that could potentially lead to a protective T-cell response. These results were further confirmed via gene expression analysis of respective markers. Our findings provide further support for the role of the IL-1 cytokine family in the development and progression of KRAS mutant LUAD as well as warrant further studies targeted towards understanding the mechanistic effects IL-1&#946; has on the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Oncogenic pathway-mediated regulation of inflammation and tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Interleukin-1,Lung adenocarcinoma,NF-&#954;B,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Avantika Krishna<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Michael  J.

MDSCs contribute to tumor immune tolerance primarily via inhibition of cytotoxic T-cells or by activation of immunosuppressive T-regulatory cells. We previously showed that high tumor cell glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression is associated with a relatively poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients. Additionally, using primary tumor data retrieved from the ovarian cancer TCGA dataset, we show high tumor GR expression is associated with significantly higher expression of Foxp3, a marker of immunosuppressive T-regulatory cells, as well as CD33, a marker of immunosuppressive myeloid cells, further suggesting an immunosuppressive phenotype in ovarian cancer patients. We thus hypothesize that tumor-intrinsic GR activation in ovarian cancer is associated with increased MDSC infiltration into the tumor microenvironment in part via modulating tumor cell cytokine secretion. To determine whether tumor-cell GR activation modulates the cytokine secretome, we previously showed that GR activation in ovarian cancer cells upregulated secretion of immunomodulatory factors including G-CSF, TGFb and CXCL5. Moreover, co-treatment of cells with a selective GR modulator (SGRM), reverses this secretome effect. Considering that elevated levels of these cytokines are necessary for the production and recruitment of MDSCs, these data highlight the relevance of this evident glucocorticoid receptor-cytokine circuit in ovarian cancer tumor cells. Furthermore, we show that this tumor-cell cytokine secretome has the capacity to promote differentiation of MDSCs from precursor myeloid cells in healthy PBMCs. Importantly, measuring expression of activation markers such as Arginase-1 and NOS2 illustrated that these MDSCs are in their functional state. To our knowledge this is the first evidence that a nuclear receptor in ovarian cancer tumor cells is actively driving MDSC differentiation. Finally, employing ovarian cancer xenograft models as well as a syngeneic ID8 tumor model, treatment with SGRMs demonstrated reduced levels of circulating MDSCs in the peripheral blood as well as tumor infiltrated MDSCs. Using neutralizing antibodies for cytokines, we will now identify key mechanisms, specifically, identify which targetable immunomodulatory factors are contributing to immune suppression. Based on the insight provided by these data, we propose to determine whether targeting ovarian tumor cell-intrinsic GR activation and resulting MDSC infiltration contributes to improved anti-tumor immune response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunocytokines,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Manisha Taya<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Eleanore LeBlanc<sup><\/sup>, Lynda Bennett<sup><\/sup>, Suzanne  D.

Necroptosis has attracted particular interest as an approach for immunotherapy as activation of the RIPK1\/RIPK3 necrosome phosphorylates MLKL to form membrane pores, leading to loss of integrity and enhanced ability to induce an antigen-specific immune response in models of vaccination. Here we sought to determine if necroptosis within tumor cells was an important regulatory of anti-tumor immunity. Deficiency in <i>Ripk3<\/i> or <i>Mlkl <\/i>did not impact tumor incidence or growth in genetic models of mammary carcinoma or lung adenocarcinoma. Similarly, the growth of syngeneic cell lines was not altered by loss of <i>Ripk3<\/i> or <i>Mlkl<\/i> <i>in vitro<\/i> or <i>in vivo<\/i>. We next examined the induction of apoptosis or necroptosis in syngeneic tumor models using genetic constructs with doxycycline-controlled expression. In line with published data, subcutaneous vaccination demonstrated that RIPK3-induced necroptosis promoted an antigen-specific CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cell response greater than that observed with caspase 8-induced apoptosis. Surprisingly however, when necroptosis was induced within established PyMT-B6 orthotopic mammary tumors, we observed significantly reduced survival, which correlated with higher neutrophil and macrophage recruitment, along with lower CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell infiltration and IFN-&#947; expression. <i>In vitro<\/i>, necroptosis induced with either RIPK3 or MLKL greatly enhanced expression of <i>Cxcl1<\/i> and <i>Cxcl2<\/i>, a property that could be recapitulated by transferring dead cell supernatant to live cells, suggesting the presence of an alarmin or damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP). We therefore knocked out MyD88, which serves as a critical adapter protein to a number of surface receptors, including the TLR family, the IL1 receptor, and RAGE. The loss of MyD88 completely eliminated the ability of tumor cells to express <i>Cxcl1<\/i> in response to supernatant from necrotic cells. Expression was not driven by release of HMGB1 or signaling through RAGE or TLRs. Instead, we found that blocking the interleukin (IL)1 receptor or IL1&#945;, but not IL1&#946;, prevented<i> Cxcl1<\/i> expression. IL1&#945; is a constitutively expressed by some tumors, suggesting a potential role for IL1&#945; in regulating immune responses to therapies that induce necrotic-like forms of cell death. In support of this, <i>Il1a<\/i> expression was strongly predictive of progression free survival in triple-negative breast cancer. These findings suggest that IL1&#945; has an unexplored role in regulating the tumor microenvironment. By understanding how IL1&#945; regulates the immune response during cytotoxic therapy, our findings may explain why certain therapies are immunogenic (or not) in different cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunogenic cell death,Immunosuppression,Breast cancer,Necroptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kay Hänggi<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Aysenur Keske<sup><\/sup>, Alycia Gardner<sup><\/sup>, Jie Li<sup><\/sup>, Olabisi Osunmakinde<sup><\/sup>, Daiana Celias<sup><\/sup>, Amer Beg<sup><\/sup>, Brian Ruffell<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>H.

Tumor metabolic dysregulation is a key mediator of tumor immune evasion. High levels of lactate produced by the tumor potently suppress antitumor immunity in the TME. Pyruvate carboxylase (PC), the enzyme responsible for the anaplerotic conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate, is required for lung metastasis in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Moreover, PC may be dispensable in some cells within the TME, and loss of PC expression is associated with immunosuppression. Here we test whether PC suppression in two murine models of TNBC alters tumor metabolism and promotes immunosuppression. C57BL6\/J mice were orthotopically injected with E0771 or M-Wnt tumor cells bearing shRNA either targeting PC or a scramble control (n=3-6\/group for each experiment). Tumor growth was monitored by digital calipers. RNA isolated from tumors was used for transcriptomic profiling using Affymetrix Clariom D microarray. Gene set enrichment analysis was used to identify pathways and processes enriched in each condition, as well as to define a hypoxia signature associated with PC expression. Immunohistochemistry was performed using an anti-CD3 antibody to identify T cell infiltration. Untargeted metabolomics, extracellular flux analysis and high resolution respirometry were used to assay metabolic effects of PC suppression. We found that suppression of PC in multiple animal models promotes primary tumor growth (~2 fold increase in size) and alters metabolic, transcriptomic and immunohistochemical markers of tumor immunosurveillance. Specifically, suppression of PC drove reduction of OCR, which was restored when exogenous malate was provided to ensure anaplerosis was non-limiting. Simultaneously, lactate production was elevated by PC suppression, as was in vitro sensitivity to inhibition of lactate metabolism. Critically, we identified that loss of immunosurrveilance following PC suppression could be restored by inhibition of lactate transport. Finally, we demonstrated that PC expression is markedly lower in tumors of patients whose transcriptomic profile indicated higher levels of hypoxia, and confirmed in vitro that hypoxia can directly suppress PC. Taken together, these data demonstrate hypoxia-driven PC suppression may be a key mechanism through which primary tumors limit antitumor immunity in part via enhanced lactate production. Thus, these data highlight that PC-directed tumor metabolism is a nexus of tumor progression and antitumor immunity. Ongoing work will examine the immune profile of the TME from PC suppressed tumors, and identify if PC overexpression is sufficient to enhance antitumor immunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Immunosuppression,Hypoxia,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Michael F.

In addition, 23.6% of de novo AML patients overexpress FGFR1, compared with healthy individuals. Therefore, investigating how tumor-intrinsic FGFR1 signaling modulates the tumor microenvironment and their contribution to leukemogenesis is not only important for understanding leukemia initiation and progression but also critical for the development of an efficient cure for AML patients. Interleukin Receptor Associated Kinase 1 (IRAK1) is a protein kinase that initiates a cascade of signaling events eventually leading to activation of proinflammatory genes, including IL-6, IL-10, TNF-&#945;, and IFN-&#947;, which play critical roles in inflammation and innate immunity. The role of IRAK1 has been reported in several different subtypes of leukemia, including B cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC DLBCL), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and melanoma. Most previous IRAK1 studies, however, only focused on its survival and proliferation promoting roles inside the tumor cell itself. Since most of these studies engrafted human cancer cell lines into NSG mice, which lack a functional immune system, it was impossible to investigate the function of IRAK1 in modulating the tumor microenvironment. Using our well-established syngeneic SCLL mouse model, we defined IRAK1 gene as a critical target of FGFR1 in driving leukemogenesis. Our preliminary studies revealed that IRAK1 knockout (KO) in SCLL leukemia cells leads to T cell mediated clearance of the leukemia cells. In contrast, IRAK1 expressing mock control (MC) cells induce the accumulation of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which sequentially suppress T cell function to promote leukemia progression. These observations indicate a critical function for IRAK1 in modulating the tumor microenvironment and promoting leukemogenesis. Most importantly, pilot cytokine profiling of the MC and IRAK1 KO leukemia cells identified IFN-&#947; as one of the direct targets of IRAK1 in leukemia cells, and scRNA-Seq analysis revealed predominant expression of IFNGR1 and identified activation of the IFN-&#947; signaling pathway in leukemia induced MDSCs. Genes in this pathway include IFN-&#947; directly regulated genes, such as CD274 and SOCS3. Further engraftment using either IFNGR1-\/- mice or IFNG KO leukemia cells revealed the involvement of this leukemia cell intrinsic, IRAK1 regulated IFN-&#947; in modulating the tumor microenvironment to promote leukemogenesis. In summary, our data suggests that leukemia cell-derived, IRAK1 regulated inflammatory signals act as critical modulators in establishing a tumor favorable microenvironment during leukemogenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,Leukemias,Inflammation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ting Zhang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Xiaocui Lu<sup><\/sup>, Atsuko Matsunaga<sup><\/sup>, Xuexiu Fang<sup><\/sup>, Stephanie Fay Mori<sup><\/sup>, John Cowell<sup><\/sup>, Tianxiang Hu<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Augusta University, Augusta, GA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d8c0cd82-dac9-42ed-8b77-aa5ed0795f16","ControlNumber":"4925","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.
