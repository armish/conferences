[{"Abstract":"Introduction: Cancer diagnosis using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has the potential to improve treatment and survival but has several technical limitations.<br \/>Methods: Here, we used neomers, short DNA sequences (13-17bp in length) that are largely absent from the healthy human genome, but appear in the tumor genome due to somatic mutations, to detect cancer at early stages from cfDNA. cfDNA was extracted from 1mL of plasma, and utilized from Whole Genome Sequencing at 5X coverage.<br \/>Results: First, we analyzed over 2,500 cancer whole-genome sequences (WGS), to show that a neomer-based classifier can distinguish twenty-one different tumor types with higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods. Refinement of this classifier via manually selected neomer sets, identified additional cancer features with greater precision. We next generated cfDNA WGS data from &#62;600 patients and non-cancerous controls across four different types of cancers (prostate, lung, ovarian, colorectal), and demonstrated that neomers can precisely identify cancer from a limited amount of plasma for all four cancer types, with exampled sensitivities of 93.73% and 73.47% for lung and ovarian cancers, respectively. Additionally, using both luciferase and massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), we show that our neomer-driven approach can detect cancer-associated non-coding mutations that affect gene regulatory activity.<br \/>Conclusions: Our results show that neomers provide a novel, sensitive, specific and potentially broadly applicable cancer detection tool. This approach has several advantages over existing strategies for liquid biopsies: 1) it is based on standard next-generation sequencing which is already widely available in the clinic; 2) it requires low amounts of starting material and is completely tumor agnostic; 3) it searches the entire genome and is not restricted to known driver mutations. 4) it allows the detection of early-stage disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Early detection,Cell-free DNA,Screening,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ofer Yizhar Barnea<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ilias Georgakopoulos-Soares<sup>1<\/sup>, Nadav Ahituv<sup>1<\/sup>, Jocelyn Chapman<sup>1<\/sup>, Martin Hemberg<sup>2<\/sup>, Ioannis Mouratidis<sup>3<\/sup>, Konstantinos Syrigos<sup>4<\/sup>, Nikolaos Syrigos<sup>4<\/sup>, Ioannis Vathiotis<sup>4<\/sup>, Mayank Mahajan<sup>2<\/sup>, Emmanouil Panagiotou<sup>4<\/sup>, Andriani Charpidou<sup>4<\/sup>, Mark Kvale<sup>1<\/sup>, Candace  S.

Biopsy based diagnosis allows allocation to World Health Organization (WHO) sub-classification groups but prognosis often needs identification of specific genetic aberrations or gene expression patterns. Despite this strategy, prognosis is difficult, since diseases, like e.g. mantel cell lymphoma, can be indolent or aggressive. Here we report the characterization of NHL biopsies using epigenetic immune cell quantification. This approach is based on the identification of specifically demethylated regions in individual immune cell types. These regions are then quantified using methylation-sensitive qPCR after bisulfite conversion. This highly reproducible and objective method allows in depth immunophenotyping of the tumor microenvironment. Next to CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, B cells and NK cells more specialized immune cells like regulatory T cells (Tregs), follicular T helper cells, PD-1 expressing cells and Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) were quantitatively determined in formalin-fixed tissue samples of 251 patients with different B cell Non-Hodgkin lymphomas. As a result, characteristic immune cell distribution patterns were identified for the different lymphoma entities, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) (n=41), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) (n=32), follicular lymphoma (FL) (n=33), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (n=74), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) (n=40) and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) (n=26). In addition, substantial heterogeneity within the entities was observed that may correlate with disease prognosis. Among others, this is particularly the case for MDSC in B-CLL patients as well as for NK cells and Tregs in MCL and PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> cells in FL patients. Currently clusters within the different disease groups are analyzed with regard to the clinical outcome to investigate if disease prognosis can be predicted by epigenetic immune cell quantification. In conclusion, epigenetic immune cell quantification is a suitable method to analyze the tumor microenvironment of NHL patients with the potential to support patient&#8217;s prognosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diagnostic marker,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Prognostic markers,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jeannette Werner<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Steffi Walter<sup>1<\/sup>, Christoph Sachsenmaier<sup>1<\/sup>, Janika Schulze<sup>1<\/sup>, Deborah Phippard<sup>2<\/sup>, Sven Olek<sup>2<\/sup>, Barbara Seliger<sup>3<\/sup>, Claudia Wickenhauser<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Epimune GmbH, Berlin, Germany,<sup>2<\/sup>Precision for Medicine, Berlin, Germany,<sup>3<\/sup>Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle\/Saale, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1f541e02-7ba0-4075-9586-5979f2b4a4e2","ControlNumber":"2797","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

Thus, they are promising biomarkers for early diagnosis of cancer. However, conventional profiling methods like quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) require complex procedures, thereby limiting the analytical sensitivity of exosomes for liquid biopsies. Here, we demonstrate a sensitive microfluidic device (CDEXO) that isolates and profiles cancer-associated exosomes directly from blood plasma using assembled chiral gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The unique changes in chiral signals are associated with specific biomolecules on the exosomes&#8217; membranes. Thus, we can distinguish exosomes of lung cancer patients from those of healthy individuals and detect mutated EGFR proteins on the membrane. Hence, this low-cost microfluidic device is an attractive technique for rapid, sensitive, and versatile profiling of various extracellular vesicles.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: The top layer of CDEXO devices were fabricated by soft lithography using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The bottom glass slide was functionalized with a layer-by-layer assembly of cationic poly(dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride) and anionic polystyrene sulfonate. AuNPs were prepared by adding gold nanoplates to a growth solution. Next, AuNPs were conjugated with biotinylated Annexin-V, using Neutravidin-biotin chemistry. Exosomes were harvested from lung cancer cell lines (A549, H1650, H3255) and lung fibroblasts (MRC5) and spiked into the CDEXO chip. EDTA was used to release the captured exosomes and quantified using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). CD spectra were measured by spectrometry. Imaging of AuNPs and exosomes were done using scanning electron microscope (SEM).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>CDEXO captures cancer-associated exosomes with an efficiency of 81.1&#177;1.5%. H3255 derived exosomes that exhibited EGFR point mutation showed the greatest change in spectral signals from the baseline, followed by A549 (wild type), H1650, (EGFR exon19 deletion) and MRC5 (healthy). The CD responses were measurable at exosome numbers as low as 100. Further validation with 19 lung cancer patients showed an average 40% change in chiral signals from isolated exosomes that were 5.6 times higher in patients than healthy donors.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>A microfluidic device with chiral AuNPs allows sensitive and accurate detection of lung cancer-associated exosomes by conjugation with Annexin V. The resulting strong CD peaks that arise from specific interactions between exosomal surface proteins and chiral AuNPs facilitate in-depth profiling of target exosomes, including EGFR mutation expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular vesicles,Microfluidics,Lung cancer,Diagnostic marker,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yoon-Tae Kang<sup><\/sup>, Ji-Young Kim<sup><\/sup>, Emine Sumeyra Turali-Emre<sup><\/sup>, Hee-Jeong Jang<sup><\/sup>, Minjeong Cha<sup><\/sup>, <b>Abha Kumari<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Colin Palacios-Rolston<sup><\/sup>, Chitra Subramanian<sup><\/sup>, Emma Purcell<sup><\/sup>, Sarah Owen<sup><\/sup>, Chung-Man Lim<sup><\/sup>, Rishindra Reddy<sup><\/sup>, Shruthi Jolly<sup><\/sup>, Nithya Ramnath<sup><\/sup>, Nicholas A.

Our findings suggest that discriminatory biomarker levels between CRC cases and controls observed show their great potential as targets in novel blood-based screening tests for CRC. The development of a non-invasive CRC screening test will provide an alternative to increasing adherence, early detection, survivorship, and a tool for a population-based prevention strategy approach.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Diagnostic marker,Cancer detection,Colon cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Elba V.

They frequently harbor genetic alterations in <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>RB1<\/i>, <i>PTEN<\/i>, and <i>ATRX<\/i>. Their benign counterpart, uterine leiomyomas (or fibroids) are very common tumors that may significantly affect women&#8217;s quality of life. The majority of leiomyomas harbor genetic alterations affecting either <i>MED12<\/i>, <i>HMGA2<\/i>, or <i>FH<\/i>. A third of leiomyosarcomas have been reported to harbor leiomyoma-associated driver mutations, suggesting that some leiomyomas may have undergone malignant transformation. The leiomyoma\/leiomyosarcoma diagnosis is largely based on histopathology. This can be specifically challenging in differentiating leiomyosarcomas from a subset of leiomyomas that display histopathological features resembling malignancy. The aim of this study was to identify molecular biomarkers that can accurately differentiate benign and malignant uterine smooth muscle tumors. 3&#8217;RNA sequencing of 48 leiomyosarcomas and 44 leiomyomas revealed that leiomyosarcomas are uniquely characterized by dysregulation of the retinoblastoma pathway. We confirmed upregulation of several members of this pathway, including <i>TOP2A<\/i> and <i>CDK1<\/i>, in a publicly available transcriptomic dataset of 49 uterine leiomyosarcomas. The second objective of this study was to explore the gene expression profile of leiomyosarcomas carrying leiomyoma-associated driver mutations. This revealed that unlike leiomyomas, leiomyosarcomas do not form distinct gene expression profiles based on the presence of leiomyoma-associated driver mutations such as <i>MED12<\/i>. However, leiomyosarcomas with a <i>MED12<\/i> mutation showed upregulation of <i>RAD51B<\/i> and <i>ADAM12<\/i>, which we have previously highlighted as biomarkers of leiomyomas harboring a <i>MED12<\/i> mutation. We identified upregulation of <i>IRS4<\/i> and characteristic deletions affecting <i>COL4A5<\/i> and <i>COL4A6<\/i> in four in-house and three additional uterine leiomyosarcomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) collection. Similar driver alterations have previously been reported in a small subset of leiomyomas but not in leiomyosarcomas. In conclusion, leiomyosarcomas display a gene expression profile characterized by dysregulation of genes related to the retinoblastoma pathway. These include potential biomarkers that could be used in a clinical setting to differentiate leiomyosarcomas from leiomyomas.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RNA sequencing,Uterine Leiomyosarcomas,Uterine Leiomyoma,Molecular biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sara Khamaiseh<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Riitta Koivisto-Korander<sup>2<\/sup>, Terhi Ahvenainen<sup>1<\/sup>, Ralf Bützow<sup>3<\/sup>, Miika Mehine<sup>1<\/sup>, Pia Vahteristo<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Applied Tumor Genomics Research Program, Department of Medical and Clinical Genetics, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland,<sup>3<\/sup>Applied Tumor Genomics Research Program, Department of Pathology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6759b60c-55d2-4d44-933b-8bce062e1270","ControlNumber":"1988","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Early surgical resection improves prognosis, however, early detection by imaging and tissue biopsies is challenging due to tissue heterogeneity. In this multi-institutional study we analyze fragmentomic profiles of plasma cell free DNA (cfDNA) to non-invasively distinguish between NF1 associated PN, AN and MPNST. Accurate classification would inform clinical care: standards of care for PN is observation, AN is narrow-margin resection, and MPNST is wide-margin resection.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We performed whole genome sequencing of plasma cfDNA samples from healthy controls (<i>n<\/i> = 21), patients with PN (<i>n<\/i> = 113), AN (<i>n<\/i> = 39) and MPNST (<i>n <\/i>= 71). cfDNA fragment profiles were analyzed using two complementary approaches. First, we used unsupervised non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to obtain global fragment length signatures to infer tumor fragment length distributions. The optimal cutpoint was determined after receiver operating characteristic analysis by Youden&#8217;s index in one-versus-one (OVO) disease state comparisons. Additionally, we implemented a bin-wise fragmentomic analysis based on DELFI, training a classifier on the ratios of short (100-150bp) and long (151-220bp) fragments in 5 megabase regions across the genome and arm-level features.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>NMF accurately distinguished disease states on OVO comparisons: MPNST v AN (acc 0.71), MPNST v PN (acc 0.75), MPNST v healthy (acc 0.84), AN v PN (acc 0.70), AN v healthy (acc 0.80) and PN v healthy (acc 0.87). Accuracies were moderately improved in nearly all conditions with bin-wise fragmentomics: MPNST v AN (acc 0.62), MPNST v PN (acc 0.83), MPNST vs healthy (acc 0.86), AN v PN (acc 0.87), AN vs healthy (acc 0.72) and PN vs healthy (acc 0.88). Strikingly, the two AN with the DELFI scores most closely resembling MPNST were separately identified by independent clinical care teams to have very high-risk features and recent history warranting short-interval follow up.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>This study demonstrates that the spectrum of benign, pre-malignant and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors have distinct, disease state specific fragmentomic signatures. Fragmentomics alone outperformed our previously published copy number based cfDNA classifier in all conditions, most notably in low mutational burden healthy, PN and AN states. Finally, preliminary clinical vignettes suggest that this approach may be able to inform surveillance intervals by identifying higher risk premalignant lesions. Together, this work has the potential to enable earlier detection of clinically actionable AN and early-stage MPNST, thereby improving survival outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer markers,Cell-free DNA,Pediatric cancers,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alex  C.

Furthermore, CRC patients who are diagnosed at the most advanced (metastatic) stage is estimated to have the 5-year survival rate of 14%. Dramatically, studies shows that if it can be detected at an early stage when surgical removal is feasible, the 5-year survival rate significantly increases to 90%. Therefore, early detection for CRC with curative treatment intent is crucially important to significantly reduce the mortality and morbidity and even cure CRC. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid-bilayer-enclosed vesicles of sub-micrometer size that are secreted by virtually all cell types. They contain hundreds of different proteins, thousands of intact RNA species, and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) fragments that sample the entire human genome. Recent findings further corroborate the potential role of EVs in early cancer screening, cancer diagnosis, treatment selection and monitoring. In this study, we used lipid nanoprobe (LNP) for EV isolation and methylation-specific qPCR assay for detecting SEPT9 methylation to develop a minimal invasive CRC screening test. Firstly, we have successfully detected promoter methylation of cancer specific genes SEPT9 in EVs derived from both genomic DNA and EV DNA of the CRC cell line. Secondly, we isolated EV using LNP from plasma samples in a cohort of 19 CRC patients and 9 healthy donor controls. In parallel, we isolated circulating free DNA (cfDNA) from the same cohort of the plasma samples using commercially cfDNA isolation Kit. Then, SEPT9 methylation signature was analyzed by our quantitative real-time PCR assay in these 28 EV DNA samples and 28 cfDNA samples, respectively. In the 19 CRC samples, we identified 10 SEPT9 gene methylation samples from LNP-isolated EV DNA and cfDNA, respectively. In 9 healthy control samples, no SEPT9 methylation was detection in the EV-DNA samples, while one false-positive was detected with cfDNA. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of EV-DNA in the detection of SEPT9 gene methylation from CRC were determined to be 53% and 100% respectively. In comparison, the sensitivity and specificity of cfDNA are 53% and 89%, respectively from this preliminary pilot study. This indicated that EV-DNA might be superior to cfDNA in detecting SEPT9 gene methylation for CRC screening.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Extracellular vesicles,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Sheng Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Faming Wang<sup><\/sup>, Mingxi Chen<sup><\/sup>, Jeongyun Kim<sup><\/sup>, <b>Mengrou Lu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Hongzhang He<sup><\/sup>, Siyang Zheng<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Biomedical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d364721c-1e3a-4d4c-9a31-bafda7b0c7dc","ControlNumber":"6828","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

However, not all bladder cancers respond to PD-L1 immunotherapy which is why new targets are being assessed. Melanoma-associated antigen gene A (MAGE-A) family proteins are expressed in a variety of tumors, with each MAGE-A protein having unique roles in cancer pathogenesis. One advantage of targeting MAGE-A family members is the lack of expression in normal tissues which makes them well-suited for targeted cancer immunotherapy. The challenge with screening the MAGE-A family is to find a specific antibody since the 12-member family has over 60% sequence in homology. In this study, we evaluate multiple MAGE-A3 and MAGE-A4 antibodies using CytoSections, a reproducible alternative to control tissue with an expression of target biomarkers. A series of antibodies specific to each MAGE-A3 and MAGE-A4 protein were discovered and used to screen twenty-five bladder cancer tissues. The results showed that MAGE-A3 was present in 9 of the 25 bladder cancers, while MAGE-A4 was present in 10 of the 25 bladder cancers evaluated; in the meantime, 7 bladder cancers were positive for both targets after double immunofluorescence staining with MAGE-A3 or A4 specific antibodies. The data presented here could be an important development in treatment protocols for pre-screening patients who are at risk. Our findings show that MAGE-A3 and MAGE-A4 can be both present in bladder cancer, suggesting that targeting both genes may be necessary for the success of immunotherapy treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Immunohistochemistry,Cancer immunotherapy,Antigen presentation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Bailey Gilmore<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Rachel Gonzalez<sup>1<\/sup>, Aubrey Su<sup>1<\/sup>, Dehe Kong<sup>1<\/sup>, Eden Zewdu<sup>1<\/sup>, Jina Yom<sup>1<\/sup>, Tianli Qu<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhaoying Guo<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaomin Hu<sup>2<\/sup>, Qi Ren<sup>2<\/sup>, Ranran Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Eric Christenson<sup>1<\/sup>, Yan Ma<sup>1<\/sup>, Dezhong Yin<sup>1<\/sup>, Patrick Yin<sup>1<\/sup>, Wei Fu<sup>1<\/sup>, Xuan Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Krishnan Allampallam<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>OriGene Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD,<sup>2<\/sup>OriGene WuXi Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Wuxi, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"93a46d53-4452-466c-b23b-d552d4d7ba48","ControlNumber":"2979","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>B.

Studies have not assessed whether risk factors such as recent parity and body mass index (BMI) are linked to protein expression profiles in YBCs. Accordingly, we examined protein expression assessed with GeoMx&#174; Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) in 640 YBCs prepared as tissue microarrays (TMAs) in the Young Women&#8217;s BC Study (YWBCS).<br \/>Methods: The YWBCS is a multi-institutional cohort of 1,297 women with incident BC diagnosed at age <u>&#60;<\/u>40 years identified through medical record review, with risk factor data collected via questionnaires. TMAs including 1,505 cores of 640 YBCs that were collected prior to therapy and were suitable for molecular analysis were evaluated for 72 markers with NanoString GeoMx DSP. Associations of log-transformed biomarker expression with BMI and time from last live birth to BC diagnosis were carried out using linear mixed modeling approaches, accounting for multiple tumor tissue cores per individual.<br \/>Results: Mean age at BC was 35.5 years (range 17-40). Tumor subtypes based on clinical immunostaining were the following: luminal B 46%; luminal A 36%; triple negative 12% and HER2+ 6%. Of 72 biomarkers tested, 53 (74%) were evaluable after QC and normalization. GeoMx ER and PR protein levels were higher in luminal A and luminal B YBCs than in HER2+ and TNBC (p=2x10<sup>-94<\/sup> and 2x10<sup>-52<\/sup>, respectively), supporting the accuracy of the GeoMx assay. Compared to nulliparas or those with most recent birth &#62; 3 years before BC, those who gave birth &#8804; 3 years prior to BC had tumors with higher expression of PR (8x10<sup>-6<\/sup>) and ER (p=0.006), and lower expression of BCL-2 (p=0.006). In contrast, women with last birth &#8805; 6 years prior to BC had higher expression of CD8 (p=0.006) and PD-1 (p=0.001) than nulliparas and those with more recent births. Compared to women with BMI between 18.5 and 29.9, those with higher or lower BMIs had higher expression of CD34 (p=0.0003), CD4 (p=0.0009) and CD14 (p=0.001). BCL-2 expression was higher among women with BMI &#60; 18.5 compared to those with higher values (p=0.005). Women with BMI of 30+ had higher &#946;2-microglobulin levels than those with lower BMIs (p=0.003). Inverse dose-response associations (with higher BMI related to lower levels) were observed for expression of ER (p=0.01), pan cytokeratin (p=0.004) and four proteins in the p13K\/AKT signaling pathway (p &#8804; 0.01 for each).<br \/>Conclusions: Preliminarily, we identify differences in hormonal and immune markers in YBCs in relation to timing of births and BMI, suggesting that these factors may contribute to etiologic heterogeneity.

The etiology is attributed to multiple causes including exposure to passive smoking, parental smoking, asbestos and radon. However, these lung cancer cases do not fit the current United States Government-funded criterion of low-dose computed tomography that identifies early stages of lung cancer with higher survival following surgical removal.<br \/>Methods: The cancer urinary biomarkers, creatine riboside (CR) and N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA), were analyzed and quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine if never smokers with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can also be identified alongside tobacco smoker NSCLC cases as compared with gender and age-matched non-cancer population controls.<br \/>Results: These cancer biomarkers were significantly higher and comparable in never-smokers and tobacco smokers cases compared to population controls. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis in never smokers was equivalent for CR and NANA levels area under the curve (AUC) 0.91. In contrast, combined CR and NANA levels resulted in better predictive performance (AUC 0.94). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that high levels of CR and NANA were associated (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05) with increased cancer-specific death in never-smokers and tobacco smokers. Therefore these metabolites are independent of Tobacco smoking. NANA metabolite category factor, histology and stage were independent predictors of survival (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05) in multivariate analyses for never smokers as shown in Table 1.<br \/>Conclusions: These results indicate that measuring CR and NANA in liquid biopsy urine could identify never-smoking lung cancer candidates for LDCT screening and warrant prospective studies of these biomarkers in high-risk environments.<br \/>Table 1.

EHZ2 represents a new therapeutic target in FL and identifying candidates for EZH2 inhibition medication in the general hospital settings without access to genetic sequencing is critical. Since EZH2 regulates methylation at the 27<sup>th<\/sup> amino acid in Histone (H3K27), we evaluated the characteristics of EZH2 expression and H3K27 methylation in the Japanese FL cohort as well as their association with genetic characteristics. Prognostic impact of these factors on clinical outcomes was also examined.<br \/>[Method and Patients] A total of 164 patients (female, n=91; male, n=73) diagnosed with FL at Kyoto University Hospital between 2005 and 2020 were included. A total of 105 patients were assessed immunohistochemically using H-score for EZH2 expression (EZH2-score) and H3K27me3\/me2 scoring (Methylation-score). Impact of these scores at diagnosis on overall survival (OS) and progression\/relapse after the 1<sup>st<\/sup> immunochemotherapy were examined. We also performed next generation sequencing for 357 genes for 116 samples at diagnosis and examined their correlation with immunohistochemical characteristics.<br \/>[Results] Median age at diagnosis was 61 years (range, 33-86) and the median follow-up years was 7.5. Median EZH2-score was 70 (range, 0-290) and median Methylation-score was 2.38 (range, -4.25-4.95), with no apparent correlation. Twenty-five patients (21.6%) harbored <i>EZH2<\/i> mutations at diagnosis, all of which were in the mutation hotspots and showed a strong correlation with high Methylation-scores (p-value &#60; 0.001). Based on the prognostic impact of Methylation- and EZH2-score on survival, patients were divided into 3 groups: Group I, those with low Methylation-scores (&#60;2) and high EZH2-scores (&#8805;100); Group II, those with low Methylation-scores (&#60;2) and low EZH2-scores (&#60;100); Group III, those with high Methylation scores (&#8805;100). Group I showed inferior OS compared to Group III (p=0.038) with high risk of rapid relapse\/progression (62.5%) within 2 years, who frequently harbored mutations in <i>CSMD3<\/i> (vs Group III: p=0.004), <i>KMT2D<\/i> (p&#60;0.001) and <i>SETD1B<\/i> (p&#60;0.001). Distribution of mutated genes among Group III patients differed according to the existence of <i>EZH2<\/i> mutation, with high frequency of mutated <i>USH2A<\/i> (p=0.019) and <i>MGAM<\/i> (p=0.019) genes in those with <i>EZH2<\/i> mutation, whereas mutations in <i>TP53<\/i> were observed only in those without (p=0.072).<br \/>[Conclusion] Methylation-score could be helpful in distinguishing patients with and without <i>EZH2<\/i> mutations and enables clinicians to identify candidates for EZH2 inhibition medications. Combination of EZH2- and Methylation-scores predicts clinical outcomes after the 1<sup>st<\/sup> immunochemotherapy, which also could potentially identify genetically distinct population in the heterogeneous FL cohort.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Prognostic factors,Methylation,Gene profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mizuki Watanabe<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Naoki Goda<sup>2<\/sup>, Junya Kanda<sup>1<\/sup>, Akihiko Yoshizawa<sup>2<\/sup>, Momoko Nishikori<sup>1<\/sup>, Yasuhito Nannya<sup>3<\/sup>, Kenichi Yoshida<sup>4<\/sup>, Seishi Ogawa<sup>5<\/sup>, Hironori Haga<sup>2<\/sup>, Akifumi Takaori-Kondo<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Haemaotlogy and Oncology, Graduate school of medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Diagnostic Pathology, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Division of Hematopoietic Disease Control,, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>4<\/sup>Division of Cancer Evolution, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"aa521cc3-4d4a-48ba-8f3e-003d53cd8fda","ControlNumber":"6060","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

Since high expression of P4HA1 in PDAC is suggested to correlate with poor prognosis, targeting P4HA1 could have therapeutic benefits. Herein, we assessed the prognostic significance of P4HA1 expression at the RNA and protein levels in PDAC using publicly available data. We also evaluated the efficacy of diethyl-pythiDC, a small molecule inhibitor of P4HA1, in PDAC cells.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> UALCAN (ualcan.path.uab.edu), a comprehensive proteogenomic cancer data analysis portal, was used to obtain gene expression P4HA1 as transcripts per million reads (TPM) (PDAC n=178) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA); levels of P4HA1 protein expression data were obtained from (normal pancreas, n=74, PDAC n=137) the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis consortium (CPTAC). Immunohistochemical analysis obtained from Human Protein Atlas (HPA) confirmed increased P4HA1 protein expression. Overall survival (OS) between patients with high and low\/medium TPM (TPM values above and below upper quartile, respectively) and high and low protein expression score (based on staining intensity and fraction of stained cells) was calculated using the log-rank Wilcoxon test. To determine the efficacy of diethyl-pythiDC in PDAC cells (PANC-1 and BxPC-3), we performed clonogenic assay for colony formation, MTT assay for cell proliferation, flow cytometry for cell cycle analysis, and western blotting for markers of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>In the TCGA data, high P4HA1 expression (TPMs) was associated with a poor prognosis (high expression vs. low\/medium expression, log-rank <i>p<\/i>=0.009). Analysis of HPA data showed that the 5-year OS of patients with high P4HA1 expression was 12% vs. 58% for patients with low P4HA1 (log-rank <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001). CPTAC data showed higher P4HA1 protein expression in patients with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathway (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (<i>p<\/i>=0.045) and SWItch\/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI-SNF) complex (<i>p<\/i>=0.022) alterations. Diethyl-pythiDC treatment of PDAC cells reduced proliferation, decreased colony formation, and increased G2\/M cell cycle arrest. In addition, diethyl-pythiDC increased protein expression of E-cadherin, an epithelial marker, and decreased the expression of N-cadherin and vimentin, the mesenchymal protein markers.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Patients with high P4HA1 expression had poor OS. CPTAC data showed higher P4HA1 protein expression in patients with RTK, mTOR and SWI-SNF alterations. Targeting P4HA1 with diethyl-pythiDC reduced proliferation by arresting cells in G2\/M phase of the cell cycle and modulated EMT markers. Thus, targeting of P4HA1 can be a viable strategy and may be considered in future PDAC clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Prognosis,Oncogene,Drug sensitivity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Moh'd Khushman<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Farrukh Afaq<sup>2<\/sup>, Prachi Bajpai<sup>3<\/sup>, Sameer Al Diffalha<sup>4<\/sup>, Darryl Outlaw<sup>4<\/sup>, Grant  R.

While circulating levels of tryptophan metabolites have been associated with a decreased risk of CRC, epidemiological studies assessing tryptophan metabolites in relation to CRC outcomes are limited. In this study, we investigated associations between biomarkers of the tryptophan metabolism and clinical outcomes in prospectively followed, non-metastatic CRC patients.<br \/>Materials and Methods: A total of 2,102 patients with stage I-III CRC participated in six cohorts in the international FOCUS (folate dependent 1-carbon metabolism in colorectal cancer recurrence and survival) consortium. Preoperative circulating concentrations of tryptophan and its metabolites (kynurenine, kynurenic acid (KA), xanthurenic acid (XA), 3-hydroxy-anthralinic acid (HAA), anthranilic acid (AA), and picolinic acid (PA)) were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we examined associations of tryptophan metabolites with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Models were adjusted for patient age, sex, circulating creatinine levels, tumor site, tumor stage, and study site.<br \/>Results: After a median follow-up of 3.2 years for OS, higher tryptophan levels were associated with a 25-44% better overall and disease-free survival (hazard ratio, HR<sub>OS<\/sub>, 0.56; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.41-0.76, HR<sub>DFS<\/sub>, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57-0.99). Furthermore, the tryptophan metabolites XA and PA were associated with a better OS and DFS (XA: HR<sub>OS<\/sub>, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64-0.85, HR<sub>DFS<\/sub>, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.94; PA: HR<sub>OS<\/sub>, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64-0.92, HR<sub>DFS<\/sub>, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75-0.99). No statistically significant associations were found between kynurenine, KA, HAA, and AA concentrations and OS and DFS. The kynurenine-to-tryptophan ratio was positively associated with worse CRC survival (HR<sub>OS<\/sub>, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.57-2.88, HR<sub>DFS<\/sub>, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.01-1.73).<br \/>Conclusion: Higher preoperative circulating tryptophan and its metabolites XA and PA are associated with improved OS and DFS. Furthermore, the kynurenine-to-tryptophan ratio may represent a promising predictor for survival among stage I-III CRC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Survival,Prognostic markers,Molecular epidemiology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Victoria Damerell<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Stefanie Brezina<sup>2<\/sup>, Jennifer Ose<sup>3<\/sup>, Anne JMR Geijsen<sup>4<\/sup>, Arve Ulvik<sup>5<\/sup>, Eline  H.  van Roekel<sup>6<\/sup>, Andreana  N.

However, a subset of HPV-positive OPSCC patients still experience poor outcomes. Furthermore, HPV-negative OPSCC patients, who have an even higher risk of relapse, are still lacking suitable prognostic biomarkers for clinical outcome. Here, we evaluated the prognostic value of LINE-1 methylation level in OPSCC patients, and further addressed the relationship between LINE-1 methylation status and p53 protein expression as well as genome-wide\/gene-specific DNA methylation.<br \/>Results: In this study, DNA was extracted from 163 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples retrospectively collected from stage III-IVB OPSCC patients managed with curative intent with up-front treatment. Quantitative methylation-specific PCR revealed that LINE-1 hypomethylation was directly associated with poor prognosis (5-year overall survival - OS: 28.1% for LINE-1 methylation&#60;35% versus 69.1% for &#8805;55%; p&#60;0.0001). When LINE-1 methylation was dichotomized as &#60;55% vs. &#8805;55%, interaction with HPV16 emerged: compared with hypermethylated HPV-16 positive patients, subjects with hypomethylated HPV16-negative OPSCC reported an adjusted higher risk of death (HR: 4.83, 95% CI: 2.24-10.38) and progression (HR: 4.54, 95% CI: 2.18-9.48). Tumor protein p53 (TP53) gene is often mutated and overexpressed in HPV-negative OPSCC. Since p53 has been reported to repress LINE-1 promoter, we then analyzed the association between p53 protein expression and LINE-1 methylation levels. Following p53 immunohistochemistry, results indicated that among HPV16-negative patients with p53&#8805;50%, LINE-1 methylation levels declined and remained stable at approximately 43%; any HPV16-positive patient reported p53&#8805;50%. Finally, DNA methylation analysis demonstrated that genome-wide average methylation level at cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites was significantly lower in HPV16-negative OPSCC patients who relapsed within two years. The subsequent integrative analysis of gene expression and DNA methylation identified 20 up-regulated\/hypomethylated genes in relapsed patients, and most of them contained LINE-1 elements in their promoter sequences.<br \/>Conclusions: Evaluation of the methylation level of LINE-1 may help in identifying the subset of OPSCC patients with bad prognosis regardless of their HPV status. Aberrant LINE-1 hypomethylation might occur along with TP53 mutations, and lead to altered gene expression in OPSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Human papillomavirus (HPV),DNA methylation,TP53,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Mariateresa Casarotto<sup>1<\/sup>, Valentina Lupato<sup>2<\/sup>, Giorgio Giurato<sup>3<\/sup>, Roberto Guerrieri<sup>1<\/sup>, Sandro Sulfaro<sup>2<\/sup>, Annamaria Salvati<sup>3<\/sup>, Elisa D'Angelo<sup>4<\/sup>, Carlo Furlan<sup>5<\/sup>, Anna Menegaldo<sup>6<\/sup>, Lorena Baboci<sup>1<\/sup>, Barbara Montico<sup>1<\/sup>, Irene Turturici<sup>1<\/sup>, Riccardo Dolcetti<sup>7<\/sup>, Salvatore Romeo<sup>8<\/sup>, Vittorio Baggio<sup>9<\/sup>, Stefania Corrado<sup>4<\/sup>, Gianluca Businello<sup>9<\/sup>, Maria Guido<sup>10<\/sup>, Alessandro Weisz<sup>3<\/sup>, Vittorio Giacomarra<sup>2<\/sup>, Giovanni Franchin<sup>1<\/sup>, Agostino Steffan<sup>1<\/sup>, Luca Sigalotti<sup>1<\/sup>, Emanuela Vaccher<sup>1<\/sup>, Paolo Boscolo-Rizzo<sup>10<\/sup>, Jerry Polesel<sup>1<\/sup>, Giuseppe Fanetti<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Elisabetta Fratta<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Centro di Riferimento Oncologico IRCCS, Aviano, Italy,<sup>2<\/sup>General Hospital “S.

MiRNA-23b has been proposed to be expressed in various types of cancer. However, it&#8217;s prognostic role in several types of cancer has not been well identified. We conducted this meta-analysis to assess the associations between miRNA-23b expression and overall survival (OS) in various carcinoma. The current study presented the baseline characteristics and pooled survival results using a pooled hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Both Random and fixed effect models were conducted according to the heterogeneity of the analyzed. Then subgroup and publication bias analyses were executed. We identified a total sample size of 1589 in various carcinomas, including gastric (370), breast (203), ovarian (166), colorectal (206), renal (411), bladder (20), prostate (151) and lung cancer (62). The pooled HR of nine studies suggested that low miRNA-23b expression was obviously associated with worse OS (HR 3.2, 95% CI 2.26 to 4.53, P&#60;0.001) with a low statistical heterogeneity index (I2=53%, P=0.03) in most of cancer types. On the other hand, the other three remaining studies (gastric and breast cancer) showed that miRNA-23b high expression was associated with reduced OS (HR 1.59, 95%CI 1.07 to 2.37, P&#60;0.02) with no heterogeneity between the studies (I2=0%, P=0.38). All in all, our data showed that miRNA-23b was highly expressed in the plasma of breast and gastric cancer but was low expressed in most types of cancer. In addition, miRNA -23b expression is significantly associated with poor overall survival in several cancer types and might be considered as a potential prognostic marker.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prognosis,Prognostic markers,Prognostic factors,MicroRNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ahmed Mahmoud Wadaaallah<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ahmed Samir Sultan<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt,<sup>2<\/sup>Biochemistry, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"29170625-abe0-401b-ac25-5bf0db454637","ControlNumber":"3131","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

The molecular link between diabetes and PC has not been well established.<br \/>Methods: Bioinformatics screening was performed for a serum PC marker. Experiments in cell lines (5 PC and 1 normal cell lines), mouse models, and human tissue staining (37 PC and 10 normal cases) were performed to test asprosin production from PC. Asprosin&#8217;s diagnostic performance was tested with serums from multi-center cohorts (347 PC, 209 normal, and 55 additional diabetic patients) and evaluated according to PC status and stages which was compared with that of CA19-9.<br \/>Results: Asprosin, a diabetes-related hormone, was found from the bioinformatics screening, and its production from PC was confirmed. Serum asprosin levels from multi-center cohorts yielded an age-adjusted diagnostic area under the curve (AUC) of 0.987 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.961 to 0.997), superior to that of CA19-9 (AUC = 0.876, 95% CI = 0.847 to 0.905), and a cut-off of 7.18 ng\/mL, at which the validation set exhibited a sensitivity of 0.957 and a specificity of 0.924. Importantly, the performance was maintained in early stage PC, consistent with the tissue staining. A slightly lower performance against additional diabetic patients (n = 55) was restored by combining asprosin and CA19-9 (AUC = 0.985, 95% CI = 0.975 to 0.995).<br \/>Conclusion: Asprosin is presented as an early-stage PC serum marker that may provide clues for PC-induced diabetes. Larger prospective clinical studies are warranted to solidify its utility.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Biomarkers,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Min Seok Park<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kyung Hee Jung<sup>2<\/sup>, Sang Eun Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Yun Ji Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Sunghyouk Park<sup>3<\/sup>, Soon-Sun Hong<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Biomedical Science and Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>College of Medicine, Inha University, Incheon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2bd705f8-ee0c-4faa-927a-b3814f08c429","ControlNumber":"2343","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

However, little is known about the associations of circulating vitamin B biomarkers with clinical outcomes among CRC patients, such as overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and risk of recurrence. Recently, we showed that higher vitamin B<sub>6<\/sub> status is associated with improved OS and DFS. In the present study, we further investigated associations of vitamin B<sub>1<\/sub>, B<sub>2<\/sub>, and B<sub>3<\/sub> status with clinical outcomes in a prospective cohort of non-metastatic CRC patients.<br \/>Materials and Methods: A total of 2,102 patients with stage I-III CRC participated in six cohorts in the international FOCUS Consortium. Circulating concentrations of vitamin B biomarkers (thiamine and thiamine monophosphate (representing vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), and vitamin B3 markers N1-methylnicotinamide and nicotinamide were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in preoperative blood samples. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we examined associations of vitamin B<sub>1<\/sub>, B<sub>2<\/sub>, B<sub>3<\/sub> status, and related biomarkers with OS, DFS, and risk of recurrence. Models were adjusted for patient age, sex, circulating creatinine levels, tumor site, tumor stage, and study site.<br \/>Results and Discussion: After a median follow-up of 3.2 years for OS, higher levels of thiamine monophosphate were associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR<sub>OS<\/sub>: 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71-0.95, p=0.008). Furthermore, higher riboflavin levels were associated with improved OS (HR<sub>OS<\/sub>: 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78-0.98, p=0.03) and DFS (HR<sub>DFS<\/sub>: 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83-0.99, p=0.04). We did not observe any associations of thiamine, N1-methylnicotinamide, and nicotinamide with clinical outcomes among CRC patients.<br \/>Conclusion: Findings from this multi-centre study of non-metastatic CRC patients yield important clinical information. We observed significantly improved OS among patients with higher levels of thiamine monophosphate after CRC diagnosis. Further, higher preoperative riboflavin may represent a promising predictor for OS and DFS among non-metastatic CRC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Molecular epidemiology,Prognostic markers,Survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Biljana Gigic<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jennifer Ose<sup>2<\/sup>, Stefanie Brezina<sup>3<\/sup>, Anne JMR Geijsen<sup>4<\/sup>, Arve Ulvik<sup>5<\/sup>, Eline  H.  van Roekel<sup>6<\/sup>, Andreana  N.

It lacks sufficient diagnostic and prognostic markers, which leads to a poor prognosis. The survival rate of HCC patients is still low due to its highly metastatic nature. According to recent studies, non-coding RNAs play a vital role in cancer pathogenesis and may be a new diagnostic target for HCC. Circular RNA (circRNA) is a type of non-coding RNA with a closed loop structure formed by mRNA back-splicing. Its functions are miRNA sponging, translating to proteins and gene regulation. Recently, it has been found that circRNAs play a potential role at angiogenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance in many types of cancers. Thus, we aim to investigate the clinical relevance of hsa_circ_0116796 in HCC.Total RNAs from 100 pairs of HCC and corresponding normal liver (NL) tissues with different stages were extracted using QIAzol. CircRNA primers were coded including the gap junction for specificity. The expression levels were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and its expression was normalized with GAPDH. In addition, we analyzed the correlation between hsa_circ_0116796 expression and various clinicopathological features of HCC patients. The target miRNAs were predicted in silico analyses.We found that hsa_circ_0116796 was significantly decreased in HCC tumor tissues compared to corresponding NL tissues (P&#60;0.001). Suppression of hsa_circ_0116796 expression was associated with HCC progression (P&#60;0.001).

Although resistance mutations to BRAFi\/MEKi mainly occur in the MAPK and PI3K pathways, after progression on BRAFi\/MEKi drugs, targeting these mutations have been clinically unsuccessful. One possible cause of relapse is that a resistant subpopulation to BRAFi\/MEKi exists prior to treatment, raising the possibility that earlier counter-resistance treatment could be administered and potentially be more successful. However, the prevalence and clinical significance of pre-existing resistance is currently unknown in melanoma. To address this, we used quantitative blocker displacement amplification (qBDA) to quantify the VAF (down to 0.01% resolution) of resistant subclones along the MAPK\/PI3K pathways from FFPE biopsies on 149 metastatic melanoma patients. Due to possible intra-tumoral heterogeneity, multiple samples were taken when available per patient. Of 29 patients currently processed, 5\/29 (17%) had detectable NRAS Q61L or Q61R, 5\/29 (17%) had KRAS G12 or G13 mutations, and 3\/29 (10.3%) had PIK3CA H1047R\/Y. As expected, BRAF activating mutations were detectable in 29\/29 patients, while VAF of the resistant subclones were found to be as low as 0.16%. We expect some of the putative resistance mutations to be artifacts, and all will be validated by ddPCR. To model the behavior of low-VAF resistance mutations, we conducted in vitro<\/i> spike-in experiments using paired and labeled parental and BRAF\/MEK inhibitor-resistant melanoma lines. Our results show that even down to 0.1%, the resistant lines can rapidly emerge as the dominant population while under drug treatment. We also tested the timing of applying a counter-resistance therapy: early vs late. Earlier intervention led to a significant delay in growth of the resistant population, as expected. However, we are currently preparing an experiment that will determine whether an earlier intervention might not simply delay resistance, but also alter its strength, at different % VAFs. We therefore anticipate mechanistic analyses of how %VAF and drug timing can optimize counter-resistance therapies. Overall, our interim data suggest a significant percentage of metastatic BRAF-mutated melanoma patients may harbor pre-existing resistant subclones, and that early treatment with counter-resistance therapy can potentially delay resistance to targeted therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Resistance,Targeted sequencing,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Michael Nakazawa<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lauren Cheng<sup>2<\/sup>, Mishal Ahmed<sup>2<\/sup>, Rossana Lazcano<sup>3<\/sup>, Khalida Wani<sup>3<\/sup>, Omid Veiseh<sup>4<\/sup>, Lawrence Kwong<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Cancer Medicine, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>Rice University, Houston, TX,<sup>3<\/sup>Translational Molecular Pathology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>4<\/sup>Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1808f224-f08e-4e53-8cdc-f2f9c432ab92","ControlNumber":"894","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Nucleosomes are basic elements of chromatin, composed of 147bp DNA wrapped around an octamer of histones. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and nucleosomes are released into the bloodstream upon cell death. In addition to genetic somatic alterations, epigenetic modifications are found to play a key role in tumorigenesis of different cancers. The trimethylated histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27Me3) is well known as a transcription-repressive mark and proven to be involved in tumorigenesis, cell cycle progression and proliferation dysregulation. However, the concentration of circulating nucleosomes, as a biomarker of the contributive value of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) molecular profiling in patient management at diagnosis has not previously been investigated.<br \/>Patients and Methods: Plasmas were retrospectively collected from patients with NSCLC at initial diagnosis before treatment (CIRCAN&#8217;s cohort, N= 198) and from healthy donors (N=100). We carried out targeted next&#8208;generation sequencing (NGS) on paired plasmas. Samples were divided in two sub-groups based on the genetic results: ctDNA negative or positive for presence of somatic alterations. The concentration of global circulating nucleosomes as well as specific methylated marks: H3K4Me2-, H3K9Me3-, H3K27Me3- or H3K36Me3-nucleosomes were measured using chemiluminescent Nu.Q&#174; immunoassays (Belgian Volition SRL, Belgium).<br \/>Results: Among all the different nucleosome forms evaluated, the highest coefficient correlations with cfDNA concentration were observed for H3K27Me3-nucleosomes (r=0.72, p&#60;0.0001). At a cut-off of 14 ng\/ml of H3K27Me3-nucleosomes Nu.Q&#174; assay showed a sensitivity of 69.2% (n=137) at 95% specificity for lung cancers vs healthy donors (AUC= 0.92). Interestingly, by combining H3K37Me3 level and ctDNA molecular profile, we found a contributive diagnostic value of molecular profiling results in 77% of the plasmas versus only 40% using NGS alone as per current practice. 32% of plasmas were positive for both H3K27Me3 and ctDNA; 37% are H3K27Me3-positive but ctDNA-negative; 8% of the samples were ctDNA-positive\/H3K27Me3-negative and 23% are negative for both H3K27Me3 and ctDNA.<br \/>Conclusions: High levels of Nu.Q&#174; H3K27Me3 and the absence of detecting somatic alterations strongly support the presence of non-mutated ctDNA in the corresponding plasma. This greatly improves the confidence in the negative molecular results in cfDNA in LC. This may allow the indication of individualized therapeutic regimens with a short-time medical decision and may reduce invasive tissue re-biopsies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27Me3),ctDNA Molecular Profiling,Nucleosomes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Arnaud Gauthier<sup>1<\/sup>, Julie Candiracci<sup>2<\/sup>, Emmanuel Grolleau<sup>1<\/sup>, Gaelle Lescuyer<sup>1<\/sup>, David Barthelemy<sup>1<\/sup>, Christine Haon<sup>1<\/sup>, Florence Geiduer<sup>1<\/sup>, Margaux Raffin<sup>1<\/sup>, Nathalie Hardat<sup>2<\/sup>, Julie Balandier<sup>1<\/sup>, Rémi Rabeuf<sup>2<\/sup>, Anne-Sophie Wozny<sup>1<\/sup>, Claire Rodriguez-Lafrasse<sup>1<\/sup>, Guillaume Rommelaere<sup>2<\/sup>, Fabien Subtil<sup>1<\/sup>, Sébastien Couraud<sup>1<\/sup>, Marielle Herzog<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Lea Payen-Gay<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud - HCL, Pierre Benite, France,<sup>2<\/sup>Belgian Volition, SRL, Isnes, Belgium","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1c8e12d1-535c-47b0-b431-fe43bcfa1f5e","ControlNumber":"2589","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Tumors harboring these molecular profiles are also associated with specific clinical-pathological features well described in literature [2; 3] and treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) represent the therapy with the highest expected benefit [4; 5; 6; 7; 8]. This subgroup of population represents almost 5% of the entire population of mCRC patients (pts) [9; 10]. About the remaining 95% of the population, for which immunotherapy doesn&#8217;t seem to improve outcome [4; 10; 11; 12], we know that a subgroup of pts reported high TMB, not related to MSS\/MMRp or mutation in Polymerase genes [1]. For this subgroup data are scarce in the literature.<br \/>Methods: We selected a case series of MSS\/MMRp, non-POLE\/POLD1 mCRC cases with documented TMB &#62;= 10mut\/Mb at comprehensive genomic profiling tested with Foundation Medicine panel between January 2019 and June 2022. Clinical-pathological features were collected from clinical reports and evaluated with descriptive statistics. Two pathologists reviewed the slides to assess histopathological features.<br \/>Results: 24 out of 693 (3.5%) pts had MSS\/MMRp, non-POLE\/POLD1 mCRC with TMB &#62;= 10 Mut\/Mb. Average TMB was 19.04 mut\/Mb (10 - 104.65 mut\/Mb). 56% were male; median age at mCRC diagnosis was 58 years old (IQR 48-64 yo). 16 pts had left-side primary tumor, 6 of which had rectal cancer. 14 had synchronous metastases and the most frequent stage parameters were T3\/4 and N+. The following histotypes were documented: 18\/24 were adenocarcinoma NOS, 3\/24 mucinous, 1\/24 of cribriform comedonecrosis type, 1\/24 a mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasm (MiNen) and 1\/24 not assessable. With regard to grading, 12\/24 high-grade cases and 11\/24 low-grade cases, 1 case not assessable. 7\/18 assessable cases had high tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) (&#62;=2.0 TILs\/HPF) and 18\/18 assessable cases showed signs of lympho-vascular invasion.According to comprehensive molecular profiling, the 5 most frequent genes altered were APC (80.0%), TP53 (72.0%), KRAS (24.0%), SMAD2\/4 (24.0%), PIK3CA (24.0%). 3 pts had BRAF V600E mutations. In our case study, 23 out of 24 pts started 1st line treatment for metastatic disease, of which 21 with poli-chemo schedules. Data about best response were available for 21 cases and ORR was 61.9%, DCR 90.4%. Median PFS was 13.6 months (IQR 5.6 - 25.9). Median OS was 47.2 months (IQR 25.7 - 63.3).<br \/>Conclusion: MSS\/MMRp, non-POLE\/POLD1, TMB &#62;= 10 mut\/Mb is a small but defined subgroup of mCRCs. To better understand the molecular behavior of this rare subgroup of cancers, further study should investigate the underlying mechanism, the TMB cut-off relevance in mCRC and the potential predictive impact on immunotherapy efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor mutational burden,Immunotherapy,Colorectal cancer,Predictive biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Giulia Maddalena<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Valentina Angerilli<sup>2<\/sup>, Gianmarco Ricagno<sup>1<\/sup>, Aldo Montagna<sup>3<\/sup>, Riccardo Cerantola<sup>1<\/sup>, Giada Munari<sup>2<\/sup>, Sara Lonardi<sup>4<\/sup>, Francesca Bergamo<sup>5<\/sup>, Matteo Fassan<sup>6<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Medical Oncology Unit 1, Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV - IRCCS; Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy,<sup>2<\/sup>University Hospital of Padua, Padua, Italy,<sup>3<\/sup>Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV-IRCCS, Padua, Italy,<sup>4<\/sup>Medical Oncology Unit 3, Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV, Padua, Italy,<sup>5<\/sup>Medical Oncology Unit 1, Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV - IRCCS, Padua, Italy,<sup>6<\/sup>University Hospital of Padua; Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV - IRCCS,, Padua, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"35e17af5-7bf0-4ed4-9402-0b0dd0eb958d","ControlNumber":"6321","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>G.

Among the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, EVT801 has shown compelling activity in a wide range of cancer models and favorable preclinical toxicology profile. A phase I clinical study (NCT05114668) is underway to characterize safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics of EVT801, and explore patient stratification which will be key for further development. Literature reports VEGFR-3 expression in several tumor cells - especially in kidney and liver cancers. However, we did not detect VEGFR-3 in tumor cells in translational <i>in vivo<\/i> models we explored (i.e., chemo-induced liver cancer and panel of PDX models). To clarify the situation, we validated a highly specific protocol for VEGFR-3 immunohistochemistry labelling, readily transferable to clinical centers.<br \/>Results: We evaluated many different tumor types, and eventually focused our analysis on kidney cancer and soft tissue sarcomas. Initially, VEGFR-3 expression was assessed in 29 primary kidney cancer samples and 23 metastatic kidney cancer samples with CD34 to stain vessels and D2-40 to track lymphatics. We detected VEGFR-3 expression in the endothelial cells within the kidney tumor but not in the tumor cells. Remarkably, we observed a very distinct delineation between the kidney tumor vasculature, which showed high VEGFR-3 expression, and the normal adjacent tissue, which was devoid of VEGFR-3 expression. All vessels around and in the tumor were stained by CD34, whereas D2-40 staining was limited to the peritumoral regions. In addition, we found that VEGFR-3 expression in metastases from kidney tumors matched the expression pattern of the primary tumor. This held true even in patients treated with sunitinib, positioning EVT801 as a potential treatment option after failure of such multi tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Among the samples from 103 patients with soft tissue sarcomas, VEGFR-3 was generally highly expressed; however, 3 distinct groups emerged: i) tumors with high VEGFR-3 expression in tumor cells, tumor vessels and peritumoral vessels; ii) tumors with high expression in all vessels (tumor and peritumoral) but not in the tumor cells (similar to kidney tumors); iii) tumors with intermediate expression in peritumoral vessels.<br \/>Conclusion: We were able to quantify VEGFR-3 expression in the kidney and soft tissue sarcoma cohorts plus several others, such as hepatocarcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer. This enables us selecting indications that might benefit from EVT801 as a monotherapy (e.g., clear cell renal cell carcinoma and soft tissue sarcomas) or in combination with standard of care. Accordingly, VEGFR-3 expression is retrospectively quantified during EVT801 clinical trial phase 1 trial and may be used to stratify patients in the future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunohistochemistry,Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor,Kidney cancer,Angiogenesis inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"michael Paillasse<sup>1<\/sup>, pierre-benoit Ancey<sup>1<\/sup>, Gaelle Badet<sup>1<\/sup>, Anne Gomez-Brouchet<sup>2<\/sup>, Janik Selves<sup>3<\/sup>, philippe Rochaix<sup>2<\/sup>, Maxime Battistella<sup>4<\/sup>, Celeste Lebbe<sup>4<\/sup>, philippe Cassier<sup>5<\/sup>, carlos Gomez-Roca<sup>2<\/sup>, Jean-Pierre Delord<sup>2<\/sup>, Mark Whittaker<sup>6<\/sup>, Lise Davenne<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>John Friend<\/b><sup>7<\/sup>, Michael Fitzgerald<sup>7<\/sup>, James Garner<sup>7<\/sup>, Pierre Fons<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Evotec SE, Toulouse, France,<sup>2<\/sup>Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France,<sup>3<\/sup>Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse Oncopole, Evotec SE, Toulouse, France,<sup>4<\/sup>Université de Paris Cité, AP-HP Hôpital Saint Louis, INSERM U976, Paris, France,<sup>5<\/sup>Centre Léon Bérard, Lyon, France,<sup>6<\/sup>Evotec SE, Abingdon, United Kingdom,<sup>7<\/sup>Kazia Therapeutics Ltd, Sydney, Australia","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"fd060ead-2b8d-41b5-b83d-136931b557f0","ControlNumber":"794","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

Its incidence and mortality rate is constantly increasing in this country. This requires the determination of clinical and molecular prognostic factors of CC in our context. Studies indicate that mutations in the RAS genes (KRAS and NRAS) represent such a factor. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prognostic impact of KRAS and NRAS mutations on overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS) and metastasis-free survival (MFS) of CC patients.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>This study involved a series of 210 patients with colon cancer. The clinical and pathological data were obtained from of each patient&#8217;s files at the molecular pathology department of the CHU HASSAN II of FES. For molecular data, full RAS status was determined by direct sequencing and Q24 pyrosequencing, after extraction of DNA from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue. The evaluation of the relationship between OS, RFS, and MFS and the molecular and clinical factors of the patients was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>The average age of our patients was 57.5 &#177; 14.6 years. A slight male predominance was found (52.7%). 39.5% of the cases had a mutation in one of the RAS genes. Mutation of exon 2 of the <i>KRAS <\/i>gene was the most frequent with a percentage of 36.6%. The NRAS gene was mutated in 2.8% of our patients. The exon 2 mutated tumors were significantly associated with female gender (p=0.04), and left location (p=0.04) compared to the other exons. The mean OS, RFS, and MFS were 100.0%, 92.0% and 92.1% respectively. OS was significantly longer in tumors with KRAS exon 4 mutations compared to tumors with other types of RAS mutations and was also associated with right colon tumors (P=0.001), localized stages I-II (P=0.001), tumors without metastatic nodes (P=0.03), and MSI tumors (P=0.01). For RFS and MFS, localized stage and tumors without metastatic nodes were good prognostic factors (p=0.002, p=0.000). However, the type of mutated exon had no prognostic impact on either.<br \/><b>Conclusion <\/b>In our setting right location, localized stage, absence of metastatic nodes, MSI status and mutated status of exon 4 of the KRAS gene (compared to other exons) are all predictive factors of better overall survival of colon cancer in Morocco. The type of the mutated exon of the RAS genes has no impact on RFS and MFS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colon cancer,Biomarkers,Prognostic factors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Fatima El Agy<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Laila Chbani<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah Fez, Fes, Morocco,<sup>2<\/sup>University Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah Fez, FES, Morocco","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"406007e8-9c0f-4d49-b599-21a3344bb783","ControlNumber":"5982","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

Furthermore, immune cell phenotyping of the tumor microenvironment is becoming a tool not only for the identification of novel predictive biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy, but also for prognostic markers that may help to understand several mechanisms like invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We demonstrate how multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF) assays and digital image analysis helped to investigate tumor budding in colorectal cancer by evaluating the tumor microenvironment and activated fibroblasts. Akoya Bioscience&#8217;s Opal detection system and fluorophores were optimized on LEICA Bond RX for use with human normal tonsil control tissues and FFPE colorectal cancer specimens. The 6-plex mIF panel included CD4 (clone SP35), CD8 (clone C8\/144B), CD68 (clone PG-M1), FoxP3 (clone SP97), PD-L1 (clone SP263) and pan-Cytokeratin (clones AE1\/AE3). In addition, FAP-alpha single-plex IHC was used to investigate reactivity of the stroma surrounding tumor cell buds.&#8239; Each single marker of the mIF panel was independently validated for specificity regarding stripping efficacy and epitope stability, and for accuracy compared to single plex bright field immunohistochemistry. &#8239;Automated image analysis and cellular phenotyping followed a workflow of custom Visiopharm apps. The tissue was segmented into regions of interest, such as areas with and without tumor cell budding, and bud microenvironment.&#8239;Additional parameters like MSI (Microsatellite Instability) status and TNM classification were also taken into consideration for data analysis. The applied mIF immune cell panel and automated image analysis workflow identified a broad number of different immune cell phenotypes, including rare double- or triple-positive cell subtypes, as well as their spatial relation to tumor cell buds within the activated stroma region. This revealed new insights into the complexity of the tumor microenvironment in colorectal cancer around tumor cell buds, suggesting a potential effect of both the immune system and the stromal cells on tumor cell invasion into the surrounding tissue.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiplex automation,Microenvironment,Colorectal cancer,Image analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dirk Zielinski<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Rebekka Vogtmann<sup><\/sup>, Anne Siemon<sup><\/sup>, Christina Koppel<sup><\/sup>, Christina Schipper<sup><\/sup>, Anastasiia Tereshchenko<sup><\/sup>, Suso Platero<sup><\/sup>, Hans-Ulrich Schildhaus<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Assay Development, Discovery Life Sciences, Huntsville, AL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e5d63864-5ec2-4302-84bd-820702b1c20e","ControlNumber":"4261","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

First, size of RT and TB was measured, lymph node metastasis and residual intraductal carcinoma in situ were noted. Additional parameters that were examined were cell density and cell shape of RT, heterogeneity of residual tumor cells spreading within the TB and size of the biggest cell clusters as well as changes of the stroma and inflammation within the TB.<br \/>Data were used pseudo-anonymized after consent was given by the patients and a positive vote of the ethics committee.<br \/>In the univariate observation of above-mentioned variables it was shown that heterogeneity, cell density and cell shape of residual tumor cells, stroma changes and the presence of lymph node metastases as well as largest diameter and largest cluster of RT have an impact on progression free survival. Using decision tree analysis, the patient cohort could be divided in three risk groups with significant different outcome regarding progression free survival with low, intermediate and high risk for an event (local recurrence of disease, metastasis, death).

Previous NGS-based studies targeting fixed genomic regions had reported that circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) could provide evidence for prognosis prediction during HCC treatment. However, the sensitivity of methods was limited and could not reach the threshold of minimal residual disease (MRD) test. Here we reported a baseline tissue -informed ctDNA NGS assay, detecting MRD in HCC patients who received hepatectomy and predicted prognosis in MRD positive patients.<br \/>Methods: The study retrospectively enrolled 200 early-stage HCC patients who received surgical resections. Tumor and normal tissue samples were collected respectively through surgery. Plasma samples were collected 7 days or more post-surgery. In the completed pilot study, samples from 17 patients were tested by a baseline tissue-informed MRD assay (PredicineBEACON). Tumor-specific mutations were identified by whole exon sequencing on baseline tumor and normal tissue samples. For each patient, up to 50 mutations were selected through bioinformatics pipelines for personalized MRD panel design, in combination with a fixed panel of 500 tumor actionable hotspots. The post-surgery plasma samples were then tested for MRD with the panel through ultra-deep sequencing(100,000X). Afterward, genomic tumor fraction proportions were calculated.<br \/>Results: In the completed pilot study, 12 of 17 patients (70.6%) were called MRD positive based on tests of post-surgery plasma. Among MRD positive patients, 3 were identified as MRD risk high (proportion of tumor fraction&#8805;0.1%) and MRD risk of others were moderate (proportion of tumor fraction&#60;0.1%). The tumor fraction proportion of MRD positive patients varied from 0.013% to 17.84% (median 0.042%). The recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) probabilities were significantly correlated with MRD risk: the median RFS of two groups(risk-high vs. risk-moderate) was 10.1 months vs. 57.4 months (p-value&#60;0.001), while the median OS of two groups (risk-high vs. risk-moderate) was 31.2 months vs. 57.4 months(p-value=0.028).<br \/>Conclusions: Baseline-informed ctDNA NGS assay showed ultra-sensitive capability of MRD detection on early-stage HCC patients, with outstanding positive rate through plasma samples collected 7 days post-surgery. The MRD risk provided significant prognostic evidence for patient survival and disease relapse.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell-free DNA,Minimal Residual Disease (MRD),Personalized Assay,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jie Hu<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Haoran Tang<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, Feng Xie<sup>2<\/sup>, Yue Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Shidong Jia<sup>2<\/sup>, Jian Zhou<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Liver Surgery and Transplantation, Liver Cancer Institute, Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Huidu (Shanghai) Medical Sciences, Ltd., Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"948294f4-82da-40ea-9fd1-b30952f81aad","ControlNumber":"3283","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.
