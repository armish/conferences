TLSs are heterogenous organized lymphoid aggregates, their mature form containing a germinal center with follicular B cells juxtaposing CD4+ follicular helper T cells and intricated with CD21+CD23+ follicular dendritic cells. We investigated the impact of TLS on responses to immunotherapy.<br \/>By performing a large-scale retrospective analysis of three independent cohorts of patients with different cancer types (including soft-tissue sarcomas, lung, bladder, colorectal, head and neck, breast cancer and others, n &#62; 500) treated with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies, we showed that the presence of mature TLSs was associated with higher objective response rates (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), independently of PD-L1 expression status and CD8+ T cell density.<br \/>To decipher the role of B cells in supporting responses to immunotherapy by immune check-point blockers and patients&#8217; survival, we focused on two cancers: clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) and Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS):The randomized phase II BIONIKK trial (NCT02960906) has recently shown that molecular grouping of tumors enabled enhanced response rate to Nivolumab (N), Nivolumab + Ipilimumab (NI) and VEGFR-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) in patients with frontline metastatic RCC (mRCC). 199 pts were randomized and treated with N (40 pts), NI (101pts) and TKI (58pts). After a median follow-up of 46.5 months, 86 (43%) patients died: 27\/58 (46.5%), 39\/101 (39%) and 20\/40 (50%) in the N, NI, and TKI arm, respectively. Median OS was 35 months with N, not reached with NI and 45 months with TKI. 160\/199 mRCC patients had available FFPE samples (N: 42, NI: 84, TKI: 34). In N-treated patients, number of TLS&#62;2 was associated with higher ORR (73% versus 15%, p=0.01), longer PFS (p=0.015) and less upfront progressions (no progression at 6 weeks, p=0.02). In patients treated with NI, TLS&#62;2 correlated with higher ORR (71% versus 40%, p=0.02), fewer events of early progressions (no progression at 6 months) (p=0.04) and a high TLS transcriptomic signature correlated with higher ORR (79%) versus 25% in TKI-treated patients. Analyzing Immunoglobulin (Ig) gene expression and repertoire, we showed that TLS+ tumors depicted higher numbers of IgM, IgG1 and IgA unique clonotypes and a higher number of over-represented clones found more than 30 times in the same tumor. We also performed spatial transcriptomics and examined the nature of B cell responses within TLS structures. B cells were enriched inside TLS, and therein we could identify all B cell maturation stages from na&#239;ve B cells to plasma cells (PCs) formation. B cell repertoire analysis revealed clonal diversification, selection, expansion in TLS and the presence of fully mature clonotypes at distance. In TLS+ tumors, IgG producing PCs disseminated into the tumor beds along fibroblastic tracks. TLS+ tumors exhibited high frequencies of IgG-producing PCs and high numbers of IgG-stained and apoptotic malignant cells, suggestive of anti-tumor effector activity. Proximity analyses revealed the presence of activated macrophages located close to IgG-coated cleaved caspase 3 positive tumor cells, reflecting activation of antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Patients with high numbers of IgG-stained tumor cells (above 60%) exhibited higher ORR (62% versus 18%, p=0.03) and PFS (17 versus 6 months, p=0.03) when treated with NI.PEMBROSARC is a multi-cohort phase II study of pembrolizumab combined with low-dose cyclophosphamide in patients with advanced STS. The 6-months non-progression rate (NPR) and the ORR previously reported in cohorts including all comers were 4.9% and 2.4%, respectively. In the cohort enrolling patients selected based on the presence of TLS, the 6-month NPR was 40% and the ORR was 30%. Exploratory analyses revealed that infiltration by mature dendritic cells, activated macrophages and IgG -producing PCs was associated with improved clinical outcome. the Presence of IgG antibodies on tumor cells was documented in some cases.<br \/>Altogether, these data establish that maturation, selection and amplification of B cells in intratumoral TLSs results in PC generation which may produce anti-tumor antibodies. Macrophage-dependent killing of tumor cells results in the release of immune complexes of IgG with tumor-associated antigens; the latter are endocytosed by dendritic cells that present tumor-specific and self-antigens to T cells in a very efficient way, amplifying &#8220;in situ&#8221; antitumor immune responses and lowering the threshold for T lymphocytes reinvigoration by anti-checkpoint inhibitors. It represents an amplification loop that may reinforce therapeutic responses to checkpoint inhibitors, particularly in tumors with low mutational burden. Mechanisms underlying B cell maturation, plasma cell generation and antibody production and their regulation in TLS will be discussed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-12 Tumor-immune system interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"B cells,Immune checkpoint blockade,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Kidney cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wolf Herman Fridman<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maxime Meylan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yann Vano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guilhem Pupier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antoine Bougouin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Calvez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Florent Petitprez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cheng Ming Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Margot Mathieu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lucile Vanhersecke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>François Le Loarer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alban Bessede<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephane Oudard<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antoine Italiano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Catherine Sautès-Fridman<\/i><\/presenter>.
