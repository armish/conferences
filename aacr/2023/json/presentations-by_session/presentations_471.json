[{"Abstract":"Large case-control and familial studies have established clear cancer-specific risk profiles for several key cancer predisposition genes (CPGs). For example, germline pathogenic variants (PVs) in <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> (<i>gBRCA<\/i>) are associated with increased risk for developing breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. However, the extent to which <i>gBRCA<\/i> mutations are involved in mediating the tumorigenesis of other cancer types remains challenging to characterize. We hypothesized that integrating orthogonal features such as selection for biallelic inactivation of the PVs and depletion of canonical somatic drivers among the carriers can enrich the signal for identifying novel gene and cancer type associations. We then extend this framework to identify novel CPGs as well as to understand how tumors arise in patients with PVs in oncogenes.<br \/>To study this, we leveraged the prospective MSK-IMPACT matched tumor-normal sequencing cohort of 49,291 patients across 77 major cancer types. We study 90 well-known CPGs as well as &#62;300 cancer genes not previously associated with cancer predisposition.<br \/>Overall, 8% (N=3,964) of patients harbored a PV in high or moderate penetrance CPGs. We identified 90 gene and cancer type associations with enrichment for biallelic inactivation (<i>q<\/i>&#60;0.05), including 19 novel findings among clinically actionable genes. For example, we find enrichment for biallelic inactivation of <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> in unexpected lineages such as hepatobiliary, endometrioid, and ampullary cancers. These tumors were also significantly depleted for somatic gain-of-function driver alterations. Hepatobiliary cancers with <i>gBRCA1<\/i> mutations were also enriched for somatic loss of <i>NF1<\/i>.<br \/>Among carriers of PVs in oncogenes, we observe two possible mechanisms of first somatic hit towards malignant transformation. We find enrichment for copy number gain or copy neutral loss of heterozygosity of the germline PV in thyroid cancers with a PV in <i>RET<\/i>. We also find that lung cancers with a germline PV in <i>EGFR <\/i>frequently developed additional somatic point mutations located <i>in cis<\/i> with the PV.<br \/>Investigating genes with no prior association with germline predisposition to cancer, we find evidence for <i>KEAP1 <\/i>and <i>CIC <\/i>as likely novel CPGs. Lung (n=8) and thyroid (n=4) cancers with deleterious germline variants in <i>KEAP1 <\/i>were characterized by loss of the wild-type allele, co-occurring somatic <i>STK11<\/i> mutations, and depletion of canonical drivers such as <i>EGFR<\/i>. We also found biallelic loss of <i>CIC <\/i>in two patients with Neuroblastoma, each carrying a different germline loss-of-function mutation in <i>CIC<\/i>. Both tumors were also negative for <i>MYCN <\/i>and <i>ALK <\/i>defects.<br \/>Collectively, our findings expand our understanding of cancer predisposition in cancer, shed new insights into how tumors arise in germline carriers, and provide a framework for identifying new CPGs using population scale tumor-normal paired clinical sequencing data.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-08 Familial and hereditary cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genetic susceptibility,BRCA,Hereditary cancer,MSK-IMPACT,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Miika Mehine<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Rebecca Caeser<sup><\/sup>, Yelena Kemel<sup><\/sup>, Daniel Muldoon<sup><\/sup>, Sebastià Franch-Expósito<sup><\/sup>, A.

Because of the rarity of the disease, there were limited data on the types of the mutation, clinical features and treatment outcomes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical characteristics and prognosis in Korean patients with germline TP53 gene mutation.<br \/>Methods: Patients who underwent genetic counseling and confirmed with TP53 gene mutation in National Cancer Center in Korea between 2011 and 2022 were reviewed retrospectively. Data on family history with pedigree, types of mutation, clinical features and prognosis were collected.<br \/>Results: Fourteen patients with LFS were included in the study. Missense mutations were shown in 13 cases and nonsense mutation in 1 case. The repeated mutations were p.Arg273His (n=2), p.Ala138Val (n=2) and pPro190Leu (n=2). A sister with breast cancer had the same mutation of p.Ala138Val. The median age at diagnosis of first tumor in 14 LFS patients was 32 (1-67) years. Seven patients (50%) had multiple primary cancers. Breast cancer was most frequently observed (n=9) and other types of tumor included sarcoma (n=5), thyroid cancer (n=3), pancreatic cancer (n=2), ovarian cancer (n=1), endometrial cancer (n=1), colon cancer (n=1), brain tumor (n=1), adrenocortical carcinoma (n=1), vaginal cancer (n=1), skin cancer (n=1) and leukemia (n=1). The median follow-up period was 51.5 (6-188) months. There were two cases of local recurrence and four cases of distant metastasis during the periods. Two patients died from leukemia and pancreatic cancer at three months and 23 months after diagnosis, respectively.<br \/>Conclusion: As known in other countries, many Korean patients with LFS also had an early onset and multiple primary tumors. And patients showed various types of mutation, clinical features and prognostic outcomes. Further large-scale studies are required for proper screening and management in Korean patients with LFS.

We hypothesized that there is also an interaction between them, with genetic variants influencing dietary choices. The dopamine transporter 1 (<i>DAT1<\/i>) and D4 subtype of the dopamine receptor (<i>DRD4<\/i>) genes are polymorphic, with a variable number of nucleotide repeats (VNTR) that affect dopaminergic neurotransmission, and reward circuitry for food cravings. Specifically, the 9-tandem repeats (9R) allele of DAT1 and the 7-tandem repeats (7R) allele of DRD4 are risk factors for eating disorders or undereating behavior in children. The goal of this study was to determine whether these polymorphisms are associated with altered dietary intake during therapy for childhood ALL. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from 439 children being treated on Dana Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 05-001 (NCT00400946). Target alleles in DAT1 and DRD4 were determined using PCR product length analysis. Each subject was classified as having either zero or at least one copy of the target alleles. Dietary intake was previously determined using food frequency questionnaires collected at three timepoints: time of diagnosis, end of induction, and continuation therapy. As previously published dietary composition in fat and carbohydrate differed significantly among three timepoints. There was no significant difference between those with or without the target alleles in DAT1 or DRD4 in percent from fat or percent from carbohydrate at any of the three timepoints. However, significant differences were observed when dietary intake was compared to the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI). Notably, a greater portion of male participants with DAT1 9R polymorphism had fat consumption below the DRI at the time of diagnosis. On the contrary, significantly decreased portion of females with DAT1 9R had fat consumption below the DRI during continuation therapy. When compared to normative values, a significantly increased number of children had total calorie consumption below DRI during induction therapy. The DRD4 7R polymorphism was associated with fat intake below DRI during induction therapy in males. However, neither DAT1 nor DRD4 polymorphisms were related to variation in carbohydrates consumption. In addition, a greater portion of participants that carry both DAT1 and DRD4 polymorphism exhibited a trend toward undereating behavior in fat intake compared to the controls. Our results are the first to indicate that DAT1 and DRD4 polymorphisms are associated with altered dietary intake during chemotherapy for childhood ALL. Future study will further elucidate whether this modulation is associated with changes in their body weight, BMI, glucose level, and disease relapse.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-10 Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute lymphoblastic,Genetic polymorphism,Pediatric cancers,Diet,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jing Wen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Arul Duggimpudi<sup>2<\/sup>, Shengguo Li<sup>3<\/sup>, Elena Ladas<sup>4<\/sup>, Kara  M.

High red meat and\/or processed meat consumption are established risk factors for CRC. Genome-wide association studies have identified over 200 genetic variants that explain ~20% of the variability in CRC risk. However, few large studies have evaluated genome-wide gene by environment (GxE) interactions with meat in CRC. Using the largest CRC pooled dataset available to date we conducted a genome-wide GxE analysis to identify possible interactions between common variants and red meat and\/or processed meat intake and CRC risk.<br \/>Methods: A pooled sample of 29,912 CRC cases and 39,704 unaffected controls of European (EUR) ancestry from 27 studies was analyzed. Sex- and study-specific quartiles for red meat and processed meat intake were constructed from harmonized questionnaire data on meat consumption. Genotyping arrays were imputated to the Haplotype Reference Consortium. To identify novel CRC interaction loci we used the two-step EDGE method, standard GxE analyses and a 1-3 degrees of freedom (DF) test . We removed previously known GWAS hits and SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium with them.<br \/>Results: Our Meta-analyses confirmed a positive association between quartile consumption increase of red meat and processed meat with CRC risk (Red meat OR = 1.30; 95%CI = 1.21-1.41; Processed meat OR = 1.40; 95% CI = 1.20 -1.63). Greater magnitude in point estimates were observed for case-control studies compared to cohort studies, for processed meat consumption among men compared to women, and for red meat consumption and distal colon localization compared to proximal colon or rectum. Two DF GxE tests of red meat consumption revealed two SNPs in chromosome (Chr) 8 (rs4871179 &#38; rs75212442) and a SNP in Chr10 (rs117674361) that map downstream HAS2, COLEC10 and downstream CCSER2. In addition, the two-step EDGE GxE method identified the rs35352860 SNP that maps to the SMAD7 gene in Chr18. Genotype-stratified analyses showed that the red meat and CRC risk association was restricted to homozygous carriers of major alleles for rs4871179, rs75212442 &#38; rs117674361. Moreover, we observed dose-response increase in the red meat and CRC risk association with additional copies of the T allele of the SNP in Chr18, with homozygous carriers of the T allele having 46% higher chance of developing CRC associated with high red meat intake; this in contrast to homozygous carriers of the reference C allele, that had an 18% higher risk of developing CRC. No statistically significant GXE interactions with processed meat intake were found.<br \/>Conclusion: In this large-scale genome-wide GxE analysis we identified interactions between 4 SNPs and red meat consumption affecting CRC risk. The interaction with the SMAD7 rs35352860 SNP provides supportive evidence for a role of heme iron in the carcinogenic pathway of red meat intake in CRC development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-10 Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Genome-Wide GxE Analysis,Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),Meat Consumption,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Joel Sanchez Mendez<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mariana  C.

African Americans of both sexes have the high incidence rate at 56.8 and the highest death rate at 38.1 per 100,000 people from 2015 to 2019. Non-Hispanic black men have the highest incidence at 73.9 and the highest death rate at 56.3 per 100,000 people. While many genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of lung cancer have discovered ~45 putative risk loci, a large proportion of the heritability of lung cancer remains unexplained. To date, most single population-based GWAS have been performed in Europeans while there are a few Asian ancestry-specific genetic studies and two cross-ancestry studies. Non-European GWAS of lung cancer has been underrepresented. Although African Americans have higher lung cancer incidence and poorer lung cancer survival rate, and smoke fewer cigarettes per day compared to Europeans, few comprehensive GWAS of lung cancer in African Americans has been conducted. This study aims to decipher the genetic component of predisposition to lung cancer among African Americans.

Our GWAS of lung cancer identified five novel genetic susceptibility associations and confirmed several variants on 15q25 and 19q13. Further works are required to elucidate the possible biological mechanisms underlying these associations among lung cancer and histological subtypes in African Americans.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-11 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\/post-GWAS,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Genome-wide association studies (GWAS),,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jinyoung Byun<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Younghun Han<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiangjun Xiao<sup>1<\/sup>, Christine Lusk<sup>2<\/sup>, Hoda  J.

LTL distribution and association studies are essential in providing insights into telomere homeostasis, its relationship with different metabolic traits, and age-related conditions. Such studies have been underperformed in Asian population groups. Here we estimated LTL using whole-genome sequencing data in 8,045 Singaporean samples across three major ethnic groups - Chinese, Indian, and Malay divided into six cohorts: GUSTO, HELIOS, MEC, PRISM, SEED, and TTSH. LTLs were measured using TelSeq, with normalized LTL as phenotype in subsequent analyses. We demonstrated that average LTL was robustly longer in the childhood cohort (GUSTO) compared to the adult cohorts (P&#60;1.19&#215;10<sup>-195<\/sup>). We observed ethnicity differences in LTL where adult Singaporean Chinese samples had the longest LTL (5.08kb) as compared to Malay (4.87kb) and Indian (4.65kb) samples in our datasets (P&#60;4.98&#215;10<sup>-12<\/sup>). Our genetic association analyses replicated multiple variants previously reported to be associated with LTL (binomial P&#60;0.00001) in Asian population groups, providing added confidence in the methodologies used. At the same time, we identified a novel East-Asian-specific novel variant beyond genome-wide association levels (meta P=2.05&#215;10<sup>-08<\/sup>) at the <i>COL28A1\/MIOS<\/i> gene loci to be associated with LTL in our study. Individual analysis of the GUSTO childhood dataset highlighted a second novel genome-wide hit at<i> RAD17<\/i> gene locus to be associated with LTL in our study and indicated that the previously reported variant at the <i>TINF2 <\/i>locus may have significantly opposing effects (compared to adults) during early developmental stages. Gene-level burden analysis for rare variants (MAF &#60;5%) in adult Chinese cohorts revealed potential cancer association with <i>RET<\/i> gene (SKAT, P=5.22&#215;10<sup>-03<\/sup>) and <i>MLH1 <\/i>gene (SKAT, P=0.037), as well as telomere biology condition association with <i>RECQL4 <\/i>gene (CMC, P=0.0399, and VT, P=0.0379). Our findings have broadened the understanding of LTL distribution and the underlying associated genetic characteristics in both childhood and adult Singaporean populations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-11 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\/post-GWAS,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Telomeres,Genome-wide association studies (GWAS),,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Trang Nguyen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Penny Chan<sup>2<\/sup>, Ives Lim<sup>3<\/sup>, Brian Kennedy<sup>4<\/sup>, Neerja Karnani<sup>2<\/sup>, Rajkumar Dorajoo<sup>5<\/sup>, Joanne Ngeow<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Nanyang Technological University Singapore, Singapore, Singapore,<sup>2<\/sup>Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences, Singapore, Singapore,<sup>3<\/sup>Bioinformatics Institute, Singapore, Singapore,<sup>4<\/sup>National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore,<sup>5<\/sup>Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ab9dd2f3-fb6e-4df1-bcee-0a6284f560dc","ControlNumber":"4596","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

A study showed a strong effect modification (<i>P<\/i> for interaction = 0.0002) {Gibbs 2020} by Gc2 (or, vitamin D-binding protein) isoform where patients with the isoform had significantly higher mortality if they had deficient vitamin D levels. However, it is unknown whether this association differs by Gc isoforms in other populations.<br \/>Methods: We examined the association between prediagnostic 25(OH)D levels and overall and CRC-specific mortality among CRC patients within the two ongoing prospective US cohorts: Nurses&#8217; Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We evaluated potential nonlinear association using the restricted cubic splines and assessed effect modification by Gc2 isoform with stratified analyses. Individuals with the Gc rs4588 CC, CA and AA genotypes were classified as having Gc1-1, Gc1-2, and Gc2-2 isoforms, respectively. Participants with a minor allele at Gc rs4588 (rs4588*CA or rs4588*AA genotypes) were defined as having the Gc2 isoform.<br \/>Results: A total of 588 patients were observed until the date of death or last follow-up in 2018, whichever came first. Deficient versus sufficient 25(OH)D concentrations (&#60;30 vs &#8805;50 nmol\/L) were associated with higher overall mortality (HR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.34-3.18) and suggestively with higher CRC-specific mortality (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 0.75-3.07). Spline results showed that the potential beneficial role of vitamin D plateaued around 50 nmol\/L (<i>P<\/i> for nonlinearity = 0.04). The HRs for overall mortality comparing deficient versus sufficient concentrations were 2.43 (95% CI, 1.26-4.70) for patients with Gc1-1 isoform (rs4588 CC) and 1.63 (95% CI, 0.88-3.02) for patients with Gc1-2 or Gc2-2 (rs4588 CA or AA) isoforms (<i>P<\/i> for interaction = 0.54). The HRs for CRC-specific mortality were 1.18 (95% CI, 0.27-5.14) for patients with Gc1-1 isoform and 1.41 (95% CI, 0.62-3.24) for patients with Gc1-2 or Gc2-2 isoforms (<i>P<\/i> for interaction = 0.94).<br \/>Conclusions: We found that lower 25(OH)D levels up to 50 nmol\/L were associated with higher overall mortality, but this association did not differ by Gc isoforms in the two US cohorts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-11 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\/post-GWAS,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vitamin D,Colorectal cancer,Prognosis,Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hanseul Kim<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chen Yuan<sup>2<\/sup>, Long  H.

Despite decades of inquiry into ALL causes, Latino children have up to 1.4 times the rate of ALL compared to their non-Latino White counterparts. The etiology of ALL is complex and this disparity in risk has not been fully explained by social factors alone, suggesting the role of genetic variants and ancestry. Previous literature has implicated variants in <i>IKZF1, ARID5B, GATA3<\/i>,<i> PIP42KA<\/i>, and <i>ERG<\/i> with greater risk allele frequencies or population-specific risk effects in Latinos. Indigenous American ancestry has also been previously associated with ALL risk, relapse, and poor prognosis. To elucidate the genetic and ancestral etiology of ALL, we conducted the first admixture mapping analysis of 1930 childhood ALL cases and 8520 controls of self-identified Latino ethnicity. We uncovered putative admixture associations on chromosomes 2, 7, 10, and 15 (<i>P<\/i> = 3.21 x 10<sup>-5<\/sup> to 7.32 x 10<sup>-8<\/sup> among top associations across the four loci). Two of the four loci, on chromosomes 2 and 15, were previously not known to be associated with ALL. Following imputation with the TOPMed reference panel, we fine-mapped each putative locus by testing the ALL risk association of each variant with a minor allele frequency greater than 1%. The top associated variants at each locus showed substantial frequency differences between ancestries from the gnomAD or 1000Genomes project. For example, the top associated variant on chromosome 2 has a risk allele frequency of 43% in Native Americans from the Human Genome Diversity Panel, but a frequency of 0.10% in Non-Finnish Europeans in gnomAD. Including these variants in the admixture mapping model greatly attenuated the admixture signals at each locus, suggesting that they are likely the causal SNPs or close proxies of the causal SNPs. The top associated variants from three out of the four loci passed regional multiple testing burden and mapped to genes MGAT5, <i>IKFZ1<\/i> and <i>ARID5B<\/i> on chromosomes 2, 7 and 10, respectively. The top two SNPs on chromosome 15, which narrowly missed the regional threshold, mapped to genes RAB11A and MEGF11. We are pursuing replication of putative novel loci on chromosomes 2 and 15 in additional Latino GWAS datasets. Our results suggest that ALL risk variants with higher frequencies in individuals with Native American ancestry may contribute to the observed increased risk of ALL in Latino children. Investigation of such risk loci can contribute to the identification of new target genes for ALL prediction and therapeutics and new insights for precision medicine, which will reduce the burden of ALL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-11 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\/post-GWAS,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Admixture Mapping,Ancestry,Genetic Epidemiology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jalen Langie<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Soyoung Jeon<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaomei Ma<sup>2<\/sup>, Catherine Metayer<sup>3<\/sup>, Adam  J.  de Smith<sup>1<\/sup>, Joseph  L.

Most individuals with LC MBL do not progress to CLL and never come to clinical attention. An active area of research is to identify factors that distinguish those individuals with MBL who progress from those who do not. Currently, 41 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are known to be associated with CLL risk, and a portion of these SNPs have also been found to be associated with MBL risk. We hypothesize that these CLL-susceptibility SNPs associated with both MBL and CLL risk are SNPs associated with developing a B-cell clone; whereas the remaining SNPs found not to be associated with MBL risk are associated with progression of the B-cell clone (i.e., progression from MBL to CLL). To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the association of these 41 SNPs with risk of progression to CLL using a case-control study of 1,911 CLL cases and 1,579 individuals with MBL from Mayo Clinic.<br \/>Individuals with MBL were identified through screening using 8-color flow cytometry assay. Individuals with LC MBL (defined by having a clonal B-cell population with the percent clonal B-cells out of total B-cell count &#60;85%) who had an immunophenotype consistent with CLL were included as controls. CLL cases were obtained through the Mayo Clinic hematology practice. DNA was genotyped from whole blood. We analyzed the 41 CLL susceptibility SNPs with risk of progression to CLL using logistic regression and estimated odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), adjusting for sex and age. We evaluated the CLL polygenic risk score (CLL-PRS), comprised of a weighted average of the 41 SNPs, with risk of CLL.<br \/>Out of the 41 established CLL susceptibility SNPs, 15 were associated with CLL progression from MBL to CLL (all P&#60;0.05). Nine of these 15 significant SNPs were not previously found to be associated with risk of MBL. The most significant SNPs were rs9880772 (OR=1.23, CI: 1.11-1.36, P=6.1x10<sup>-5<\/sup>)<i>,<\/i> rs888096 (OR=1.25, CI: 1.12-1.38, P=3.0x10<sup>-5<\/sup>), and rs305065 (OR=1.28, CI: 1.14-1.43, P=1.5x10<sup>-5<\/sup>)<i>. <\/i>One SNP (rs77551289) had a suggestive association (OR=1.21, P=0.069). The remaining 25 SNPs had no evidence of association with progression (ORs ranging between 0.9-1.1 and all P&#62;0.1). The CLL-PRS was also associated with CLL risk (continuous OR = 1.25, CI: 1.15 - 1.35, P = 6.7 X 10<sup>-8<\/sup>).<br \/>In our study accounting for the presence of B-cell clonal population, we identified 15 out of 41 CLL-susceptibility SNPs to be significantly associated with progression from LC MBL to CLL. The remaining 25 non-significant CLL-SNPs were not associated with progression and may instead be associated with development or initiation of the B-cell clone. These findings suggest that the established CLL susceptibility SNPs may play differing role (i.e., development or progression of the clone) in the etiology of CLL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-11 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\/post-GWAS,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS),Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,Cancer genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Raphael Mwangi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Geffen Kleinstern<sup>2<\/sup>, Sara J.

Tobacco smoking is the main risk factor for BC. Accumulating evidence has found that genetic variants are also associated with the risk of BC. More insights into the biological mechanism of the disease have been gained through candidate gene-environment interaction studies, with the most known examples of the interactions between cigarette smoking and NAT2 and GSTM1 gene variants. Our objective was to perform a genome-wide association case-only study using the French national prospective COBLAnCE cohort (COhort to study BLAdder CancEr), while focusing on three important smoking behavior characteristics.<br \/>Materials and Methods: The COBLAnCE cohort comprises 1,800 BC patients included within 14 centers in France between 2012 and 2018. Peripheral blood samples and complete history of tobacco smoking were collected at enrollment and genotyping was performed using the Illumina Global Screening Array with a Multi-Disease drop-in panel. After the quality control and imputation, 9,719,614 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were investigated. Genotyping data of 1,674 , 1,283 and 1,342 patients were analyzed for smoking status, average tobacco consumption and age at smoking initiation, respectively. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted using logistic (for smoking status) and linear (for age at smoking initiation and average tobacco consumption, both log-transformed) regression models with each of the imputed SNPs as the independent variable adjusting for gender, age and first ten genetic principal components.<br \/>Results: For smoking status, none of the SNPs reached the GWAS significant threshold of 5e-08, but results are suggesting tentative loci at 1p31.3 (rs114073636: OR [95%CI] = 0.31 [0.20-0.47], p = 8.68e-08; rs116571608: OR = 0.31 [0.20-0.47], p = 8.87e-08) and 4q22.1 (rs542541627: OR = 1.69 [1.39-2.06], p = 1.81e-07; rs1533294: OR = 1.63 [1.34-1.98], p = 1.01e-06). Analyses of age at smoking initiation revealed three significant SNPs: rs531756449, rs77186197 and rs78947799 with positive interaction associations (&#946; (SE) = 0.3 (0.05), p = 8.26e-09; &#946; = 0.29 (0.05), p = 3.74e-09; &#946; = 0.31 (0.06), p = 3.97e-08, respectively). Only one SNP at 11q24.1, reached the significant threshold for the average tobacco consumption analyses: rs2714069 (&#946; = 0.63 (0.11), p = 1.35e-08). The locus 16p13.3 seems to have protective variants for the interaction with average tobacco consumption: rs113683380 (&#946; = -0.66 (0.12), p = 6.44e-08) and rs113590624 (&#946; = -0.64 (0.12), p = 2.74e-07).<br \/>Conclusion: Our study suggests new candidate loci interacting with smoking behavior for the risk of BC. Based on a case-only approach, our results need to be validated in a case-control or cohort study. A large-scale meta-analysis GWAS would be needed to identify SNPs with small Minor Allele Frequencies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-11 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\/post-GWAS,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Genome-wide association studies (GWAS),Smoking,Case-only design,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maryam Karimi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sebastian Mendez-Pineda<sup>2<\/sup>, Hélène Blanché<sup>3<\/sup>, Anne Boland<sup>4<\/sup>, Jean-François Deleuze<sup>4<\/sup>, Xiang-Yu Meng<sup>5<\/sup>, Karine Groussard<sup>2<\/sup>, Thierry Lebret<sup>6<\/sup>, Julia Bonastre<sup>1<\/sup>, Yves Allory<sup>7<\/sup>, François Radvanyi<sup>8<\/sup>, Simone Benhamou<sup>2<\/sup>, Stefan Michiels<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Bureau de Biostatistique et d'Epidémiologie (BBE), Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France,<sup>2<\/sup>Oncostat U1018, INSERM, Villejuif, France,<sup>3<\/sup>Biological Resources Center, CEPH-Fondation Jean Dausset, Paris, France,<sup>4<\/sup>Centre National de Recherche en Génomique Humaine, Evry, France,<sup>5<\/sup>Curie Institute, Paris, France,<sup>6<\/sup>Urology, Foch Hospital, Suresnes, France,<sup>7<\/sup>Department of Pathology, Curie Institute, Saint-Cloud, France,<sup>8<\/sup>CNRS UMR444, Curie Institute, Paris, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bad00f0c-7fc9-4f19-8b2b-97699781f8d3","ControlNumber":"4319","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

These studies were based on gene expression prediction models trained mainly in breast tissue, and they did not account for alternative splicing of genes. In this study, we utilized two approaches to perform multi-tissue TWASs of ER- breast cancer: 1) an expression-based TWAS that combined TWAS signals for each gene across multiple tissues and 2) a splicing-based TWAS that combined TWAS signals of all excised introns for each gene across tissues. To perform these two TWASs, we first obtained gene expression prediction models that were trained in 11 tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression including breast, ovary, uterus, vagina, EBV-transformed lymphocytes, whole blood, spleen, liver, subcutaneous adipose, visceral adipose, and cell-cultured fibroblasts. Furthermore, we obtained GWAS summary statistics for ER- breast cancer by performing a meta-analysis of 21,468 ER- cases and 105,974 controls from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium and 9414 BRCA1 mutation carriers who were breast cancer cases and 9494 BRCA1 mutation carriers who did not have breast cancer from the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1 and BRCA2. For our expression-based TWAS, we utilized the Aggregated Cauchy Association Test (ACAT) to collate TWAS signals across all 11 tissues for each gene using equal weights for each tissue, while for our splicing-based TWAS, we utilized ACAT to collate TWAS signals for all excised introns in all tissues for each gene. Overall, we identified 63 genes in 29 loci that were significantly associated with ER- breast cancer, including 23 genes that were identified using both approaches, 27 that were uniquely identified in the expression-based TWAS, and 13 that were uniquely identified in the splicing-based TWAS. Of the 63 genes, 50 genes have not been previously reported in TWAS studies of breast cancer. Using a weighted ACAT method, in which breast tissue was given a 5-fold higher weight, we obtained similar results. In summary, our joint, multi-tissue TWAS corroborated previous GWAS loci for both ER- and overall breast cancer while highlighting how incorporating TWAS signals from multiple tissues and alternative splicing allowed us to discover new susceptibility genes for ER- breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-11 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\/post-GWAS,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Gene expression analysis,Alternative splicing,Genome-wide association studies (GWAS),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>James  L.

Resistance to ICI is likely to reflect a combination of tumor-intrinsic, such as tumor mutational burden, and tumor-extrinsic factors, such as systemic immune suppression and host genetics. With the advent of large-scale germline genotyping studies, there is emerging evidence that host-specific genetic factors can substantially modify both disease risk and responsiveness to therapy. There has been limited characterization to date of the interaction between host genetics and response to ICI. Here, we perform harmonized mutation calling in available normal exome sequencing from 668 metastatic cancer patients treated with ICI (derived from n=7 studies, spanning n=3 cancer types and PD-1\/PD-L1\/CTLA4-directed therapy) and performed exome-wide association studies in European ancestry patients. For each cancer type (melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma), we conducted exome-wide Cox regression (with PC1-4 and sex as covariates) to identify coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with overall survival (OS). On fixed-effect meta-analysis, we identified a single coding variant (rs140221307, C allele, MAF 0.5% in European populations) that met genome-wide significance (p=1.11x10<sup>-15<\/sup>, HR=4.86, 95% CI 3.30-7.15). This SNP causes a substitution of Trp to Arg at amino acid 320 at the interface between the transmembrane and extracellular domains of interleukin 17 receptor A (IL17RA). While the secretion mechanism is uncharacterized, soluble IL17RA can be readily detected in plasma and the survival-reducing variant is associated with substantially elevated plasma IL17RA (p=1.90x10<sup>-9<\/sup>, beta=1.01, Sun et al. 2018) as well as reduced monocyte counts in UK Biobank (p=2.20x10<sup>-308<\/sup>, beta=-0.60). We have established a prime editing strategy to induce this variant in cultured human monocytes to investigate its biochemical and functional consequences, and are performing validation studies in independent patient cohorts. Soluble IL17RA would be expected to function as a decoy receptor to antagonize IL17\/IL17RA signaling, and so these data suggest that activation of IL-17 receptor signaling might improve responsiveness to ICI therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-11 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\/post-GWAS,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Genome-wide association studies (GWAS),Interleukin-17,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sam  O.

Mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) are somatic structural variants that are manifestations of genomic instability and a sign of CH when they occur in blood. The recent availability of large-scale cohorts with blood exome sequence and genotype data has powered genome-wide association studies (GWAS) investigating the germline genetic contribution to CH and mCA risk. However, phenotypes of somatic mutation acquisition in driver genes, clonal selection and expansion, and chromosomal mosaicism are processes that are not confined to blood and contribute to neoplastic transformation across tissue types. GWAS of solid tumor susceptibility have so far identified hundreds of germline variants associated with cancer risk and it is likely that a subset of these variants contributes to solid tumor risk by affecting these somatic phenotypes in the corresponding tissues of origin and that some of the variants exert these somatic effects across tissues. We aimed to identify this subset of solid tumor risk variants by undertaking fixed effects inverse-variance weighted meta-analyses combining breast, prostate, ovarian, and endometrial cancer GWAS (total n = 237,483 cases\/317,006 controls; no UK Biobank samples included) with UK Biobank-based CH (10,203 &#8220;cases&#8221;\/173,918 controls) and mCA (66,011 &#8220;cases&#8221;\/378,188 controls) risk GWAS in pairs where each pair involved one solid tumor type and one of either CH or mCA (for example, breast cancer and mCA constituted a pair).

CCA are classified as intrahepatic and extrahepatic based on anatomical location. CCA are often diagnosed at an advanced stage because there are no effective tools for early detection. Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have discovered many genome-wide significant contributing risk loci, the genetic underpinning of cholangiocarcinoma remains poorly understood. To date, there is no cholangiocarcinoma-specific GWAS. We conducted GWAS of cholangiocarcinoma in 9,648 individuals of European ancestry using TOPMed reference panel. The putative associations in or near THSD7A on chromosome 7 (OR=2.61, P=7.13&#215;10<sup>-8<\/sup>), ZBTB16 on 11 (OR=0.16, P=6.02&#215;10<sup>-8<\/sup>) for non-PSC-related CCA, PUM3 on 9 (OR=10.74, P=6.12&#215;10<sup>-8<\/sup>), AGBL1 on 15 (OR=2.08, P=5.67&#215;10<sup>-8<\/sup>) for PSC-related CCA, and LINC02506 on 4 (OR=0.16, P=8.83&#215;10<sup>-9<\/sup>) for extrahepatic CCA. We also implemented linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSR) analysis to quantify the genetic correlation between phenotypes using publicly available GWAS summary statistics. Our study aimed to identify possible clinical and epidemiological traits associated with CCA. We identified numerous biomarkers, medical conditions, environmental and behavioral traits, and physical measurements showing high heritability, which is the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by all SNPs included in the analysis, and pairwise genetic correlation with CCA and other CCA subtypes. Elevations of selected biomarkers such as alkaline phosphatase, cystatin C, HbA1c, monocyte count, and white blood cell count show a positive genetic association with CCA in European-ancestry population. Also, autoimmune-mediated conditions show a strong positive genetic association with CCA, non-PSC related CCA, and intrahepatic CCA. The GWAS of CCA and CCA subtypes revealed potential genetic susceptibility associations and will allow us to compare the genetic architecture underlying CCA and other diseases of the bile ducts such as primary sclerosing cholangitis and liver cancer. LDSR provided an improved understanding of the genetic architecture between CCA and potential comorbid conditions and biomarkers. Mendelian randomization analysis will be needed to elucidate the causal relationship between CCA and traits of interest.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-11 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\/post-GWAS,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS),Cholangiocarcinoma,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Younghun Han<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Katherine  A.

The higher risk of MM among affected relatives suggests a genetic contribution to the etiology. To date, 24 common risk variants with low effect sizes were identified using genome-wide association studies, which account for 17% of heritability. However, a systematic analysis of the known rare alleles in cancer predisposition genes has not been undertaken so far in MM. We collaborated with six other academic centers across the United States to identify and select cases for analysis of germline predisposition of MM.<br \/>METHODS: We performed whole exome, next-generation sequencing of 2,387 familial or early onset germline MM cases from the myeloma sequencing consortium (MMSEQ). We called 1.5 million variants and performed standard quality control of the data. We also obtained exome data on 1,285 cases from UK Biobank (UKBB) and 344,513 non-cancer controls (total=3,672 cases). We analyzed the ultra-rare, coding variants in 90 clinically relevant or putative candidates for cancer predisposition. We then used the automated variant curator PathoMAN to annotate and assert pathogenicity of each variant. We contrasted our results with assertions of pathogenicity from ClinVar and tested for gene association with MM.<br \/>RESULTS: Overall, we observed several pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, both singleton and recurrent founder mutations. In the MMSEQ, 8.7% of MM cases harbored a pathogenic variant in these known\/putative cancer predisposition genes. Predominant group of pathogenic variants were observed within CHEK2 (19%), TP53 (8%), and ATM (5%). A case-control analysis revealed strong association with TP53 and weakly with ATM. In the familial\/early onset MMSEQ cases, TP53 mutations were enriched 68 times more than in the UKBB controls. Our preliminary results suggest that known genes of cancer susceptibility such as TP53 and ATM may also play a role in myeloma risk.<br \/>CONCLUSION: In a large study of multi-center MM cases, we identified a significant proportion of individuals who are carriers of known (solid) cancer predisposition genes. This study suggests that these known cancer predisposition genes may be relevant in a subset of MM cases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-15 Next-generation sequencing in epidemiology studies (whole genome, exome, targeted, or fine-mapping),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,TP53,Whole exome sequencing,ATM,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Michael  T.

Although germline mutation of APC promoter 1B was reported as a pathogenic variant in 2016, there are still many unknowns about the carcinogenesis. In this study, we performed a comprehensive Next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of GAPPS clinical specimens to investigate the molecular profile characteristic of carcinogenesis.<br \/>Patients and Methods: Seven cases from three GAPPS families experienced in our department were included in this study. In each case, tissues were collected from normal mucosa, polyps, and carcinoma,<br \/>and FFPE and fresh-frozen samples were prepared. After pathological diagnosis was performed on each sample, RNA and DNA were extracted and analyzed based on data obtained by next generation sequence (NGS).<br \/>Results: In the RNA sequence, gene expression analysis was performed on 45 pathologically diagnosed samples, which were classified into four clusters by K-means clustering. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of the four clusters showed that cancer-related genes such as p53 and KRAS were significantly enriched in the cluster of cancer, and genes related to immune response were significantly enriched in the cluster of cancer compared to the and clusters of polyp and normal. Gene mutation analysis using whole-exome sequence (read depth\/coverage&#62;20) confirmed mutation of APC promoter 1B in all samples. On the other hand, in tumor samples (N=10), the percentage of mutation of genes previously suggested to be associated with GAPPS (TP53, FBXW7, GNAS, and KRAS) were 50%, 0%, 30%, and 60%, respectively.<br \/>Conclusion: Comprehensive gene expression analysis by RNA sequence and whole-exome sequence was performed using clinical samples of GAPPS.

The Polyethnic-1000 (P1000) is a multi-institutional WGS initiative together with the New York Genome Center, investigating cancers having a higher prevalence in AA populations. We are extending on the P1000 in MM precursor disease; prospectively defining genomic, immune and microbiome factors driving progression, focused on the impact of racial origin.<br \/>Hypothesis: Self-described race, according to proscribed categories, is insufficient to delineate biological contribution to MM development. We propose that unique biological insights first require a comprehensive definition of genetic origin, considering heterogeneity within historical groups.<br \/>Methods: For collaborative large-scale analysis, we&#8217;ve developed a comprehensive cross-institutional bioinformatic pipeline (https:\/\/github.com\/pblaney\/mgp1000). We&#8217;ve included admixture; a composition profile based on SNPs with genotypes corresponding to reference samples from 23 geographic populations. AA is divided into 5 populations (Esan, Luhya, Mende, Gambian and Yoruba), and 3 American populations are defined (Peruvian, Columbian and Puerto Rican). WGS was performed on blood mononuclear cells from 44 patients with MM or precursor disease, 29 self-identified as AA and 18 as Hispanic.<br \/>Results: Estimating directly from WGS data, complexity hidden by self-reported race was revealed by genetically determined admixture. Filtering to &#8805;1%, 43\/44 patients had contribution from &#62;1 of the 23 reference populations. Patients varied widely in their genetic diversity; 3 had &#8805;90% from a single population, 21 had &#8805;25% from at least 2 populations (consistent with grandparents) and 37 had &#8805;12.5% from different populations (consistent with great-grandparents). Within those 37, 18 patients had contributing populations within the same superfamily (i.e., all African), while 19 were across superfamily&#8217;s (i.e., African + East Asian). Hierarchical clustering produced 5 main clusters, with samples in 2 clusters having predominantly Esan and Mende contribution, while differing in contribution from other AA \/ non-AA populations. All samples in one cluster contained American contribution &#62;60%, another had predominantly European and American contribution, and the final cluster had AA &#60;10%, and heterogenous population contributions.<br \/>Conclusion: Self-reported race does not consider the significant variability of genetic admixture demonstrated by this analysis, and likely has insufficient granularity regarding inherited risk. Ongoing studies will incorporate genetic admixture alongside somatic genomic assessment to accurately investigate progression risk from precursor disease to MM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-15 Next-generation sequencing in epidemiology studies (whole genome, exome, targeted, or fine-mapping),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Genomics,African American,Hispanic,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kylee  H.

It accounts for 12% and 8% of all estimated new cases of cancer and 11% and 9% of all cancer deaths in Hispanic men and women, respectively. Long-term cumulative exposure to environmental factors such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been implicated to cause molecular damage and DNA modifications that are critical for CRC pathogenesis through stress-survival pathway genes. However, limited number of studies related to the role of these pathways have not been conducted for the Hispanic population. The identification and validation of new ethnicity-specific transcriptomic markers within the stress-survival pathways is important for improving treatment, prognosis, and detection strategies. In this study, we have explored the role of stress-survival pathway genes in Hispanic and Non-Hispanic White (NHW) CRC tissues. In one of the previously published studies from our lab we used microarray and RNA-seq datasets obtained from the gene expression omnibus (GEO), the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), and the oncomine databases to identify 28 genes associated with CRC. These genes were screened for transcript level expressions in six CRC cell lines and a normal colon cell line, and in cDNA arrays containing the tumor (n=40) from different CRC stages, and control (n=8) samples by qRT-PCR. The protein level expressions were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in CRC tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing different stages of tumor (n = 108) and control (n = 12) tissues. All 28 genes were also analyzed for their transcript-level expressions in Hispanic (n=10) and NHW (n=10) tumors and corresponding non-tumor adjacent (NATs; n=3) tissues. The stress-survival pathway genes associated with cell cycle regulation such as <i>CHEK1, MCM10, PDCD2L, CCNB1, CDK1 <\/i>and<i> CDK4<\/i>, and an oxidative stress marker <i>PRDX4<\/i> were upregulated at both transcript and protein levels when compared to its normal counterparts. Additionally, the genes <i>CHEK1<\/i>, <i>MCM10,<\/i> <i>BCL2L1, CSE1L, ESPL1, GLA, GPX2, RRM2B, SH3GLB1, TNFRSF12A, TRAF5 and TRIB3<\/i> were observed to be upregulated whereas <i>GPX1, NOXA, NQO1, SLC7A11, BCL2L12, CCNB1, CDK1, CDK4, FOXM1, PDCD2L <\/i>and<i> SOD2<\/i> were found to be downregulated in Hispanic tumor tissues when compared to NHWs. Only <i>CDK1, CHEK1, FOXM1<\/i> and <i>NQO1 <\/i>were seen to be differentially expressed in the Hispanic and NHW NATs; however, their expression patterns were different from that observed in the respective tumor tissues. Overall, our current findings evaluate the expression of stress-survival pathway genes across different CRC cell lines, stages, and Hispanic and NHW tissues. The genes identified to be differentially expressed in Hispanic tissues may be used as potential biomarkers or as therapeutic targets specific to the Hispanic population in future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-16 Pathway and candidate gene studies of risk or prognosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Hispanic,Stress-survival pathway genes,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Urbashi Basnet<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Aditi Kulkarni<sup>1<\/sup>, Frances A.

Genome-wide association studies have identified common variants associated with risk of specific lymphoma subtypes, but less is known about the contribution of rare inherited variants in the genetic architecture of lymphoma risk. <i>CHEK2<\/i> is important to DNA repair and 2 small studies have found evidence of an association between <i>CHEK2<\/i> variants and risk of lymphoma. Here, we investigated loss of function (LoF) variants in <i>CHEK2<\/i> with risk of lymphoma (overall and subtypes). The study population included newly diagnosed lymphoma cases from Mayo who were enrolled in the Lymphoma SPORE Molecular Epidemiology Resource (MER). Controls were from the Mayo Clinic Biobank, from which we excluded a prior hematologic malignancy. Whole exome sequencing was performed by Regeneron on an Illumina NovaSeq panel (mean coverage of 48X). Variants were called using GATK v4 and variant annotation was performed using BioR. All LoF variants (nonsense, frameshift and consensus splice sites) in <i>CHEK2<\/i> with a minor allele frequency &#60; 0.5% were included in the analyses. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between <i>CHEK2<\/i>mutation status and risk of lymphoma overall, and by lymphoma subtypes that had more than 5 mutation carriers, which included diffuse large B-cell (DLBCL), follicular (FL), and T-cell lymphoma (TCL). All analyses were adjusted for age (at diagnosis for cases and at enrollment for controls) and sex. A total of 4,852 lymphoma cases and 49,724 controls were included in this analysis. Median age for both cases and controls was 62 years (range 18-99 years). Males accounted for 57.5% (n=2,789) of the cases and 40.6% (n=20,186) of the controls. The DLBCL (23.6% of cases) and FL (23.3% of cases) subtypes were the most common; 7.6% of cases had TCL. A total of 407 (0.7%) individuals had a LoF variant. The frequency of LoF variants was 1.2% in lymphoma cases and 0.7% in controls. LoF variants were associated with increased risk of lymphoma overall (OR=1.77; 95%CI: 1.32-2.33), DLBCL (OR=2.07; 95%CI: 1.20-3.13), and TCL (OR=2.78; 95%CI: 1.178-5.50), but not FL (OR=1.31; 95%CI: 0.65-2.34). CHEK2 c.1100delC was the most frequently mutated variant in this population, accounting for 76% of all LoF variants. Individuals with a c.1100delC variant had an increased risk of lymphoma overall (OR=1.90; 95%CI: 1.37-2.58), DLBCL (OR=2.06; 95%CI: 1.09-3.54), and TCL (OR=3.17; 95%CI:1.24-6.58), but not FL (OR=1.05; 95%CI: 0.41-2.15). When restricted to cases, there was no significant difference in age at diagnosis (P=0.62) or sex (P=0.53) between LoF variant carriers and non-carriers. In this large lymphoma case-control study, <i>CHEK2<\/i> LoF variants were associated with increased risk of lymphoma, demonstrating that rare inherited variants may play an important role in the etiology of lymphoma. Additional work is needed to investigate missense variants in <i>CHEK2<\/i> and risk of lymphoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-16 Pathway and candidate gene studies of risk or prognosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma,Risk factors,Genetic susceptibility,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nicholas  J.

To comprehensively understand genetic basis of immune system underlying CRC progression, association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and polygenic risk scores (PRS) of immune-related genes were investigated with colorectal cancer survival.<br \/>Methods: CRC patients enrolled in the Seoul National University Hospital with prospective follow-up were included in the study. From blood-derived DNA from CRC patients, genome-wide SNPs were genotyped by using the Korea Biobank Array (KoreanChip). 2,729 immune-related genes were selected from Ensembl, Gene Ontology (GO), and KEGG database and 37,398 mapped SNPs were extracted. SNP or PRS-based Cox proportional hazard models were fit for events of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) estimating effect sizes with hazard ratios (HRs). PRS was calculated as effect size weighted sum of risk alleles of individual patients and categorized into tertiles. To investigate enriched pathways, protein-protein interaction networks analysis was conducted. Bonferroni-corrected <i>p<\/i>-value (1.3&#215;10<sup>-6<\/sup>) was used as statistically significance threshold.<br \/>Results: Among 960 CRC patients, 154 (16.0%) occurred events of death and 245 (25.5%) of progression during the follow-up (median=1,698 days, range=7-2,563 days). For OS, a statistically significant associations were mapped to <i>ACTR3B<\/i> , <i>ST6GAL1<\/i>, <i>COTL1<\/i>, <i>PRKCZ<\/i>, and <i>CAMK1D<\/i> genes with the strongest SNP rs14808985 (HR=3.07, P=1.87&#215;10<sup>-7<\/sup>). For PFS, marginal association was mapped to <i>MECOM<\/i> gene with the strongest SNP rs16854234 (HR=1.48, <i>P<\/i>=6.13&#215;10<sup>-6<\/sup>). In PRS analysis, the highest tertile group showed the prominently increased risk for OS (HR=25.0, <i>P<\/i>&#60;2.0&#215;10<sup>-16<\/sup> ) and PFS (HR=5.88, <i>P<\/i>&#60;2.0&#215;10<sup>-16<\/sup> ) compared with the lowest group for a reference. In protein-protein interaction networks analysis, the strongest enrichments were shown in Th17 cell differentiation pathway for OS and in adherences junction for PFS.<br \/>Conclusions: We identified novel predictive biomarker genetic variants in <i>ACTR3B<\/i> and <i>MECOM<\/i> genes associated with OS and PFS, respectively, among CRC patients. Additionally, we presented PRS as a useful biomarker for survival outcomes and suggested enriched biological pathways involved in CRC progression. These knowledges can promote the understanding of CRC survival and the development of immune-related therapeutic interventions for CRC patients in the future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-16 Pathway and candidate gene studies of risk or prognosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),Protein-protein interactions,Survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dabin Yun<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nan Song<sup>1<\/sup>, Jin-Ah Sim<sup>2<\/sup>, Min Jung Kim<sup>3<\/sup>, Ji Won Park<sup>3<\/sup>, Seung Yong Jeong<sup>3<\/sup>, Aesun Shin<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>School of Pharmacy, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>School of AI Convergence, Hallym University, Chuncheon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Surgery, Seoul National University College of Medicine and Hospital, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Preventive Medicine, Seoul National University College  of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b251a51b-3aa7-4765-97b8-d9ec708ce072","ControlNumber":"1553","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

Since large-scale genetic studies of human disease are predominately focused on populations of European ancestry, little is known about breast cancer molecular biology in Hispanic\/Latinos which can widen cancer health disparities due to suboptimal translation of discoveries into clinical practice or public health policy. We aim to describe relevant pathways in breast cancer subtype differentiation in breast cancer patients from Peru.<br \/><b>Patients and Methods:<\/b> Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissues samples were whole exome sequenced for a total of 271 patients, recruited by the Peruvian Breast Cancer Genomics Study (PEGEN-BC) from the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neopl&#225;sicas (INEN) in Lima, Peru. Quality control was conducted to remove genes with low counts. Intrinsic tumor subtypes were classified using the PAM50 method using genefu package in R. Differential gene expression between subtypes was performed by DEseq2 R package and statistical significance was determined using FDR&#60;0.05 for samples with at least log2 1.5-fold change. Pathway analyses were performed to explore differences among the subtypes using GSEA with fgsea package in R. Indigenous American ancestry proportions for participants were estimated using germline genome-wide genotypes and the program Admixture.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: The mean age of patients was 50 and the median Indigenous American ancestry was 79%. PAM50 classification of the sequenced samples defined 20.2% of tumors as LumA, 27.9% as LumB, 27.1% as HER2, 22.5% as Basal and 2.3% as Normal. Transcriptomic pathway analysis showed that most of the significantly changed pathways were similar to those previously described such as upregulation of high proliferation pathways in LumB, HER2E and Basal tumors, and a strong dependency on the estrogen pathway for LumA. Top 10 significantly changed pathways show some unique findings: the epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) pathway is downregulated in Basal, comparing to LumA and HER2 tumors, which is unexpected given that the EMT is associated with stem cell features and poor outcomes. The E2F-targets pathway is upregulated in LumA when comparing to HER2 tumors, but downregulated when compared to Basal tumors.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: We identified novel pathways associated with breast cancer subtypes in individuals with high Indigenous American ancestry from Peru and are working on testing the robustness of these findings. If our findings are confirmed, results would suggest a more aggressive profile of Luminal subtypes in the studied samples from Peru, with implications for treatment and survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-16 Pathway and candidate gene studies of risk or prognosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pathway,RNA sequencing,Breast cancer,Intrinsic Subtypes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chenghuiyun Xu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Valentina  A.

LS is caused by germline mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes, <i>MLH1, MSH2, MSH6<\/i>, and <i>PMS2<\/i>. Identification of these mutations is important in LS diagnosis in order to guide treatment plans and preventative care for patients&#8217; and their families. However, the consequences of some variants in these genes are not immediately obvious, granting them classification as variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Half of known variants in the MMR gene <i>MSH6<\/i> are VUS and, thus, the goal of my project is to provide evidence to help better determine their pathogenic significance. Laboratory functional analysis to determine whether these variants disrupt MMR function in human cells can provide such evidence toward this goal. We have previously used CRISPR gene editing to recreate variants in the endogenous loci for the MMR genes <i>MSH2<\/i> and <i>MLH1<\/i> in human embryonic stem cells (hESC) in order to test their effects on MMR function in a cellular environment. We will now use test whether this approach can be used to study <i>MSH6<\/i> VUS. Using these edited hESC lines we are examining the impact of the variants on RNA and protein stability, repair of DNA microsatellites, which is a hallmark of normal MMR function, and induction of the MMR-dependent DNA damage response. Using a panel of known <i>MSH6<\/i> pathogenic and benign controls, we will calibrate these functional assays in order to associate functional performance with likelihood of pathogenicity. We will next test a separate panel of known controls to validate these assays. Finally, we will examine up to 35 VUS. With this compilation of data, we will convert the results into a quantitative Odds of Pathogenicity value. This Odds of Pathogenicity score can be used by expert variant interpretation committees to help readily reclassify these variants, and provide a clearer diagnosis for these suspected Lynch syndrome patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-09 Functional studies of genetic variants,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mismatch repair,Lynch syndrome,Assay development,Stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Elizabeth Szabo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Emily Blackburn<sup>1<\/sup>, Patrick Pagano<sup>2<\/sup>, Abhijit Rath<sup>1<\/sup>, Christopher Heinen<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f31d9533-d3f6-4787-8f74-383a5a967540","ControlNumber":"3249","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>E.

The underrepresentation of Latin American populations in public databases has hindered the study of the mechanisms by which this SNP confers a protective effect. We aimed to identify IA germline variants associated with BC risk and to test their association with tumor gene expression in this region.<br \/>We performed a case-control fine-mapping analysis in the 6q25 region. BC patients part of the PEGEN-BC Study (N=1809) were included as cases and women from a pregnancy outcomes study in Peru as controls (N=3334). Genome-wide genotype data were available and missing genotypes were imputed using the TOPMED Imputation Server. Logistic regression was used to test the association between each SNP and BC risk. We exome-sequenced 247 breast tumors of PEGEN-BC patients. Tumor subtype was assigned by the pam50 method. We excluded patients diagnosed with stage IV disease, with tumors classified as normal-like or as uncertain, and carriers of the GG genotype for rs140068132, leaving 242 samples. Association between rs140068132 and gene expression of genes in the 6q25 region was tested adjusting by age at diagnosis and IA ancestry.<br \/>The strongest signal corresponded to rs140068132 (odds ratio (OR)=0.53, p=1.9e-21). The model adjusted by rs140068132 revealed three additional independent variants that correlate with Indigenous American ancestry: rs184135739 (OR=0.8, p=0.006), rs141057867 (OR=0.87, p=0.006) and rs140125124 (OR=1.23, p=0.015). Gene expression analysis stratified by subtype revealed that among HER2+ tumors (N=63), rs140068132 was associated with ARMT1 (fold change comparing AA to AG (FC)=1.6, p&#60;0.01), CCDC170 (FC=1.8, p&#60;0.01), MTHFD1L (FC=0.7, p&#60;0.01) and RMND1 (FC=1.4, p=0.013). Among Luminal-B (N=68) tumors, there was an association with ARMT1 (FC= 1.9, p=0.001), ESR1 (FC=1.4, p=0.04) and MTHFD1L (FC= 0.8, p=0.02). Only ESR1 was associated with the SNP (FC= 0.5, p= 0.03) among basal tumors (N=56). No association was identified among Luminal-A tumors (N=55). rs141057867 showed evidence of cis-association with CLDN20 (FC=1.4, p=0.014) among HER2+ subtypes and rs184135739 with ZC3H12D (FC=2.1, p=0.02) and SUMO4 (FC=1.8, p=0.023) among Lumina-A tumors.<br \/>Two of the three novel IA SNPs are protective against BC and show association with gene expression. The rs140068132-G variant regulates the expression of genes in the 6q25 region in a subtype-specific manner. A possible mechanism explaining the protective effect of the rs140068132 polymorphism might be linked to the lower expression of MTHFD1L among G-allele carriers in some subtypes. This gene is deregulated in cancer and its expression is negatively associated with cancer survival, including BC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-09 Functional studies of genetic variants,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Genetic polymorphism,Hispanic,Gene expression analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Valentina  A.

For the remaining cases, BC develops as a result of the complex interaction between environmental and lifestyle risk factors as well as inherited familial predisposition. While low penetrance genetic variants have limited impact on BC risk when taken individually, their combined effect on polygenic risk scores may provide a risk elevated enough to justify clinical actions. Most of the previous work in hereditary breast cancer research has focused on variants located in the coding region of the genes and as a result, there is an abundance of information on the functional interpretation of such variants, while information on regulatory variants remains limited. The goal of this study was to assess the functional impact of germline variants in the promoter region of BC susceptibility genes on gene expression level. Genes evaluated include <i>CDH1<\/i>, <i>STK11<\/i>, and bidirectional promoter genes <i>ATM<\/i>\/<i>NPAT<\/i> and <i>PALB2<\/i>\/<i>DCTN5<\/i>. A bioinformatics approach was developed to identify and prioritize variants based on conservation level and predicted binding of transcription regulatory proteins. Selected variants will be introduced into pGL3 constructs harboring the promoter of interest using site-directed mutagenesis followed by transfection into HEK293T cells. Dual-glo luciferase expression assays are used to measure levels of promoter activities. Expression levels from promoters containing genetic variants are compared with those from constructs containing the reference sequence. The reference constructs for <i>STK11<\/i> and <i>CDH1 <\/i>containing the genes complete promoters demonstrated functional activity. For bidirectional promoters, forwards and reverse construct were tested. Forward <i>ATM<\/i>\/<i>NPAT and PALB2<\/i>\/<i>DCTN5 <\/i>constructs<i> <\/i>showed luciferase expression under the influence of ATM and <i>DCTN5 <\/i>respectively. Work is on the way to assess promoter activity of the reverse complement sequence of those promoters and determine the impact of 13 candidate variants on the strength of these promoters. At the clinical level, identifying germline variants that contribute to BC risk could help better define BC risk in women with negative hereditary cancer genetic test results.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-09 Functional studies of genetic variants,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Promoter,SNP,Gene expression,Genetic susceptibility,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nelly Arlene Arroyo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lenin  J.

The 3D chromatin organization brings enhancers in spatial proximity with a promoter to regulate target gene expression. Therefore, to map chromatin interactions between GWAS variants and target gene promoters we performed region-focused chromatin conformation capture assay (Capture-C) in primary human melanocytes. We baited the entire region of association for all 68 independent signals from the recent melanoma GWAS, and Capture-C interactions were called using CHiCAGO tool. Integrative analysis of Capture-C interactions with melanocyte- and melanoma-specific ATAC-sequencing, massive-parallel reporter assay (MPRA), ROADMAP chromatin imputed state model, and gene expression datasets helped prioritize target genes for functional follow-up.<br \/>Capture-C assays identified physical chromatin interactions between fine-mapped risk variants and candidate causal gene (CCG) promoters at 90% of the GWAS loci; For 84% of the 68 loci, we observed at least one variant-to-gene promoter interaction longer than 100 kb, and for 20% of loci we found interactions beyond 1 Mb. For 76% of the 68 loci, the CCG-interacting variant was in annotated melanocyte or melanoma enhancer regions consistent with CCG regulation via an enhancer-promoter interaction. We observed at least one CCG-interacting variant in 63% and 51% of the 68 loci with distinct allele specific transcriptional activity in melanocyte and melanoma MPRA datasets respectively. A majority of the loci (60%) harbored CCG-linked risk variants in accessible chromatin regions in melanocytes and melanoma. Pathway enrichment analyses of Capture-C-nominated CCGs identified embryonic development, aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling, and DNA repair pathways. Notably, we observed chromatin interactions between risk variants located near the 3&#8217; of Rap Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor 1 (<i>RAPGEF1<\/i>) to the <i>RAPGEF1<\/i><i> <\/i>and<i> UCK1 <\/i>promoter regions. The risk allele of the lead variant (rs3780269) at this locus was associated with higher <i>RAPGEF1<\/i> mRNA expression and was not associated with <i>UCK1<\/i> expression in melanocytes. We performed a CRISPR knockout proliferation screen in immortalized melanocytes and identified <i>RAPGEF1<\/i> as an essential gene for melanocyte growth or survival. Further, we validated the results of this screen by overexpressing <i>RAPGEF1<\/i> in immortalized melanocytes and found that it leads to increased cellular growth. We are now characterizing its function in melanoma tumor incidence and progression in a zebrafish model. In summary, mapping GWAS loci chromatin interactions to target gene promoters and integrative analysis using cell-type specific datasets identified <i>RAPGEF1<\/i> as a melanoma susceptibility gene.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-09 Functional studies of genetic variants,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genetic susceptibility,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Genomics,Gene regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Rohit Thakur<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mai Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Alexandra Thornock<sup>2<\/sup>, Hayley Sowards<sup>1<\/sup>, Epring Long<sup>1<\/sup>, Thomas Rheling<sup>1<\/sup>, Karen Funderburk<sup>1<\/sup>, Jinhu Yin<sup>1<\/sup>, Rebecca Hennessey<sup>1<\/sup>, Raj Chari<sup>3<\/sup>, Tongwu Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Lea Jessop<sup>1<\/sup>, Timothy Myers<sup>1<\/sup>, Matthew  E.

Accurate penetrance estimates are important for cancer screening and diagnosis, and for policy making in public health. We developed two Bayesian semi-parametric models: a model that estimates cancer-specific penetrances to the first primary (CS), and a model that estimates penetrances to the second primary without distinguishing between the cancer types (MPC). Model training requires a dataset that is enriched with enough MPC cases, as well as with competing risks from a variety of cancer types. Thus, we trained our models using data from families affected by the Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS), a genetic disorder characterized by germline mutation in the gene<i> TP53<\/i>. This dataset consists of 189 families, all of which were ascertained via probands who were diagnosed with pediatric sarcoma at MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) between 1944 and 1983. We have validated our penetrance estimates on independent LFS datasets with different ascertainment criteria, namely a patient cohort prospectively collected from high-risk clinics at MDACC, and another cohort from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). These datasets were meticulously collected for research purposes. However, clinical datasets, which resemble the data that genetic counselors encounter in counseling sessions, are severely impacted by missing data, most commonly missing ages at diagnosis and ages at last contact, and only represent a snapshot of family history without extended follow-up. To investigate the utility of our research-based risk prediction models in real-world clinics, we evaluated our penetrance estimates on clinically ascertained LFS families that were collected through the Clinical Cancer Genetics (CCG) program at MDACC in the past 10 years. The CCG dataset consists of 3,275 individuals across 124 families, of which 645 were diagnosed with at least one primary and 127 tested positive for <i>TP53<\/i> mutation. Our CS model showed good performance when making cancer-specific predictions of the first primary, with Areas Under the Curve (AUCs) of 0.76, 0.81, and 0.68 for breast cancer, sarcoma, and all other cancer types combined. Our MPC model showed an AUC of 0.7 when predicting patients with MPC versus those with a single primary. Both the CS and MPC models perform better than the Chompret criteria when predicting <i>TP53 <\/i>mutation, with AUCs of 0.75 and 0.77 respectively. These results suggest that our models can be utilized for personalized risk predictions in clinical settings, despite being trained on a research-based dataset. Given that the Chompret criteria tends to predict <i>TP53 <\/i>mutation more conservatively, the ability of our models to cast a wider net is especially meaningful in the identification of potential carriers, which assists efficient genetic testing and screening.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-21 Risk prediction models for incidence, prognosis, and\/or mortality,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer risk,Personalized risk prediction,TP53,Genetic counseling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Nam  H.

Most biopsies lead to a diagnosis of benign breast disease (BBD) and these women have a 1.5- to fourfold increase in subsequent breast cancer (BC) risk compared with the general population. A polygenic risk score (PRS) including 313 common variants was developed to predict BC risk in the general population and has improved performance when added to existing BC prediction models. However, the value of PRS in risk prediction models among women with BBD has not been evaluated.<br \/>To evaluate the role of the established PRS, BBD, and BC risk, we<b> <\/b>pooled data from 15,194 white women (6,706 BC cases and 8,488 controls) participating in five Breast Cancer Association Consortium case-control studies. BC risk associations were evaluated by self-reported BBD history and combinations of PRS<sub> <\/sub>expressed in tertiles using odds ratios (OR), considering the lowest category of PRS among women without BBD as the referent. Associations were also assessed in an independent case-cohort study (831 BC cases and 1,845 controls) using hazard ratios (HR).<br \/>Among the case-control studies, the PRS was strongly associated with BC risk (OR=2.50 per standard deviation increase), and associations were similar in women with (OR=2.60) and without a history of BBD (OR=2.44, p-interaction=0.23). Women with BBD have a higher risk of BC than those without BBD within each level of PRS. Compared to women without BBD and in the lowest PRS category, those with BBD and PRS in the highest tertile had 5-fold increased odds of BC (OR = 5.38; 95% CI 4.73-6.13). Associations were similar in an independent case-cohort study.<br \/>These findings indicate that BBD history and PRS are independent contributors to BC risk, and consideration of both simultaneously could improve breast cancer risk prediction. Future studies are needed to integrate PRS with other risk measures to refine absolute BC risk prediction among BBD patients.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{95814DB5-B8F2-4391-9979-97D34816A83B}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"8\">Associations of BC risk with combinations of PRS (tertiles) and history of BBD in five case-control studies and a case-cohort study from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\">Case-control studies<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\">Case-cohort study<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PRS score range<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">History of BBD<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">n BC cases<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">n controls<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">OR (95% CI)<sup>1<\/sup><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">n BC cases<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">n controls<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">HR (95% CI)<sup>2<\/sup><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Tertile 1 (&#8804; -0.57)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">No<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1009<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2692<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.00 (Ref)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">117<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">584<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.00 (Ref)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Yes<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">508<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">902<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.54 (1.35-1.76)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">69<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">163<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2.05 (1.45-2.89)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Tertile 2 (-0.58, -0.03)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">No<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1469<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2001<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.97 (1.78-2.17)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">181<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">475<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1.93 (1.48-2.51)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Yes<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">760<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">798<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2.65 (2.34-3.01)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">108<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">170<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2.99 (2.18-4.09)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Tertile 3 (&#8805; -0.02)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">No<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1910<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1551<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3.32 (3.01-3.67)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">214<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">336<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3.28 (2.52-4.26)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Yes<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1050<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">544<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5.38 (4.73-6.13)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">142<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">117<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4.83 4.25-8.02)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"8\">1.Logistic regression analysis, adjusted for study site\/genomic platform and age at enrollment.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) represent a summation of an individual&#8217;s risk associated alleles across their genome but it is unclear whether PRS improve prognostic assessments beyond available clinical data.<br \/>Specific Aims: To evaluate the characteristics of studies examining PRS discrimination for PDAC before and after accounting for clinical factors.<br \/>Methods: Following the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews (DOI: osf.io\/97hxw), we performed a comprehensive literature search in conjunction with a professional librarian to identify preprint and published research studies evaluating PDAC PRS.<br \/>Results: Nineteen studies (of 392 reviewed citations) examined associations between a PDAC-specific PRS and PDAC. The majority were conducted among the UK Biobank (n= 8) and pancreatic cancer consortia (n=4). The rest were institutional biobanks or hospital-based studies. Thirteen studies used a case-control design, and 7 adjusted for clinical risk factors (Table). Only 3 studies (15.8%) evaluated the change in discrimination with the addition of PRS to clinical factors vs. clinical factors alone, and 2 of these reported small but statistically significant improvements in discrimination (&#916;AUC: 0.030, 0.039). Source populations were younger\/healthier (n=9) than those at risk for PDAC, exclusively European (n=14), or drew controls without relevant exposures such as pancreatic diseases (n=2).<br \/>Conclusions: Most PDAC-specific PRS studies do not account for well-established clinical factors or evaluate changes in discrimination with the addition of PRS to clinical factors. Of the 3 studies that did, only 2 showed a modest improvement in discrimination. For PRS to be clinically useful, they must demonstrate more substantial improvements in discrimination beyond established risk factors.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{962E1351-EAF4-46BA-A3E5-09109749567E}\"><caption>Studies containing PDAC-specific polygenic risk scores and clinical risk factors<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">First Author<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Journal<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Year<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Study Design<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Aim\/Purpose<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Population Description<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Population Size<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Ancestry<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Definition of Pancreatic Cancer<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Deriving the Polygenic Risk score<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Analysis<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Clinical risk Factors<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Evalulation of predictive ability of models containing PRS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Evaluation of the Additive Benefit of PRS<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Clinical Context<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Byrne<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">medRxiv<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2021<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">cohort<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">evaluate the effect of lifestyle and genetic risk on overall cancer risk for 13 separate cancers<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">UK Biobank<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">195,822 total individuals (451 cancers)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">European genetic ancestry<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ICD codes, cancer registries<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">22 SNPs used for pancreatic cancer<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Cox proportional hazards regression<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Townsend Index (socioeconomic index), education, birth location, income, height<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">no<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">no<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">national cohort of individuals in the UK, notably younger and of European ancestry<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Galeotti<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">BMJ<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2021<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">case\/control<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">test association of pancreatic cancer specific PRS, with addition of ABO SNPs, smoking, and diabetes<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PANcreaticDisease ReseArch (PANDoRA) consortium: controls were without any pancreatic diseases<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9409 total individuals (3619 cases, 5790 controls)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">European genetic ancestry<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">confirmed diagnosis of pancreatic cancer<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">SNPs at GWAS significance or near significance (p&lt;10<sup>&#8722;7<\/sup>);

However, the causal variants and mechanisms at these loci remain unknown. We performed statistical fine mapping and functional enrichment to identify credible causal variants at 31 established BCC risk loci.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We performed statistical fine mapping by applying the sum of single effects (SuSiE) method to a previously published GWAS from 12,945 BCC cases and 274,252 controls. To identify genomic annotations enriched for BCC-associated variants, we compared high Posterior Inclusion Probability (PIP) variants from SuSIE to low PIP variants: we performed multivariable logistic regression of high-PIP status on 17 variant annotations from the Functional Annotation of Variants Online Resources (FAVOR) database, including sequence-contextual and functional annotations.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We identified 6 variants with PIP&#62;0.99: rs1126809 (<i>TYR<\/i>), rs1805007 (<i>MC1R<\/i>), rs78378222 (<i>TP53<\/i>), rs12203592 (<i>IRF4<\/i>), rs35407(<i>SLC45A2<\/i> a.k.a. <i>MATP<\/i>), rs12916300 (<i>HERC2<\/i>). Five of these six variants are in pigmentation genes; the sixth is in the tumor suppressor <i>TP53<\/i>. At a seventh region, the 95% credible set contained two variants in or upstream of <i>RALY<\/i>, which has previously been shown to be associated with pigmentation traits and multiple non-skin cancers. Another four regions had fewer than 10 variants in the credible set; the median size of the credible set was 11 (range: 1-76).<b><\/b> After adjusting for sequence context (including location relative to exons, introns, UTRs; GC content; local mutation density, and nucleotide diversity) variants in active chromatin regions (as determined from multi-tissue methylation marks), variants in transcription factor binding sites, and skin eQTLs were significantly more likely to be high-PIP variants.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Our results identify candidate variants, genes, and mechanisms for further study in BCC carcinogenesis.<br \/><b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-09 Functional studies of genetic variants,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS),Basal Cell\/Skin cancer,Functional annotation,Fine mapping,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mingyue Li<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Constance Turman<sup>2<\/sup>, Peter Kraft<sup>3<\/sup>, Jiali Han<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Epidemiology, Indiana University Richard M.
