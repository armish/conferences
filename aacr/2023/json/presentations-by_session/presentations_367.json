[{"Abstract":"Despite decades of research, there are still no effective targeted treatments for the nearly 45% of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients harboring a mutation in their <i>KRAS<\/i> gene. Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is an epigenetic regulator undergoing clinical trials as a potential therapeutic target for cancer. Our group has previously reported that PRMT5 is overexpressed in <i>KRAS<\/i> mutant CRC when compared to <i>KRAS<\/i> wild-type (WT) CRC, and that PRMT5 inhibition exhibited greater therapeutic efficacy in <i>KRAS<\/i> mutant CRC when compared to <i>KRAS<\/i> WT CRC. We therefore proposed that PRMT5 may be a strong therapeutic target for <i>KRAS<\/i> mutant CRC, and that PRMT5 and <i>KRAS<\/i> may crosstalk. In this study, we investigated several key downstream signal transduction proteins that may be involved in mediating the potential crosstalk between PRMT5 and <i>KRAS<\/i>. This is important, as these key intermediate proteins may be strong therapeutic targets for inhibition, as well as valuable therapeutic targets for combination therapy along with PRMT5 inhibitors. We first conducted a literature review to determine which key downstream proteins may be involved in mediating the potential crosstalk between PRMT5 and <i>KRAS<\/i>. Our initial findings indicated that MYC, p65\/RELA, TP53, P21\/CDKN1A, ELF1, E2F1, and EIF4E may be key downstream proteins involved in mediating the potential crosstalk between PRMT5 and <i>KRAS<\/i>. We next used the STRING database to determine which of the aforementioned proteins have demonstrated interactions with PRMT5 and <i>KRAS<\/i>. We found that PRMT5 and <i>KRAS<\/i> both interact with MYC, p65\/RELA, TP53, P21\/CDKN1A, E2F1, and EIF4E with an interaction score &#62; 0.150. We then used the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) database to analyze the RNA-Seq data of CRC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We first used the GEPIA database to determine which proteins are overexpressed in CRC patient tumor samples compared to normal colon and rectum patient samples. We observed that MYC,<b> <\/b>TP53,<b> <\/b>E2F1, and EIF4E are all over 2-fold overexpressed in CRC patient tumor samples compared to normal colon and rectum patient samples (q &#60; 0.01). We next used the GEPIA database to determine which proteins have an expressional correlation with PRMT5 and <i>KRAS<\/i> in CRC patient tumor samples. We found that MYC,<b> <\/b>E2F1, and EIF4E are all positively correlated with PRMT5 and <i>KRAS<\/i> with an R-Value &#62; 0.70 and a P-Value &#60; 0.01 in CRC patient tumor samples. Our study thus showcases the key downstream signal transduction proteins that may be involved in mediating the potential crosstalk between PRMT5 and <i>KRAS<\/i>. These findings are significant, as these key intermediate proteins may be strong therapeutic targets for inhibition, as well as strong therapeutic targets for a PRMT5 combination therapy. Additional research is currently underway to outline the molecular processes behind MYC,<b> <\/b>E2F1, and EIF4E&#8217;s interactions with both PRMT5 and <i>KRAS<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,PRMT5,Colorectal cancer,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>David Shifteh<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Tzuriel Sapir<sup>2<\/sup>, Moshe Pahmer<sup>3<\/sup>, Sanjay Goel<sup>4<\/sup>, Radhashree Maitra<sup>5<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>College of Medicine, SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, Brooklyn, NY,<sup>2<\/sup>Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Biology, Yeshiva University, New York, NY,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Oncology, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Medical Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center\/Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"23f425f5-e896-40cd-ae75-1fc689298712","ControlNumber":"4625","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

Therefore, initially, it had an impression that targeting mutant K-RAS could be an ideal strategy for treating PDAC. However, after decades of studies, no effective RAS inhibitors reached the clinic, indicating that RAS-oncoprotein is an undruggable target in PDAC. Thus, identifying a new target linked with K-RAS signaling was most needed. Using genetically engineered cell lines and K-RAS-driven genetically engineered mouse models (KC or KPC) with or without pancreas-specific CCN1 conditional knockout background, we identified a positive feedback circuit between CCN1 and mutant K-RAS expression. Moreover, blocking this feedback via conditional knockout of CCN1 in the pancreas significantly reduced invasive phenotypes, PDAC growth, and metastasis in the lung in KC and KPC mice. Mechanistically we found that the K-RAS-CCN1 feedback circuit is regulated by microRNA miR-145 via a feedforward mechanism. Collectively, these studies highlight the clinical potential of targeting CCN1 in PDAC.

Despite the significant progress made, these therapies are not durable: not all patients respond to treatment, and primary or acquired resistances are common. Interestingly, however, while RTK-targeted therapies have no effect on resistant lung cancer cell lines, si\/shRNA-mediated RTK depletion or combined treatments that affect RTK protein levels profoundly impact the growth and survival of these cells, indicating that RTKs are still critical for their proliferation. Thus, strategies to target RTK protein levels hold promise as an option for treating RTK-driven cancers. In our recent studies, we discovered that ubiquitin-specific protease 27X (USP27X) functions are crucial for properly recycling and maintaining EGFR steady-state levels in lung cancer cells. Ablation of USP27X leads to a severe decrease of EGFR steady levels, inhibition of xenograft tumor growth, and sensitization of lung cancer cell lines to targeted therapy. To fully understand the in vivo functions of USP27X in EGFR regulation and lung carcinogenesis, we created a new mouse line carrying a conditional <i>Usp27X<\/i> allele and introduced this allele into the well-established and clinically relevant EGFR<sup>L858R<\/sup> mouse lung cancer model. Ongoing studies will determine whether USP27X can be a critical therapeutic in EGFR-driven lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor,Ubiquitination,Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shamshad Alam<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Amanda Zunic<sup><\/sup>, Swati Venkat<sup><\/sup>, Michael E Feigin<sup><\/sup>, Boyko Atanassov<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Pharmacology & Therapeutics, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"687ef2d0-692d-4694-98f6-411a9acea0fd","ControlNumber":"4760","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Furin overexpression was observed in 44.6% of all PTC cases and it was significantly associated with aggressive clinicopathological parameters and poor outcome. We show that inactivation of Furin suppresses tumor growth, proliferation, migration, invasion, spheroid growth and progression of EMT in BRAF mutant cells, whereas its overexpression in BRAF wild-type PTC cell lines reversed the effect. Mechanistically, Furin inactivation caused MEK\/ERK pathway suppression in BRAF mutant cells, while inhibition of MEK has no effect on Furin expression which suggest Furin is a functional upstream of MEK\/ERK Pathway. Furthermore, study revealed the synergistic antitumor effect of Furin depletion and MEK inhibitor.

HNSCCs often express high levels of Aurora kinase A (AURKA), most studied as a kinase important for mitotic progression in normal cells. Notably the overexpression of AURKA in many cancers allows it to act throughout the cell cycle, acquiring new cancer-promoting activities. While several AURKA inhibitors are in clinical trials, limited efficacy is observed with single treatment, causing us to evaluate potential AURKA combination therapeutic combinations. Particularly relevant to HNSCC, which often overexpress and depend on EGFR, overexpression of AURKA can promote resistance to EGFR inhibitors by mechanisms variously identified as including activation of the EGFR effectors AKT, ERK, and BIM. Using viability and clonogenic assays, we have found that the AURKA inhibitor VIC-1911 synergizes with the EGFR inhibitors afatinib and erlotinib in multiple HNSCC cell lines and retains activity in HNSCC cell models selected for resistance to these EGFR inhibitors. However, AURKA inhibition increases levels of AURKA protein and its protein-stabilizing partner TPX2, counteracting drug effect. We also combined inhibition of AURKA with inhibition of WEE1, a regulator of the G2\/M checkpoint, finding this dual inhibition enhanced levels of apoptosis in EGFR inhibitor resistant HNSCC cell lines. Intriguingly, one recent study reported AURKA can also modulate the glycolytic signaling pathway, increasing the cancer-promoting Warburg effect. We have found that inhibition of AURKA can significantly reduce glycolytic flux in HNSCC cell lines and alter expression and phosphorylation of key glycolytic enzymes. Dual inhibition of AURKA in combination with inhibitors of glycolytic enzymes, or enzymes regulating oxidative phosphorylation, showed marked synergy. These and other results investigating AURKA signaling mechanisms in HNSCC demonstrate that the non-canonical functions of AURKA include viable therapeutic targets that can enhance the efficacy of AURKA inhibition in HNSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aurora kinase,Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),Glycolysis,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Flaviane N da Silva<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Theodore Nguyen<sup>1<\/sup>, Jong Woo Lee<sup>2<\/sup>, Barbara Burtness<sup>2<\/sup>, Erica Golemis<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA,<sup>2<\/sup>Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"02bf2268-547f-4663-bac9-271d4f9b4818","ControlNumber":"7855","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

Mutant IDHs (mIDHs) cause accumulated 2-HG, leading to blockage of cell differentiation, thereby inducing malignant transformation. Rare cases were identified carrying co-existing mutations in IDH1 and IDH2. mIDH isoform switching, from mutant IDH1 to mutant IDH2 and vice versa, have been reported as a mechanism of acquired resistance to IDH inhibition in AML and cholangiocarcinoma. Thus, simultaneous inhibition on both mIDH1 and mIDH2 may be a promising strategy to overcome resistance and improve clinical efficacy. HMPL-306, a dual inhibitor of mIDH1\/mIDH2, developed by HUTCHMED, is being evaluated in clinical trials.<br \/>Methods: The inhibition of HMPL-306 on IDH enzymes, including mutant and wild type, was determined by fluorescence-based assay. The selectivity of HMPL-306 was evaluated in 322 kinases (SelectScreen<sup>TM<\/sup>) and 88 proteins (Cerep). For cellular activities of HMPL-306, 2-HG production and differentiation were detected in cells harboring mIDH. Human tumor xenograft models carrying IDH1 or 2 mutations were established for evaluating mIDH inhibition by detecting 2-HG in plasma and tumor, and anti-tumor efficacies.<br \/>Results: HMPL-306 inhibited mutant IDH enzyme activities including IDH1R132H, IDH2R140Q and IDH2R172K, while showed weaker inhibition on IDH1\/2 wild type enzymes. HMPL-306 had a superior selectivity profile in a kinase panel and a safety panel, while enasidenib, an approved mIDH2 inhibitor, inhibited Adenosine-A3 with IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 12 nM. In cellular assays, HMPL-306 displayed comparable activities to enasidenib and ivosidenib (approved mIDH1 inhibitor) and suppressed 2-HG through inhibition of mIDH1 or mIDH2 at similar level, indicating an equal potency against mIDH1 and 2. Moreover, in both mIDH1\/2 cells, HMPL-306 reduced the levels of histone methylation, and promoted hemoglobin &#947; and Kruppel1 gene expression, which led to differentiation from immature malignant cells to mature normal cells. Oral administration of HMPL-306 remarkably decreased 2-HG level in plasma and tumor tissues in xenograft models carrying mIDH1 or mIDH2 and the inhibition is more potent and durable than either ivosidenib or enasidenib at the same dose. Pharmacokinetics (PK) study in rodents showed high exposures of HMPL-306 in brain and cerebrospinal fluid, a desirable feature for glioma therapy. Combination treatment of HMPL-306 and azacitidine synergized in releasing the differentiation block in mIDH AML cells. HMPL-306 also significantly improved <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor efficacy of chemotherapy drugs in solid tumor models with mIDH1\/2.<br \/>Conclusion: HMPL-306 is a potent, dual inhibitor of IDH1\/2 mutation. The strong activity and favorable PK profiles support further clinical evaluation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"IDH1,Mutations,Drug discovery,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Na Yang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jia Hu<sup><\/sup>, Tingwen Li<sup><\/sup>, Juntao Yu<sup><\/sup>, Dongxia Shi<sup><\/sup>, Min Cheng<sup><\/sup>, Zeyu Zhong<sup><\/sup>, Jian Wang<sup><\/sup>, Yang Sai<sup><\/sup>, Weiguo Qing<sup><\/sup>, Guangxiu Dai<sup><\/sup>, Yongxin Ren<sup><\/sup>, Michael Shi<sup><\/sup>, Weiguo Su<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>HUTCHMED Limited, Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3c0cc774-bca0-468d-95f4-2c106ec9624b","ControlNumber":"2365","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;N.

Work from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has identified the tumor suppressor gene <i>TP53<\/i> as one of the GBM drivers. However, in contrast to several cancers, only ~ 35% of GBM cases carry mutations in the <i>TP53<\/i> gene. Furthermore, recent work from our lab showed that <i>TP53<\/i> mutations emerge as &#8216;late&#8217; events during GBM growth. This led us to hypothesize that wild-type (wt) Tp53 function is impaired in GBM. To test our hypothesis, we used clinical and molecular data of 591 GBM patients from TCGA and compared survival, age, gender, race, <i>TP53<\/i> levels, and <i>MGMT<\/i> methylation status between wt and mutant patients. We also compiled a list of key players regulating Tp53 activity and used expression data to (i) compare the correlation of <i>TP53<\/i> levels with the expression of each player and (ii) identify differentially expressed genes between our two groups. Our preliminary data suggest that wt <i>TP53<\/i> patients live less in comparison to mutant patients and that both groups respond similarly to treatment, suggesting impairment of wt Tp53 function. We did not observe differences in age, sex, race, <i>TP53<\/i> levels, or <i>MGMT<\/i> methylation status between the two groups. However, correlation analysis revealed that, among Tp53 activators, <i>MAPK8 <\/i>shows a strong negative correlation with <i>TP53<\/i> expression in the wt group, raising the possibility that Tp53 function may be impaired. Furthermore, gene expression analysis of key Tp53 players showed that approximately 21% are differentially expressed between wt and mutant patients. Altogether, our results suggest that Tp53 function is impaired in wt patients and provide insights into the possible players affecting its activity. Our future work will focus on validating these results using GBM patient-derived cells and mouse models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,TP53,Tumor suppressor gene,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Leopoldo A.

On the other hand, in cancer cells, aberrations or mutations of the pathway components usually could lead to constitutive activation of the pathway, resulting in dysregulation of these cellular processes. Notably, mutations of MAPK pathway components are found in 18% of head and neck cancer (HNC). Among these, mutations of the serine\/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf (<i>BRAF<\/i> gene) account for about 1.8% of HNC (based on TCGA-HNSCC cohort, USA). Serving as one of the key kinase members of the MAPK pathway, BRAF is considered as a precision drug target in various cancer types, including melanoma, thyroid cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). While the significance of <i>BRAF<\/i> mutations remains underexplored in HNC, exceptionally favorable responses to BRAF and MEK inhibition had been reported in HNC patients carrying <i>BRAF<\/i>-mutations. Based on this, we hypothesize that <i>BRAF<\/i> mutations may confer drug sensitivity and serve as a predictive biomarker for personalized therapy in HNC. Here, we demonstrated that ectopic overexpression of mutated BRAF resulted in MAPK pathway activation in HNC cell models. We also showed that ectopic <i>BRAF<\/i><sup>V600E<\/sup> could promote the <i>in vitro<\/i> growth of head and neck cancer cells in both 2D and 3D culture conditions as well as enhance anoikis resistance, which is a prerequisite for metastasis. Further preliminary results showed that the mutated <i>BRAF<\/i><sup>V600E<\/sup> mutant could promote the invasiveness of HNC cells. In summary, our findings support that targeting the <i>BRAF mutants<\/i> could be a potential therapeutic approach or precision treatment for HNC.

Most patients present with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) that is treated with bladder preserving approaches. However, recurrence is high with a 50% chance to progression into muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Patients with MI disease are treated with aggressive surgery and\/or systemic chemo-radiation, and more recently immune- and targeted therapies. Patients with BCa require life-long surveillance with expensive imaging, and repeated treatment courses, making BCa one of the most expensive malignancies throughout the patients&#8217; lifespan. BCa therapies have been stagnant for almost four decades until 2016 when new immune and targeted therapies were approved for patients with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic disease, with an overall response of 15-29%. Thus, better understanding of the pathobiology of BCa is needed to identify actionable targets and develop novel therapeutics. In this respect, we have identified histone lysine demethylase 4A (KDM4A)<b>, <\/b>also known as Jumanji D2A (<i>JMJD2A)<\/i> as a BCa onco-protein. We found that the expression of nuclear KDM4A significantly correlated with disease stage in patients&#8217; tumors and in tobacco carcinogen-induced murine bladder tumors. KDM4A transcript expression significantly increased in bladder tumors compared to normal in TCGA data and three independent publicly available datasets. Knockdown of KDM4A in BCa cell lines significantly inhibited their proliferation and invasiveness. Interestingly, KDM4A transcripts exhibited significant inverse correlation with BCa tumor suppressor SPARC in five independent datasets. In addition, using phenotypic screening and computational modeling, we found that KDM4A is a direct target of verteporfin, a potent inducer of SPARC expression in BCa cell lines. Mechanistically, knockdown of KDM4A in BCa cell lines increased SPARC expression, whereas its overexpression inhibited basal and verteporfin-induced SPARC expression. Chromatin immune-precipitation (ChIP) assays indicated that verteporfin significantly inhibited the association of KDM4A with SPARC promoter. Together, our data underscore the oncogenic role of KDM4A in BCa and its potential as an actionable target.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,KDM4A,Oncogene,verteporfin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Bailey  O.

We and others demonstrated that miRNA-10b is a critical driver of tumor cell viability, especially in the metastatic setting. Based on this discovery, it became feasible to treat established metastatic cancer by inhibiting miR-10b. This was accomplished using a therapeutic, termed TTX-MC138, composed of antagomirs against miR-10b, conjugated to dextran-coated iron oxide nanoparticles. In our previous studies in murine models of metastatic breast cancer, we demonstrated the effectiveness of TTX-MC138 at preventing and eliminating existing metastases. Here, we describe the application of TTX-MC138 for the treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. TTX-MC138 was administered weekly via intravenous injection into mice bearing orthotopic xenografts derived from human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells. Tumor burden was measured by in vivo bioluminescence imaging. Animal survival, body weight, and tumor and metastatic burden at necropsy were also analyzed. Serum and tumor miR-10b expression, as well as global gene expression using RNA-seq were assessed to provide insight into target engagement and molecular function. Animals treated with vehicle or gemcitabine served as controls. Tumor growth rate was found to be significantly lower in animals treated with TTX-MC138 vs controls (p &#60; 0.0001 for TTX-MC138 vs. PBS and vs. gemcitabine). Importantly, 40% of the animals treated with TTX-MC138 regressed their tumors completely as measured by bioluminescence imaging. Treatment continued for 10 weeks, after which the responding mice were monitored for disease recurrence without treatment for an additional 10 weeks. The animals showed evidence of continued weight gain and durable survival. They were sacrificed 10 weeks after treatment was discontinued, despite no evidence of morbidity, to perform necropsy. No tumors or metastases were found at the time of sacrifice. Gene expression analysis confirmed target engagement and molecular mechanism of action. Against the background of our earlier work, these studies provide further evidence of the potential of TTX-MC138 for cancer therapy and expand its relevance beyond metastatic breast cancer to also include pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,Pancreatic cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Subrata Ghosh<sup>1<\/sup>, Douglas Lazarus<sup>2<\/sup>, Neil Robertson<sup>1<\/sup>, Edward Crosier<sup>1<\/sup>, Peter Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Zdravka Medarova<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>TransCode Therapeutics, Boston, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Avastus Preclinical Services, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ce295ce0-f015-4aca-bcf8-e728757b7661","ControlNumber":"1342","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

It has been shown that activating mutations in KRas are among the most common oncogenic drivers of tumorigenesis. Missense mutations of KRas result in constitutive activation due to impaired hydrolysis of GTP which enhances tumor-promoting downstream signaling pathways. Most KRas mutations are located in exon 2 or 3 including the most frequently changed glycine 12 which is present in most pancreatic cancers as well as in colorectal cancers and lung adenocarcinomas. Although direct inhibition of KRas is challenging due to its small size, smooth surface and limited druggable pockets on its surface, first promising drug candidates for selected KRas mutants have been developed in recent years (e.g. Sotorasib, MRTX1133, BI-2852). It was the aim of this study to characterize the selective inhibitory effects of KRas inhibitors in a panel of cancer cell lines harboring different KRas mutations like G12C, G12V or G12D. So, we applied different cellular techniques including phosphorylation assays as well as 2D proliferation and 3D spheroid assays to screen KRas inhibitors for their effect on distinct KRas mutants. Firstly, inhibitors were tested in a cellular assay monitoring phosphorylation of the downstream target ERK at residues Thr202\/Tyr204. Analysis applying the cellular pERK AlphaLisa assay showed a high selectivity of several inhibitors for specific KRas mutants, while RAF and MEK inhibitors showed no significant selectivity in the panel of cancer cell lines tested here. Next, KRas inhibitors were tested in a cellular 2D proliferation and a 3D spheroid assay to determine the inhibitory effect on cell growth in both settings. In line with published data, for some inhibitors we could observe a high selectivity for a specific KRas mutant which was even more pronounced in the 3D format as compared to the 2D setup. Most likely due to the fact that 3D growth assays mimic physiological conditions more closely than 2D settings. Interestingly, in the 2D and 3D assays we could not find such a clear inhibitory effect of the MEK and RAF inhibitors as compared to the cellular pERK assay. These results indicate that the described cellular pERK AlphaLisa assay established for selected cancer cell lines could be a useful tool to screen newly developed KRas inhibitors for their selective inhibition of specific KRas mutants. Additionally, the application of not only 2D proliferation but also 3D growth studies can further characterize the inhibitory potential of these KRas inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Oncogene,Signal transduction inhibitors,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Franziska Fimm-Todt<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Ezgi Dikici<sup><\/sup>, Katharina Schaich<sup><\/sup>, Oliver Siedentopf<sup><\/sup>, Joachim Lauterwasser<sup><\/sup>, Daniel Feger<sup><\/sup>, Jan Erik Ehlert<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Reaction Biology Europe GmbH, Freiburg, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"804716ce-4a10-40cb-9ced-f20fb5c3d4b8","ControlNumber":"6027","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

TP53 missense and nonsense mutations are present in about 50% and 7-12% of the p53 driven cancer, respectively. To date there is no effective treatment for rescuing p53 function in cancers harboring p53 nonsense mutations. We have developed a new potent strategy combining mRNA with a tumor selective nanocarrier, to rescue of p53 tumor suppressor functions as potential therapeutic approach in cancers. ADGN-531 contains proprietary p53-mRNA complexed with proprietary short amphipathic peptides that form stable neutral nanoparticles. ADGN-531 was evaluated on 20 different cancer cell lines harboring different types of p53 mutations. <i>In-vivo<\/i> efficacy of IV-administered ADGN-531 nanoparticles (weekly, 0.5 &#38; 1.0mg\/kg) was evaluated on colorectal SW403 (p53 nonsense\/KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup>), osteosarcoma SaOs2 (p53 null) and lung H358 (p53 null\/KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>) mouse xenografts. Sensitivity to Veliparib (PARPi) following ADGN-531 treatment was evaluated on PARPi resistant SUM-149PT and OVCAR-8 and PARPi sensitive MDA-MB436 cells. ADGN-531\/AMG-510 synergy was evaluated on H358 and M-PACA cells and H358 mouse xenograft. ADGN-531 markedly delay the growth of a large panel of cancer cells harboring p53-missense or nonsense mutations, by rescuing p53 transcriptional activity and subsequent expression of its target proteins. ADGN-531 induces cell cycle arrest in G1 due to p21 upregulation and apoptosis following BAX and PUMA activation. ADGN-531 mediated p53 function rescue is directly correlated to the type of p53 mutation in the cancer cells. ADGN-531 induces 80% cell proliferation inhibition in p53 null\/nonsense cells and 20 to 50% in p53 missense cells. IV-administration of ADGN-531 resulted in dose responsive tumor growth inhibition. ADGN-531 (1.0mg\/kg) induces 40-60% tumor regression SaOs2, SW403 and H358 xenografted mouse model. We demonstrated a synergistic combination between ADGN-531\/AMG-510 a KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor in human lung carcinoma. ADGN-531 (0.5mg\/kg, weekly)\/AMG-510 (10mg\/kg, daily) induces about 80% tumor regression, higher than with either single agents. We demonstrated that ADGN-531 mediated p53 rescue markedly improves (200 fold) and restores the sensitivity of ovarian and breast cancer cells to Veliparib.

MDM2 is best characterized as a p53-targeting E3-ubiquitin ligase, and significant efforts have been made to develop inhibitors that function to block MDM2-p53 binding and subsequent ubiquitination, thereby stabilizing p53. One such inhibitor, milademetan (RAIN-32), for instance has progressed to the clinic and has completed phase I and II trials both alone and as a combination agent in several hematological malignancies and solid tumors, and a phase III trial (MANTRA, NCT04979442) is currently underway. Given the role of p53 in contributing to transcriptional activation of MDM2, however, such inhibitors of MDM2-p53<sup>WT<\/sup> interaction serve to increase cellular levels of MDM2, a result which we have confirmed across several MDM2-p53 inhibitors and cell lines. Non-p53 mediated roles of MDM2 have become of increasing interest in recent years, and we have previously reported on MDM2 mediated immune effects. Further, studies of immune checkpoint blockade driven hyperprogressive disease in clinical cases have preliminarily identified MDM2 amplification as a potential predictor. Indeed, use of small-molecule degrader SP-141 which drives MDM2 autoubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis in both p53<sup>WT<\/sup> and p53<sup>-\/-<\/sup> HCT116 cell lines demonstrates a remarkably similar IC50 (523 and 505 nM, respectively, at 72h) that suggests the importance of non-p53-dependent MDM2 pathways. ONC201 is a small molecule imipridone that is currently in clinical trials for brain cancers and a variety of other tumor types. Initially identified for its role in driving the TRAIL-pathway and integrated stress response (ISR), we recently identified an additional effect of ONC201 in demonstrably reducing detectable MDM2 levels in cell lines upon treatment. Preliminary investigation into this effect suggests synergism in combination with milademetan treatment, with the MDM2-p53 inhibition driven increase in MDM2 levels being abolished upon cotreatment of ONC201 and milademetan. Further exploration of this combination is underway, and may serve as a novel translatable therapeutic approach, particularly in combination with checkpoint blockade.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MDM2,Imipridone,Combination therapy,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Andrew George<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ilyas Sahin<sup>2<\/sup>, Shengliang Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Maximilian Schwermann<sup>1<\/sup>, Francesca Di Cristofano<sup>3<\/sup>, Morgan Turcotte<sup>1<\/sup>, Charlotte DeGeorge<sup>4<\/sup>, Wafik  S.

Apart from tumor cells&#8217; intrinsic ability to escape from therapy, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting the contribution of extrinsic factors, produced by <u>c<\/u>ancer-<u>a<\/u>ssociated <u>f<\/u>ibroblasts (CAFs). Despite the multitude of studies that demonstrated the ability of multiple CAF-produced factors to reduce the sensitivity of tumor cells to ALKi, the contribution of these effects toward responses <i>in vivo<\/i> remains unresolved. To study the impact of stroma on the ability of tumor cells to survive and develop resistance to ALKi, we derived multiple isolates of fibroblasts from clinical samples. Consistent with previous reports, we found that co-culture with CAFs or CAF-conditioned media protects tumor cells against ALKi. We observed that the degree of protection varies between different CAF isolates. This variability in the extent of protection could be attributed to variability in the levels of secreted <u>h<\/u>epatocyte <u>g<\/u>rowth <u>f<\/u>actor (HGF) a known paracrine mediator of environmental resistance. Moreover, exogenous HGF phenocopied the effect of CAFs while blocking HGF-cMET signaling with neutralizing antibodies or pharmacologically abrogated the protective effect. To test the relevance of these findings <i>in vivo<\/i>, we took advantage of the inability of murine HGF to activate human cMET by comparing the response of ALK+ xenograft tumors to front-line ALKi alectinib between NSG mice and NSG-derivative strain with humanized HGF. In contrast to the <i>in vitro<\/i> data, HGF status had only a minimal impact on the remission-relapse dynamics of xenograft tumors. This lack of differences reflected a strong HGF-independent sheltering effect of the stromal niche. Our histological analyses of samples at different points of remission-relapse response revealed that while alectinib potently suppressed tumor cell proliferation, proximity to stroma reduced this cytostatic effect, without impacting cell proliferation in the absence of therapy. To gain insights into the mechanistic underpinning of this HGF-independent effect, we used spatial transcriptomics, comparing stroma-proximal and stroma-distant tumor regions. These analyses, as well as functional validation studies, indicate that stroma-sheltering effects are mediated by multiple mechanisms, acting in an additive fashion. In summary, our studies indicate that therapy resistance of tumor cells reflects the combined action of both intrinsic and microenvironmental factors. Our findings indicate that focusing on a single resistance mechanism at a time is unlikely to induce strong, durable responses. Instead, tackling the issue of therapy resistance necessitates the consideration of multiple resistance mechanisms as well as the moving target nature of tumors under therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-06 Role of microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stroma,Therapy resistance,Targeted therapy,NSCLC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Bina Desai<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Tatiana Miti<sup><\/sup>, Daria Miroshnychenko<sup><\/sup>, Viktoriya Marusyk<sup><\/sup>, Chandler Gatenbee<sup><\/sup>, Menkara Henry<sup><\/sup>, Uwe Rix<sup><\/sup>, Alexander Anderson<sup><\/sup>, Eric Haura<sup><\/sup>, David Basanta<sup><\/sup>, Andriy Marusyk<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>H.

OS often involve mutations of tumor suppressors <i>RB1 <\/i>and <i>TP53<\/i>. One putative proto-oncogene in OS is <i>SKP2<\/i>, which codes for a substrate-recognition factor of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase. We have demonstrated that germline knockout of <i>SKP2<\/i> in a pre-clinical transgenic mouse model of OS doubly deficient in <i>Rb1<\/i> and <i>Trp53<\/i> improved survival, delayed tumorigenesis, reduced malignant cell proliferation, slowed tumor growth, diminished stemness, and induced apoptosis. However, the role that <i>SKP2<\/i> plays in OS progression remains unclear.<br \/>Method: We performed bulk RNA-sequencing on pre-clinical transgenic mouse models of OS. To model OS in mice, we generated a conditional double-knockout line of <i>Trp53<\/i> and <i>Rb1<\/i> mutations induced in cells of the bone-forming osteoblast lineage via Cre-Lox recombination (&#8220;DKO&#8221;: Osx1-Cre;Rb1<sup>lox\/lox<\/sup>;p53<sup>lox\/lox<\/sup>). We compared this with a triple-knockout model, which additionally features a germline <i>Skp2<\/i> knockout (&#8220;TKO&#8221;: Osx1-Cre;Rb1<sup>lox\/lox<\/sup>;p53<sup>lox\/lox<\/sup>;SKP2<sup>-\/-<\/sup>). We compared tumors from the TKO and DKO models via bulk RNA-sequencing (n=3 per group) to study differential expression and immune infiltration. We used immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantification to validate differences in immune markers between genotypes. Using the transcriptomic results from the mouse models, we analyzed a human OS patient cohort of 83 participants (NCI TARGET OS) with RNA-seq and clinical data via survival analysis to infer the impact of modulating <i>SKP2<\/i> in OS patients.<br \/>Result: We found a large difference in gene expression between the TKO and DKO models. Surprisingly, we observed a dramatic increase in the expression of genes related to immune microenvironment infiltration in TKO tumors compared to DKO. Macrophage transcriptomic signatures were the strongest signal detected (P&#60;0.001), but significant increases in B cells, endothelial cells and T cell signatures were also observed. IHC also showed macrophage markers were higher in TKO (P = 0.08). In the NCI TARGET OS cohort, high expression of genes up-regulated in TKO was significantly correlated with 5-year overall survival (p=0.02). This effect was driven by macrophage transcriptomic signatures. This finding was supported by an immune microenvironment deconvolution analysis, which showed that macrophages and T cells were associated with improved overall survival in the patient cohort (p=0.01). We are currently performing single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis to study immune infiltration and cellular heterogeneity in more detail.<br \/>Conclusion: Taken together, our new findings indicate that <i>SKP2<\/i> modulation in OS may induce a vigorous anti-tumor immune activation especially in the form of macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-06 Role of microenvironment in therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microenvironment,Macrophages,Genomics,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alexander Ferrena<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jichuan Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Ranxin Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Rui Yang<sup>2<\/sup>, David Geller<sup>2<\/sup>, Bang Hoang<sup>2<\/sup>, Deyou Zheng<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Genetics and Department of Neuroscience, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6ea2ae2d-018d-4611-91f7-b6a44360df03","ControlNumber":"4552","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Mycobacterium w (Mw, also known as Mycobacterium indicus pranii) is a non-pathogenic strain of mycobacterium which has been used as an immunomodulator against leprosy, tuberculosis and several cancers and is approved for treatment of NSCLC along with chemotherapy in India. Mw promotes a Th1 immune response and its administration in tumor bearing animals is associated with an increase in total number of tumor infiltrating immune cells (TIIC) with decrease in FOXP3 and PD-1 expressing TIIC in pancreatic cancer and melanoma. Previous studies in our lab have shown that Mw promotes mature dendritic cell and activated CD8+ T cell accumulation within the tumor microenvironment in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer. We compared the effects Mw with standard of care doxorubicin on OS tumor progression in a subcutaneous K7M2 syngeneic mouse model. Mw treatment was more effective at tumor inhibition than doxorubicin. Immunohistochemistry analyses of OS tumors revealed an increase in macrophages following Mw treatment. We aim to further analyze the tumor immune microenvironment using a panel of 28 antibodies to determine alterations due to Mw treatment.

Initially, the cytotoxicity of free payloads with multiple mechanisms of cell kill was assessed. These included tesirine (TS, induces DNA cross-links), deruxtecan (Dxd) and SN38 (inhibit topoisomerase I), and an auristatin (MMAE) and maytansinoid (DM1) (inhibit microtubule polymerization). Across four GBM PDXs with varied EGFR expression (GBM6, 39 and 108- EGFRviii amplified; GBM10 - non-amplified), free TS and MMAE were consistently potent with EC<sub>50<\/sub> values ranging from 0.50-45.9 pM and 7.9-229.1 pM, respectively. In contrast, the other free toxins were less potent; EC<sub>50<\/sub> values: Dxd, 0.21-13.1 nM; SN38, 0.87-5.6 nM; DM1, 2.1-19.9 nM. Based on these results, the 40H3 EGFR-specific IgG was used to construct ADCs with TS and MMAE. 40H3-TS had a drug:antibody ratio (DAR) of 2.5 and was potently cytotoxic in GBM6, GBM39 and GBM108, while minimal cytotoxicity was observed in GBM10 or normal astrocyte SVG-A cells. 40H3-MMAE had a DAR of 3 and was similarly effective in GBM6 and GBM39 but less potent in GBM108, GBM10, and SVG-A. Bystander cytotoxicity was evaluated U87 cells expressing eGFP\/fLuc2 (U87eGFP\/fluc2) or EGFRviii (U87EGFRviii). Using live-cell imaging, U87EGFRviii cells treated with 40H3-TS or 40H3-MMAE had significantly reduced cell confluence relative to control. The same drug treatments in U87eGFP\/fLuc2 cells had no effect on growth\/confluence. However, in a 1:1 mixed culture, overall confluence was reduced from 89% in control to 35% and 32% after 40H3-TS (p&#60;0.0001) or 40H3-MMAE (p&#60;0.0001) treatment, respectively. This bystander killing of U87eGFP\/fLuc2 cells was indicated by a reduction in confluence of green-fluorescent cells from 50% in control versus 29% with 40H3-TS (p&#60;0.0001) and 26% with 40H3-MMAE (p&#60;0.0001) treatment. In GBM39 orthotopic tumors, a single infusion of 10 or 20 &#181;g 40H3-TS via convection enhanced delivery (CED) reduced the bioluminescence signal 7 days post treatment by ~10-fold (p=0.03) as compared to 40H3 control. However, 50% and 80% mortality was observed within a week of infusing 10 and 20 &#181;g 40H3-TS, respectively. Neurotoxicity was associated with neuron loss in treated hemisphere as determined by NeuN staining. In summary, these data highlight the potential for novel EGFR-targeted ADCs to provide potent direct and bystander cytotoxicity to GBM cells. However, further selection and optimization of the conjugated toxins will be required to balance potency and bystander killing with toxicity for EGFR-targeted ADCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Bystander effect,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sonia Jain<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Eric Chun  H.

We were one of the early groups to demonstrate that MSCs can be engineered to carry cytotoxic drugs by using nanoparticle-encapsulated form of the drug. However, tumor homing of MSCs is inefficient. We hypothesized that the targeting effectiveness of MSCs can be significantly improved by incorporating tumor-targeting ligands on the MSC surface that will allow for enhanced arrest and binding within the tumor tissue. In this study, we designed anti-EGFR Ab (cetuximab, Cmab) functionalized MSCs and studied the comparative therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel-loaded, Cmab functionalized MSCs relative to that of paclitaxel-loaded, unfunctionalized MSCs. Cmab functionalized MSCs demonstrated improved binding to A549 adenocarcinoma cells. Mice bearing orthotopic A549 tumors were dosed i.v. with the various treatments. Similar to what we have shown previously, MSCs loaded with paclitaxel nanoparticles were effective in slowing tumor growth and improving the overall survival relative to that of other controls. However, the greatest inhibition of tumor growth was observed in mice that received anti-EGFR Ab functionalized, paclitaxel-loaded MSCs. Compared to a median survival of 21 days for saline and 27 days for paclitaxel-loaded MSC treated group and paclitaxel-loaded IgG functionalized MSCs, Cmab Ab functionalized, paclitaxel-loaded MSCs treated mice resulted in significantly improved median survival of 35 days (p&#60;0.001). Biodistribution studies revealed a sixfold higher retention of functionalized MSCs when compared to unfunctionalized MSCs. These results demonstrate the potential for improved tumor targeting with EGFR-targeted MSCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,Tumor targeting,Mesenchymal stem cell,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Susheelkumar Nethi<sup><\/sup>, <b>Shubhmita Bhatnagar<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Xiaolei Li<sup><\/sup>, Swayam Prabha<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Temple University, Philadelphia, PA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"40edab5f-ddfd-411e-ade8-e0756e1752fc","ControlNumber":"5146","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Enhancing their expression would be an attractive approach for targeted therapy. We have undertaken analysis of ALPP and ALPPL2 protein expression in whole cell extracts (WCE) and the surfaceome of 158 cancer cell lines and found ALPP, and to a less extent ALPPL2, to be expressed on the surface at relatively low levels across multiple cancer types. We explored various means to enhance ALPP expression in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and found that induction of cancer cell quiescence via nutrient deprivation, or treatment with EGFR inhibitors, greatly enhanced ALPP surface expression. Mechanistic studies revealed that enhancement of surface ALPP expression in LUAD cells following gefitinib treatment was mediated through repression of MEK\/ERK signaling and activation of the transcription factor FoxO3a, which was identified as an upstream transcriptional regulator of ALPP. Using xenograft models of LUAD, we further demonstrated that gefitinib treatment upregulates surface expression of ALPP in LUAD cells but not in normal tissues. Combination therapy with gefitinib and an ALPP antibody conjugated with Monomethylauristatin F resulted in enhanced tumor suppression compared with gefitinib alone. Our findings support a novel combination treatment modality that boosts the efficacy of ALPP-ADC directed therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI),placental alkaline phosphatase ,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Lung adenocarcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yihui Chen<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Monica Hong<sup><\/sup>, Hanwen Xu<sup><\/sup>, Jody Vykoukal<sup><\/sup>, Soyoung Park<sup><\/sup>, Yining Cai<sup><\/sup>, Ricardo  A.

DV consists of a novel anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, disitamab, conjugated with the microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a cleavable linker. DV has multimodal antitumor mechanisms of action that include direct cytotoxicity of HER2-expressing cancer cells and bystander effect based-cytotoxicity of neighboring cells, both of which are mediated by the intracellular release of MMAE within the targeted cell. Released MMAE can induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), which promotes immune cell recruitment to the tumor. In addition, DV stimulates Fc-gamma receptor mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), which can lead to target cell death. DV also inhibits HER2-activated downstream signaling pathways, further blocking cell growth and proliferation. In this preclinical study, we investigated the antitumor activity of DV in breast and gastric cancer models, both as a monotherapy and in combination with tucatinib, a HER2-selective oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine for patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer. In vitro, DV demonstrated cytotoxic activity against a panel of breast cancer cell lines with varying levels of HER2 expression, including the HER2-low range, and was more potent than the HER2-directed ADC trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). Internalization assays using time-lapse microscopy of breast cancer cells continuously exposed to labeled naked antibodies showed that disitamab internalized to a greater magnitude than trastuzumab. In a subset of those cell lines, DV showed enhanced internalization compared to other HER2-targeted ADCs, namely T-DM1 and trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd). Similar internalization and cytotoxic activities of DV were observed in gastric cancer cell lines. We explored whether dual HER2 targeting with DV in combination with tucatinib improved the antitumor outcomes. In vitro results demonstrated evidence of enhanced cytotoxicity over single agents when tested in breast and gastric cancer cell lines with a wide range of HER2 expression levels. Investigation of the mechanism of the enhanced cytotoxicity revealed increased DV internalization in the presence of tucatinib, attributable to elevated HER2 levels upon treatment with tucatinib. Overall, these findings provide scientific rationale to explore DV in HER2-positive and HER2-low breast and gastric cancer settings as a monotherapy or in combination with tucatinib.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HER2,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Kelsi Willis<sup><\/sup>, Katie Snead<sup><\/sup>, Robert Thurman<sup><\/sup>, Margo Zaval<sup><\/sup>, <b>Anita Kulukian<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Seagen, Seattle, WA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"22eed299-8948-4f10-b544-5630d97bcd79","ControlNumber":"5239","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;K.

Among them, HER2 is overexpressed in several cancers with or without gene amplification with prognostic and predictive implications. In 15-30% of breast cancers, HER2 overexpression and amplification are associated with shorter disease-free and overall survivals along with resistance to hormonal agents as well as increased risk of brain metastasis. Two types of HER2 targeting have been developed: anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Trastuzumab is a humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody that binds to domain IV of HER2 extracellular segment and blocks its signaling. It is the first therapeutic antibody targeting Her2 overexpression approved by the FDA. More recently, two antibody drug conjugates using trastuzumab have been approved: Ado-Trastuzumab-Emtansine (Kadcyla) consisting of trastuzumab conjugated to the drug mertansine DM1 and fam-trastuzumab-deruxtecan-nhki (Enhertu to deliver the topoisomerase inhibitor deruxtecan. We are reporting here the development of fully human internalizing anti-Her2 antibodies that compete or not with trastuzumab for binding to Her2. These antibodies have been developed by immunizing fully human (TC-Mab mouse) mice with recombinant Her2 protein. After production of hybridoma secreting fully human immunoglobulins, the screening process included inhibition of binding of trastuzumab to Her2 by enzyme linked immunoassay and by Octet epitope binning as well as internalization assay. Several internalizing antibodies able to compete or not with trastuzumab and with high affinity (Kd ranging from 10<sup>-9 <\/sup>M to 10<sup>-12 <\/sup>M) were selected. They were next investigated for their ability to deliver a cytotoxic payload in HER2 overexpressing cells breast cancer cells such as SKBR3, BT474 and AU565. Two antibodies: one competing with trastuzumab and the other one non-competing were further characterized. Data related to these antibodies&#8217; biochemical characteristics as well as their ability to inhibit proliferation in vitro and in vivo in mouse xenografts studies will be presented here. In conclusion, the use of fully human mice in our laboratory provides a powerful and attractive approach to develop fully human monoclonal antibodies against cancer targets allowing to by-pass the need for humanization and affinity maturation of antibodies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),HER2,Antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ginette Serrero<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Binbin Yue<sup>1<\/sup>, Jianping Dong<sup>1<\/sup>, Chun Dong<sup>2<\/sup>, Jun Hayashi<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>A&G Pharmaceutical, Inc., Columbia, MD,<sup>2<\/sup>Precision Antibody, Columbia, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e22bf584-7f15-4a73-a433-61735cc2321d","ControlNumber":"7493","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>G.

Amphiregulin is a single-pass transmembrane protein proteolytically processed by TACE\/ADAM17 to release the soluble EGFR ligand, leaving a residual transmembrane stalk that is subsequently internalized. Here, we describe the development of an antibody drug conjugate, GMF-1A3-MMAE, targeting an AREG neo-epitope revealed following ADAM17-mediated cleavage. The antibody does not interact with uncleaved Amphiregulin, providing a novel means of targeting cells with high rates of Amphiregulin shedding. Using fluorescent dye conjugation, we demonstrated that the antibody is internalized by cancer cells in a manner dependent on the presence of cell surface cleaved Amphiregulin. Antibodies conjugated with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) were cytotoxic in vitro and induced rapid regression of established breast tumor xenografts in immunocompromised mice. We further demonstrate that these antibodies recognize the Amphiregulin neo-epitope in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue, suggesting their utility as a companion diagnostic for patient selection. A pan-cancer tissue microarray analysis indicates that the target is commonly detected (&#62; 50% of cases) in breast, prostate, liver and lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),EGFR,Diagnostic marker,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Kristopher  A.

YL202 is a novel HER3-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) structurally composed of a human anti-HER3 antibody, protease-cleavable linker, and a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor. This ADC was prepared using MediLink&#8217;s TMALIN platform, a proprietary tumor microenvironment activable linker-payload platform, which achieved a high drug-to-antibody ratio through homogeneously conjugated and favorable hydrophilic linker-payload.<br \/>In preclinical studies, YL202 exhibited strong reactivity, highly internalization and potent cytotoxicity toward tumor cells. YL202 also demonstrated significant dose-dependent antitumor activity in cell line- and patient-derived xenograft (CDX and PDX) mouse models representing several cancer types and could induce complete tumor regressions with no observable toxicity. YL202 showed stable PK profile with overlapping ADC and TAb curves in a 28-day cynomolgus monkey study. GLP toxicity studies using cynomolgus monkeys showed that YL202 is well tolerated with calculated therapeutic index (TI, HNSTD\/MED) of ~100 for repeat dosing. No lung or platelet toxicity findings were observed at doses up to the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).<br \/>Based on these preclinical results, it demonstrates that YL202&#8217;s advanced ADC design results in an increased therapeutic margin, and YL201 could be further developed in HER3 positive cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Targeted therapy,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jian Xu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Qing Zong<sup>2<\/sup>, Liang Zhu<sup>2<\/sup>, Qigang Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Sasha Stann<sup>1<\/sup>, Jiaqiang Cai<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>MediLink Therapeutics USA, Inc., Cambridge, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>MediLink Therapeutics (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., Suzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"564599c6-3d0b-4e51-8c22-9972ffbbf350","ControlNumber":"6425","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.
