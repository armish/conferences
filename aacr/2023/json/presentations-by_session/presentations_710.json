[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> Tebentafusp, a bispecific (gp100 x CD3) ImmTAC that can redirect T cells to target gp100+ melanoma cells, has shown a superior overall survival (OS) benefit compared to investigator choice for HLA-A*02:01+ patients (pts) with untreated metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM). Although local control rates for primary UM are high, a minority of patients with mUM have recurrent or untreated orbital disease. Here we present safety and efficacy from tebentafusp treated mUM pts with orbital lesions including intraocular lesions.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Tumor response according to RECIST v1.1 and ocular Adverse Events (AEs) were assessed in a pooled analysis of mUM pts with orbital lesions from 3 tebentafusp trials: IMCgp100-01 (Phase (Ph) 1\/2, 19 2L+ mUM pts), IMCgp100-102 (Ph 1\/2 2L+ mUM, 146 pts) and IMCgp100-202 (Ph3 1L mUM, 245 tebentafusp pts). Pre-treatment biopsies, taken prior to the IMCgp100-202 trial, were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for gp100 and CD3+ or CD8+ T cell infiltration prior to tebentafusp treatment.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b> In the 3 clinical trials, 12 mUM pts with radiologically detectable orbital lesions received tebentafusp, the majority of which were intra-ocular. All lesions were stable or had achieved shrinkage. 5\/12 pts had orbital target lesions (TL), of which 4\/5 had achieved tumor shrinkage (best % change -3 to -40) and 1\/5 had no change in tumor size. All non-target orbital lesions were stable or achieved a complete response. 9 eye disorder AEs occurred in 5 pts, the majority of which were G1. The most common (7\/9) AEs were extra-ocular local edema. One G3 eye pain AE, in a post eviscerated eye, did not resolve and occurred in the setting of disease progression resulting in treatment discontinuation. All other eye disorder AEs recovered and none led to tebentafusp discontinuation. 37 primary UM and 195 liver metastasis baseline biopsies were evaluated. Expression of gp100 in primary UM and mUM was high (95% and 80%, respectively). CD3+ and CD8+ T cell numbers were generally lower in primary UM compared to liver metastasis (median CD3: 231 and 504 cells\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>, p=0.035; CD8: 121 and 238 cells\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>, p=0.53, respectively).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Following tebentafusp treatment, tumor reduction or stabilization of all orbital lesions including intra-ocular lesions were observed. Most AEs were extra-ocular mild local edema. Primary UM showed a high level of gp100 expression and also T cell infiltration. These preliminary signals of tebentafusp activity in orbital disease, including intra-ocular lesions, suggest a role for tebentafusp as a neoadjuvant therapy in UM and warrant further investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL04-01 Clinical outcomes research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Uveal melanoma,Immuno-oncology,T cell engager,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marcus O.

Nonetheless, cancer recurrence has been frequently utilized as a surrogate endpoint, particularly in the context of multi-gene assays and molecular signatures. The 21-gene recurrence score (RS) was originally established against distant recurrence for prognosis in breast cancer. However, it is unclear whether RS has a weight for the recurrence over survival prognosis. We investigated RS on the choice of clinical endpoints in the Trial Assigning Individualized Options for Treatment (TAILORx), which had OS, invasive disease-free survival (DFS), and recurrence-free interval (RFI) in addition to distant recurrence-free interval as the clinical endpoints. Both midrange (11-25) and high-range (26-100) scores were associated with RFI, high-range only with DFS, but not significantly associated with OS in the multivariable Cox proportional-hazards regression models. Of 462 death events, 33.1% (153 events) were ascribed to breast cancer and 91.8% (424) were due to DFS-related events that included 24.5% other cancers, 34.2% unknown and 33.1% breast cancer. It is DFS that was wound up as the most representative surrogate endpoint for survival. The lack of survival significance was probably due to the nature of 21-gene assay weighted for recurrence rather than not having enough event numbers in the TAILORx clinical trial. The data call for establishing biomarkers directly towards OS or DFS to increase survival with more precision.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL04-01 Clinical outcomes research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Overall survival,Breast cancer,Prognosis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sherry X.

These SVs can produce overexpression or loss-of-function of certain genes, or generate chimeric fusion proteins. Thus, they serve as important disease biomarkers across several cancers and can also represent therapeutically targetable alterations. Detecting these SVs at a gene-level resolution can be challenging with lower resolution karyotyping approaches, or even RNA sequencing approaches, due to difficulties with culture, sample stability, low transcript abundance, or low-quality RNA. In addition, the ability of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques to detect gene fusions is limited by the targeted nature of these assays as they depend heavily on the design and selection of each probe. Here we use a novel method, Arima-HiC sequencing, that utilizes DNA to evaluate 12 pediatric leukemia samples and determine this assay&#8217;s effectiveness in detecting clinically-relevant SVs. We first selected 5 archived (cryopreserved) pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples (archival period range: 1-4 years) known to be either fusion-positive (n=3) or fusion-negative (n=2) via prior clinical genetic testing (i.e., chromosomes, FISH, and\/or microarray). All samples underwent Arima-HiC sequencing. Briefly, chromatin digestion, end-labeling, and proximity ligation were performed prior to DNA purification per the Arima-HiC protocol. Purified DNA was next prepared as a short-read sequencing library and sequenced on a HiSeq X. The raw reads were aligned and deduplicated, and SVs were called using HiC-Breakfinder software. For a discovery set, we then additionally selected 7 pediatric leukemia samples&#8212;6 precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) and 1 AML&#8212;for Arima-HiC sequencing (as above). These cases had undergone standard-of-care cytogenetic (karyotyping, FISH, microarray) and\/or molecular (targeted cancer NGS sequencing panel) testing clinically, and a genetic driver \/ known gene fusion had not been identified. Using Arima-HiC sequencing, we identified the clinically-relevant SV in each of our 3 fusion-positive AML cases, consistent with the original diagnostic cytogenetic finding (n= 1 <i>RUNX1<\/i>-<i>RUNX1T1<\/i> fusion, 1 <i>CBFB<\/i>-<i>MYH11<\/i> fusion, and 1 <i>CBFA2T3<\/i>-<i>GLIS2<\/i> fusion). The 2 fusion-negative AML cases were also negative for structural gene fusions by HiC data. In our discovery sample set, Arima-HiC sequencing was able to find clinically-relevant SVs that were not previously detected in 3 of 6 samples: a <i>KMT2A<\/i>-<i>MLLT10<\/i> fusion was found in an AML case, and a <i>ZNF384<\/i>-<i>EP300<\/i> fusion was found in each of 2 ALL cases. A <i>ABHD17B-PTK2B<\/i> fusion was found in another ALL case, although <i>ABHD17B<\/i> may be a novel partner <i>PTK2B<\/i> and is undergoing validation. Rearrangements involving <i>KRAS<\/i> and <i>EGFR<\/i> were detected in the final two ALL cases, and are also undergoing validation. Overall, this study demonstrates how Arima-HiC sequencing can provide diagnostic value in pediatric leukemia specimens via the identification of clinically relevant SVs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL08-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene fusion,Biomarkers,Leukemias,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anthony Schmitt<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shadi Melnyk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristin Sikkink<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lisa Lansdon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tomi Pastinen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erin Guest<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Midhat Farooqi<\/i><\/presenter>.

In the phase 3 FLAURA study, patients with exon 19 deletions (ex19del) had a median progression-free survival (mPFS) of 21.4 months (mo); patients with L858R had a shorter mPFS of 14.4 mo. Poorer outcomes with L858R have also been reported with other 3rd-gen TKIs aumolertinib and lazertinib. These patients are a potential poor-risk subgroup for these therapies.<br \/>Here, we explored outcomes of patients with L858R-driven NSCLC using real-world datasets (RWDs), analyzed potential contributors to poorer outcomes, including co-mutation incidence and osimertinib potency for each mutation, and report preclinical proof of concept of combination treatment BLU-945, an investigational next-gen L858R inhibitor, with osimertinib.<br \/>Methods: Two large RWDs were analyzed for survival outcomes in 1L osimertinib-treated patients with ex19del or L858R from MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC; n=105) and the clinical-genomic Guardant INFORM database (EGFR ctDNA baseline positive; n=1386). IC<sub>50<\/sub>s of osimertinib on <i>EGFR<\/i> mutations and wildtype were determined in BaF3 cells. Preclinical studies of combination BLU-945 and osimertinib were performed in L858R-driven BaF3 xenograft models.<br \/>Results: Both RWDs confirmed poorer prognosis for 1L osimertinib-treated patients with L858R <i>vs<\/i> ex19del. MDACC cohort showed a 12-mo PFS rate of 63% for L858R (n=45) <i>vs<\/i> 82% for ex19del (n=60); mPFS was immature.

Poor prognosis factors (including TP53 mutations and co-mutation number) were not significantly different between L858R and ex19del; both had a similar number of off-target mutations in post-osimertinib samples.<br \/>Strong association was found between osimertinib cellular IC<sub>50<\/sub> and osimertinib clinical trial outcomes (mPFS).

Ependymoma accounts for 5.7% of all childhood and 1.9% of all adult CNS tumors. RELA fusion-positive ependymoma is a subgroup associated with supratentorial location, higher WHO grade and worse prognosis. Diffuse Midline Glioma (DMG) is another relatively rare CNS tumor, originating in the midline locations of the brain (including thalamus, pons and spinal cord), accounting for 10% of all childhood and less than 4% of adult CNS tumors. For ependymoma standard treatment includes surgery and radiation therapy, with limited systemic options other than clinical trials for recurrent disease. For DMG, surgical intervention is restricted to biopsy, with radiation as standard therapy. Systemic options for both ependymoma and DMG are limited.VAL-083 is a bi-functional DNA-targeting agent which rapidly induces inter-strand DNA cross-links at N7-guanine inducing double-strand breaks causing cell death and acts independent of MGMT DNA repair and H3F3 K27M mutation status in high-grade gliomas. We report on 2 patients: one with ependymoma and one with DMG, treated with VAL-083 under an expanded access program. Both patients had recent disease progression and limited therapeutic options. Case #1: a 47-year-old male who was diagnosed with a left parietal high grade (3) anaplastic ependymoma and with IDHwt and unmethylated MGMT promoter status. Inter- and intragenic fusion analysis of tumor tissue revealed RELA fusion-positive ependymoma. He had undergone 2 resections and had received radiation and multiple systemic treatment regimens. Case #2: a 21-year-old male who was diagnosed with DMG of the brain stem, with IDHwt and unmethylated MGMT promoter status. He had undergone radiation therapy, and multiple treatment regimens. Both patients were not eligible to participate in any clinical trial and received VAL-083 under an expanded access program.

Almost all GBM patients experience recurrent\/progressive disease despite upfront standard of care treatment, with a median overall survival of 3-9 mo. after recurrence. There are limited treatment options available upon progression of disease which may include potential participation in clinical trials. However, patients may not meet the strictly defined entry criteria to participate in these clinical trials. VAL-083 is a first-in-class bifunctional alkylating agent that acts independent of O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status. Under an Expanded Access (EA) program, we have treated 24 patients with recurrent GBM, who were not eligible to participate in clinical trials with VAL-083. Four (4\/24; 17%) patients had leptomeningeal disease (LMD) at time of enrolment. While safety data was assessed for all patients, those without LMD (20 patients) were evaluated for efficacy. All patients evaluated for efficacy received chemoradiation with TMZ, and the mean number of adjuvant TMZ cycles was 5 (&#177; 6.2)<i>. <\/i>The median time from last progression to start of VAL-083 was 0.65 mo. (95%CI: 0.32-1.55) and median KPS was 80 (25-75P: 70-90). Eight (8\/20; 40%) patients had 2 or more prior recurrences, 9\/20 (45%) patients had multifocal disease, and 5\/20 (25%) had prior lomustine. Eighteen (18\/20; 90%) patients had unmethylated promoter status for MGMT and 18\/20 (90%) were IDH wild type. All patients had at least 1 mutation, with 11\/20 (55%) having 5 or more mutations, and one patient had hypermutator phenotype with MSH6 mutation. The most common mutations were, TERT 11\/20 (55%), PTEN 9\/20 (45%), and TP53 6\/20 (30%). All patients started treatment with VAL-083 at 30 mg\/m<sup>2 <\/sup>administered on 3 consecutive days every 21 days. Seven patients received bevacizumab concurrently with VAL-083. VAL-083 was well tolerated and the main adverse events were consistent with prior experience, i.e., thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Eight (8\/24; 33%) patients had a dose reduction, 7 of which were due to thrombocytopenia, and 1 due to neutropenia. Five patients with thrombocytopenia had prior lomustine. As of cut-off date (05 Jan, 2023), median progression free survival (mPFS) and median overall survival (mOS) from last disease progression was 5.9 mo (95%CI: 3.9-7.9) and 9.4 mo (95%CI: 3.0-14.3), respectively. In patients without multifocal disease mOS was even longer, 14.3 mo (95%CI: 3.9-14.3). Use of VAL-083 in this expanded access study showed benefit in the treatment of recurrent GBM patients even those who have had multiple recurrences and were not candidates for the treatment through clinical trial.

For comparison, persons diagnosed with same type cancers occurring as first primary cancers (FPCs) were also identified (n=2,131,953). For each cancer type, differences in the risk of cancer-specific or all-cause death between SPC and FPC were estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for potential confounders. Subgroup analyses were conducted to estimate the risk difference between SPC and FPC by antecedent cancer types of those with SPCs.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>During a median follow-up of 6.5 years (interquartile range, 1.8-10.6), cancer-type specific death occurred among 34% of persons with SPCs and among 32% of persons with FPCs. The corresponding proportions for all-cause death were 67% and 53%, respectively. In multivariable models, the risk of cancer-specific death was statistically significantly higher in persons with SPC than in persons with FPC for breast (hazard ratio [HR]=1.43; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.40-1.48), bladder (HR=1.19; 1.09-1.29), corpus uteri (HR=1.10; 1.05-1.15), and colorectal (HR=1.05, 1.03-1.07) cancer, whereas it was lower for lung cancer (HR=0.78; 0.77-0.79). The risk did not vary between groups for prostate cancer (HR=0.92; 0.79-1.06). Subgroup analyses showed large variations in HRs across survivors by antecedent cancer types. In particular, the highest HR associated with SPC (vs FPC) was among ovarian cancer survivors for colorectal cancer (HR=1.31; 1.10-1.56), gallbladder cancer survivors for breast cancer (HR=1.78; 1.09-2.91), head and neck cancer survivors for uterine cancer (HR=1.69, 1.05-2.72), gallbladder cancer survivors for bladder cancer (HR=1.87; 1.06-3.22), while the lowest HR for lung cancer was among testicular cancer survivors (HR=0.54; 0.38-0.76). Associations were generally consistent across strata of diagnosis years, race\/ethnicity, household income, and urbanicity. The risks of all-cause death were also higher among persons with SPC vs FPC, including prostate cancer. Persons with second primary prostate cancer were almost twice as likely to die from all causes as persons with first prostate cancer (HR=1.83; 1.80-1.87).<br \/><b>Conclusion <\/b>Persons with SPC generally have a higher risk of cancer-specific and all-cause death than those with FPC, suggesting that intensive SPC surveillance may benefit those at increased risk of developing SPC.

This observation has led to the assessment of hypomethylating agents (HMAs) as potential drugs to treat oncological patients, being considered the clinical approval of these pharmacological compounds in the therapy of myeloid malignancies as one of the main achievements of this scientific field. A good example is myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a pre-leukemia disorder that can evolve into acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where very few therapeutic options were available until the introduction of HMAs. However, it remains unsolved how we can predict if an MDS patient will response or not to the epigenetic drug and for how long. Using the great analytical power of the newly developed single-cell technologies, we have herein tackled this issue. To study the evolution of the clonal molecular and cellular architecture MDS upon the treatment with HMAs, we performed single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) of an amplicon panel for 53 genes commonly mutated in myeloid malignancies and single-cell protein sequencing (scProt-seq) of 45 cell-surface proteins to provide a simultaneous landscape of the genetic setting and immunophenotype. We sequenced hundreds of thousands of cells from these MDS patients where paired bone marrow samples were obtained at the time of diagnosis and at the end of at least six cycles of azacitidine treatment. Our study has unveiled that the co-occurrence of particular truncating or stop codon mutations in the same myeloid progenitor cell; the multibranched dynamics of the mutant clones; and the persistence of particular cell lineages with distinct mutational profiles (such as non-classical monocytes and CD8+ effector T-cells) can predict the clinical response of MDS patients to HMA therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-04 Epigenetic therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Single cell,Therapeutics,DNA methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ignacio Campillo-Marcos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marta Casado-Pelaez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Veronica Davalos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gerardo Ferrer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Caterina Mata<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisabetta Mereu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Valcarcel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antonieta Molero<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lurdes Zamora<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Palomo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pamela Acha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ana Manzanares<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francesc Solé<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Manel Esteller<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Unfortunately, even though EAC has one of the highest tumor mutation burdens among all cancer types, response to immunochemotherapy (ICI+CTX) is highly variable, and the underlying molecular basis is incompletely understood. While genomic features such as mutations and copy number alterations in EAC are highly variable across samples, DNA methylation array data from numerous studies suggested that EAC can be clustered into a few consistent subtypes. We thus hypothesize that epigenetic heterogeneity of EAC may contribute to or associate with patients&#8217; heterogeneous response to ICI+CTX, possibly through modulation of key genes or neoantigens. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of a unique ICI+CTX LUD2015-005 trial in which inoperable EAC patients received first-line ICI for four weeks (ICI-4W), followed by ICI+CTX. Instead of methylation array, we also used a new DNA methylation sequencing technology, TET-Assisted Pyridine-Borane Sequencing (TAPS), on 64 tumor and 15 adjacent normal tissue samples collected from 23 EAC patients before and throughout treatment. Unlike prior studies that used methylation arrays which only cover ~2.5% of all CpG sites in the genome, TAPS detects genome-wide, base-resolution DNA methylation information. Furthermore, many previous studies did not account for variability in tumor content between samples, which could impact downstream DNA methylation analyses. In view of this, we proposed an analytical framework that includes tumor content and local copy number as key parameters, which estimates the tumor and stromal methylation and tests for differentially methylated regions (DMR). We also performed unsupervised clustering based on large scale genome-wide methylation pattern and revealed 2 major tumor clusters. Using the whole genome data, we identified a large set of shared tumor-specific DMRs, revealing that hypomethylation across wide regions of the genome and hypermethylation of certain gene bodies are common features in EAC. We also identified a set of shared outcome-associated DMRs in pre-treatment samples, which predicts better progression-free survival at 12 months. We further performed subgroup analysis of the 2 tumor clusters. Interestingly, we found higher numbers of cluster-specific prognostic DMRs with stronger effect sizes. This suggests that tumor subtypes may respond differently to treatment, and should be considered separately in statistical analyses. Altogether, these results indicate that a detailed understanding of tumor epigenetic heterogeneity will improve patient stratification in immunochemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-07 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,DNA methylation,Immunotherapy,Cancer genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Phil F.

As such, the clinical benefits of current therapeutic agents remain rather limited for the advanced prostate cancer. Given that expression of constitutively active AR variants (AR-Vs) that lack the ligand-binding domain (LBD) clinically associates with the drug resistance and poor survival, targeting both AR and the LBD-truncated AR-Vs is anticipated an effective approach to overcome therapy resistance. Here, we present Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTAC) compound ITRI-148, capable of effectively degrading both full-length and LBD-truncated AR by targeting the proteins via the N-terminal domain to Cereblon-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. Degradation of AR and AR-V7 suppresses target gene expression, and inhibits cell proliferation with accompanied apoptosis activation in AR-V7-expressing castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cell models. <i>In vivo<\/i>, this compound displays good pharmacokinetics profiles and oral bioavailability with strong antitumor efficacy towards castration-, enzalutamide-resistant CWR22Rv1 and VCaP xenograft models. These data provide compelling evidence that by targeting AR NTD for induced degradation of active AR protein variants, ITRI-148 is a promising agent for the intervention of advanced therapy-resistant prostate cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-04 Hormone signaling and inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteasome-mediated degradation,Androgen receptor,Prostate cancer,Androgen independence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chiu-Lien Hung<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ling-Yu Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chih-Wei Fu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hung-Chih Hsu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hsin-Jien Kung<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, the mechanism how active ESR1 fusions reprogram transcription is not understood. Moreover, the lack of targeted treatment due to the loss of ligand binding domain (LBD) in <i>ESR1 <\/i>gene fusions necessitates the need to develop new therapies targeting active ESR1 fusions that promote tumorigenesis.<br \/>Methods: An estrogen response element (ERE) DNA pull down assay was performed to identify coactivators recruited by active ESR1 fusions. An alamar blue assay was utilized to assess cell growth after treatment with pharmacological inhibitors to the coactivators. Single cells isolated from ER&#945;+ patient-derived xenografts (PDX) were used to form organoids (PDxOs). A CellTiter-Glo 3D assay was conducted to measure the growth of PDxOs after treatment with coactivator inhibitors.<br \/>Results: Using ERE DNA pull down assays, we identified bromodomain-containing proteins (BRDs) and steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs\/p160 family members) as key regulators recruited by active ESR1 fusions from nuclear extracts of breast cancer cells. A pan-BET family inhibitor (BETi), birabresib, and pan-SRC inhibitors (SRCi), SI-2 and SI-12, inhibited the growth of ER&#945; positive breast cancer cells and PDxOs expressing an active ESR1 fusion or LBD point mutation. Importantly, the combination of birabresib and a CDK4\/6 kinase inhibitor (palbociclib) conferred the largest growth reduction of PDxOs expressing an ESR1-YAP1 fusion. RNA sequencing showed BETi and SRCi led to downregulation of ER&#945; target gene expression and cell cycle pathways, with upregulation of apoptosis pathways. Here, we propose a model whereby BRD and SRC protein families are major regulators of active ESR1 fusion-driven gene transcription and growth and positioned the potential therapeutic significance of BETi and SRCi to be tailored to treat active ESR1-translocated breast tumors.<br \/>Conclusions: Active ESR1 fusions cannot be treated with standard-of-care ET due to the lack of the LBD of ER&#945;. Therefore, it is critical to investigate how active, in-frame ESR1 fusion proteins induce gene transcription and to develop molecular mechanism-based targeted therapies. Here, we revealed two groups of coactivators (BRDs and SRCs) as critical transcriptional regulators of active ESR1 fusion-driven tumor biology. Our study demonstrated the efficacy of a BETi (birabresib) and SRCi (SI-2\/SI-12) in inhibiting the viability of active ESR1 fusion\/LBD mutation expressing breast cancer cells and 3D grown PDxOs. Importantly, birabresib combined with a standard-of-care CDK4\/6 inhibitor conferred the best PDxO growth reduction.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-10 Steroid hormone receptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Estrogen receptor,Fusion proteins,Coactivator,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xuxu Gou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Craig T.
