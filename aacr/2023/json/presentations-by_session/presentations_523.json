[{"Abstract":"Here, we present an approach to study the effects of microenvironmental changes on inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity using colorectal cancer (CRC) patient-derived organoids. We identified relevant paracrine interactions between stromal and tumor cells based on the expression of ligand-receptor pairs in single cell-RNAseq data of 12 colorectal cancer patients. Physiological relevance was tested by adding CRC stroma-derived ligands to patient-derived organoids. A systematic screening of different conditions was enabled by multiplexed mass cytometry and scRNAseq analysis. We also aimed to model the effects of a changing extracellular matrix composition, by supplementing the laminin\/collagen IV rich environment with other known ECM proteins such as collagen I to identify the impact of a changing substrate on cell plasticity. We found that ECM parameters as well as niche specific paracrine factors affect proliferation, differentiation, and developmental trajectories of colorectal cancer patient-derived organoids. We hypothesize that supplementing patient-derived organoids in vitro with physiologically relevant factors and substrates may expand the phenotypic space in which organoid cells differentiate, resulting in a more versatile preclinical model system.Our data provide insights into non-genetic sources of inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity resulting in differential drug responses. Additionally, they can serve as guidelines to improve existing patient-derived colorectal cancer models and provide a feasible approach to address common limitations in organoid culture.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-01 Chemokines in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Tumor microenvironment,Colorectal cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jennifer von Schlichting<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Leona Simon<sup><\/sup>, Stefan Peidli<sup><\/sup>, Markus Morkel<sup><\/sup>, Nils Blüthgen<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2574cb60-c4c5-4022-aaec-1a017243e09b","ControlNumber":"7359","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J. von Schlichting, <\/b> None..<br><b>S.

CD39 catalyzes the rate-limiting degradation step of this immunostimulatory ATP, leading to a rise in immunosuppressive adenosine (ADO). CD39 displays broad expression on endothelial cells and macrophages, which represents a significant peripheral sink for CD39 targeting antibodies. Our strategy aims to circumvent this problem through delivery of pH-selective anti-CD39 blocking antibodies that will achieve a high target occupancy in the tumor, maintaining eATP and inhibiting ADO generation to enhance anti-tumor immunity.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> Anti-CD39 antibodies were generated through a yeast-based screening platform and characterized for efficacy of blocking CD39 activity. Cell lines (HEK293 stably overexpressing CD39, parental HEK293, CD39<sup>+<\/sup> SK-MEL28, and CD39<sup>high<\/sup> ARH77) or soluble CD39 protein were incubated with candidate antibodies. CD39 enzymatic activity was determined using CellTiter Glo 2.0 assay (Promega) and EnzCheck Phosphate Assay (Thermo Fisher).<br \/><b>Results<\/b> Monovalent affinity of 83 candidate antibodies was measured; K<sub>D<\/sub>s ranged from 1x10<sup>-9<\/sup> - 5X10<sup>-7<\/sup>M under both physiological (pH 7.4) and acidic (pH 6.0) conditions. All 83 antibodies bound CD39-overexpressing HEK293 cells at pH 6.0; 76 bound CD39-overexpressing HEK293 cells at pH 7.4. We identified 30 antibodies (100 nM) that block CD39 activity on HEK293-CD39 cells (threshold: &#62; 5% inhibition) under either pH 7.4 or pH 6.0 conditions. 26 antibodies inhibit CD39 activity at pH 7.4, whereas 22 antibodies block CD39 at pH 6.0. Among these 30 antibodies, ten (at 200 nM) inhibit CD39 activity on SK-MEL28 cells (moderate CD39 expression) at both pH 7.4 and pH 6.0; 5 of these preferentially inhibit CD39 at pH 6.0 (threshold: &#62; 7.5% inhibition). The 30 antibodies selected above were tested on ARH77 cells (high CD39 expression). Among them, 16 antibodies inhibited CD39 enzymatic activity beyond 10% at pH 6.0 (maximal inhibition: 43%) and &#62; 6.5% at pH 7.4 (maximal inhibition: 35%). All 16 suppressed soluble CD39 activity under both pH conditions. A set of 8 antibodies demonstrating higher efficacy of CD39 inhibition on both cell lines at pH 6.0 versus pH 7.4 were prioritized for lead optimization.<br \/><b>Summary and conclusions<\/b> A panel of 83 antibodies were identified and characterized for inhibition of CD39 enzymatic activity at neutral and acidic pH. The 8 most promising antibodies in terms of pH-selective CD39 binding and inhibition are currently undergoing lead optimization. This pH-dependent TME targeting strategy may alleviate undesirable properties of on-target\/off-tumor binding such as target-mediated drug disposition (that results in suboptimal pharmacokinetic properties) and effectively bolster the specific blocking of CD39 in the local tumor environs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Tumor microenvironment,ATP,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Aiping Bai<sup><\/sup>, Elise Renahan<sup><\/sup>, Kanam Malhotra<sup><\/sup>, Thomas Thisted<sup><\/sup>, <b>F.

Growing evidence supports a role for tumor-infiltrating B cells in complementing T cell-mediated immunity and contributing to the immunomodulation of cancer. Analyses of RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have correlated high expression of B cell genes with improved patient survival in a range of cancer types. However, it is likely that effective anti-tumor immunity involves interactions between both B and T cells. To investigate the relative contribution of B cells to the overall TME across multiple tumor types simultaneously, we have examined a multi-tumor tissue microarray (TMA) comprising 29 different cancer types represented by approximately 12 unique donors per indication and duplicate 1mm cores per donor (1 from invasive margin [IM] and 1 from tumor center [TC]). Serial sections were stained by single-plex immunohistochemistry for CD20, CD3, CD4 and CD8, and immune cells enumerated by digital image analysis (CellProfiler<sup>TM<\/sup>). Analysis of overall immune infiltration regardless of core location (IM and TC combined) revealed tumor indications such as NSCLC, gastric, TNBC, cutaneous SCC and cervical to be most highly infiltrated, and GIST, GBM and prostate to exhibit the fewest tumor-infiltrating immune cells. B cell frequencies correlated with T cell densities for most tumor types with some notable exceptions including, for example, ER+ BC and gallbladder cancer where the proportion of B cells was higher relative to T cells, and TNBC where the converse pattern was evident. Spatial analyses revealed increased B cell frequencies in IM compared with TC, correlating with the distribution of T cells in the TME for the majority of tumor indications. However, a contrasting expression pattern was observed for ER+ BC, NSCLC SCC and cutaneous SCC where B cell frequencies were greater in TC. Clear evidence for presence of B cells in tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) was observed for some tumor donor cores (e.g. gastric cancer). Taken together, we describe the relative distribution of B cells in the TME across multiple tumor types simultaneously. This approach demonstrates the benefits of utilizing an immuno-oncology focussed multi-tumor TMA to interrogate B cell biology and to dissect how heterogeneity of this cell population may contribute to anti-tumor immunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,B cells,Immuno-oncology,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Milan Bhagat<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Leorenzo Memeo<sup><\/sup>, Christopher Womack<sup><\/sup>, Woo Hoo Kim<sup><\/sup>, Marie Cumberbatch<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>TriStar Technology Group LLC, Washington DC, DC","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"71dee2b8-da92-4e96-9b8e-25a0abeaee96","ControlNumber":"7313","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

TIMP3 has demonstrated the ability to inhibit several ADAMTS proteases able to cleave VCAN to Vkine. Here we investigate the correlation of TIMP3 accumulation in CRCs with the VCAN status and CD8+ T cell infiltration.<br \/>Methods: Matched primary and metastatic CRC samples from 156 patients who had resected oligometastatic CRC were stained for VCAN, Vkine, TIMP3, and CD8+ TILs. VCAN, Vkine, and TIMP3 were scored using an intensity binning system ranging from 0-3+ and T cells in the epithelium were reported per high power field (HPF). Tumors were designated as high (2 or 3+) or low (0 or 1) for both VCAN and Vkine and positive (+; 1-3) or negative (0) for TIMP3. Tumors designated VCAN low and Vkine high are considered VCAN proteolytic predominant (VPP) and all other combinations are considered VCAN proteolytic weak (VPW).<br \/>Results: Across the whole dataset, 52% of cancers were VCAN high and 24% were VPP. TIMP3 was detected in 33% of cancers. The frequency of TIMP3 was similar between primary and metastatic tumors (39% and 29%, respectively). Of the VCAN high cancers, 42% were TIMP3+ whereas 61% of the TIMP3+ samples are VCAN high. Of the Vkine high cancers, 44% were TIMP3+ and 36% of VPP cancers were TIMP3+. The prevalence of the VPP phenotype was similar between the TIMP3+ and negative cancers. Additionally, among the TIMP3+ samples 68% were Vkine high versus 46% in TIMP3 negative cancers (p=0.001). VCAN proteolysis correlates with higher CD8+ TIL abundance, thus we assessed the number of CD8+ TILs in TIMP3+ and negative tumors. The TIMP3+ cancers had a median of 2 CD8+ TILs\/HPF and the TIMP3 negative cancers has a median of 3 CD8+ TILs\/HPF. For VPP cancers, those that were also TIMP3+ had a median of 3 CD8+ TILs\/HPF compared to TIMP3 negative cancers which had a median of 6 CD8+ TILs\/HPF (p=0.2).<br \/>Conclusions: TIMP3 correlates with higher levels of VCAN accumulation but does not correlate with lower levels of proteolysis. Future studies are needed to better clarify the impact of TIMP3 and other mediators in regulating VCAN accumulation and proteolysis in the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Extracellular matrix,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anna Field<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sean Kraus<sup>1<\/sup>, Kristina Matkowskyj<sup>2<\/sup>, Dustin Deming<sup>3<\/sup>, Cheri  A.

In this comprehensive study, we performed a detailed multiomic single cell analysis of breast cancers with inherited mutations in different genes (<i>BRCA1<\/i>, <i>BRCA2<\/i>, <i>PALB2<\/i>, <i>ATM<\/i>, <i>CHEK2<\/i>), and wild type mutation negative (WT) patients, stratified by hormone receptor status, to understand the relationship between inherited mutation and immunogenicity. Using spatial tissue multiplexing (PhenoCycler), single cell RNAseq (10X Genomics) and bulk RNAseq, we evaluated cellular markers within the TME associated with DNA damage as well as phenotypes with tumor suppressive (M1, CD8 T cells, NK cells) or tumor promotive (M2, Treg, CAF) properties. We developed a 43-plex antibody panel and characterized eight tissue microarrays containing 443 patient samples from mutation carriers (<i>BRCA1<\/i>: n=142, <i>BRCA2<\/i>: n=118, <i>CHEK2<\/i>: n=2, <i>TP53<\/i>: n=3, <i>PALB2<\/i>: n=7) and WT tumors (n=171). We addressed how the TME differs in mutation carriers versus WT tumors stratified by receptor status. To further investigate immune cell function (cytolytic function, exhaustion, immune checkpoint) as well as pathways involved in immune suppression and\/or promotion, we performed scRNA sequencing using isolated single cells from fresh collected BC samples (WT ER: n=3, <i>BRCA2<\/i> ER: n=1, <i>CHEK2<\/i> ER: n=1, <i>VUS <\/i>ER: n=1) and bulk RNA (<i>BRCA1<\/i>: n=17, <i>BRCA2<\/i>: n=9). To determine immune cell (IC) frequency, we analyzed CD45+ cells detectable in each cohort and their co-expression of markers to determine specific phenotypes. Our data suggest that within <i>BRCA<\/i> mutation-associated BC, there are two groups: 1) with increased tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) including CD8+ cytotoxic T cells with high cytolytic function; and 2) with decreased TILs and cytolytic function. The frequency of CD8+ T cells is significantly decreased in breast cancers with <i>BRCA2<\/i> mutations compared to <i>BRCA1<\/i>. Characterizing ER+ <i>CHEK2<\/i> BC reveals T cell exhaustion compared to WT ER+ BC. Furthermore, preliminary scRNA results reveal increased fibroblast markers in ER+ <i>CHEK2<\/i> and ER+ WT compared to ER+ <i>BRCA2<\/i> tumors. Interestingly, cancer associated fibroblast (CAFs) markers (<i>ACTA2, COL1A1, FAP, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, PDPN, THY1<\/i>) as well as TAMs (<i>CCL2, CD163, CD206, CD68, IL10, LOX, PLOD2, SIGLEC1<\/i>) are increased in ER+ CHEK2 tumors compared to ER+ WT. These data could provide insights into how the TME associated with ER+ <i>CHEK2<\/i> mutations might be driven by CAFs and TAMs with a frequency much higher than in ER+ WT.<i> <\/i>The detection of immune suppressive (Treg, M2) and immune promotive (M1) phenotypes differs in <i>BRCA1<\/i> compared to <i>BRCA2<\/i> mutated and WT TNBC. Our findings could decipher the role of DNA repair gene mutations and their effect on cells within the TME that might influence the design of treatment options in patients with inherited mutations based on their receptor status.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Single cell,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dana Pueschl<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Derek A.

They are present in the tumors of ~15% of Caucasian patients and in up to 50% of Asian patients. Notch3 is a member of a family of transmembrane receptors that has been shown to increase cell proliferation and inhibit cell death and differentiation. Notch3 also promotes the formation of cancer cells with stem-like properties. Studies have shown that a high level of Notch3 in tumors is associated with poor prognosis of patients with NSCLC. However, its role in EGFR-mutant NSCLC tumorigenesis has not been specifically evaluated. We analyzed the TCGA, Moffit, and ORIEN datasets, which include tumor samples from patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer. We found that high levels of Notch3 were associated with decreased overall survival (HR=2.0, p=0.04). Interestingly, analysis of two additional datasets derived from the phase 3 clinical trials OAK and POPLAR showed that patients whose EGFR-mutant tumors had the highest levels of Notch3 had worse clinical outcomes when treated with immunotherapy (HR 18.6, p=4e-04) but not chemotherapy. This could suggest that Notch3 promotes EGFR-mutant lung tumorigenesis by creating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). To test this, we generated a novel mouse model, c\/EGFR<sup>L858R<\/sup>Notch3, that expresses tetracycline-inducible Notch3 and mutant EGFR under the control of the Clara cell-secretory protein (CCSP) promoter. CT-based imaging showed that mice whose tumors harbored high levels of Notch3 had significantly increased lung tumor burden at eight weeks. These mice also had worse overall survival (HR 2.3, p=0.04). To determine if increased Notch3 expression in tumors promotes a more immunosuppressive TME, we did immunophenotyping analysis that revealed a significant increase in regulatory T cells and a decrease in cytotoxic CD8+T cells. Furthermore, T cells in the TME expressed higher levels of markers of exhaustion, specifically, PD-1 and Tim-3. We also found that mice whose tumors had high levels of Notch3 had a greater density of immunosuppressive macrophages in the TME, which was associated with elevated levels of TNF-&#945;. Overall, our data suggest that patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC whose tumors harbor high levels of Notch3 may have worse clinical outcomes and response to immune checkpoint inhibitors due to Notch3 promoting an immunosuppressive TME.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,NSCLC,Notch,Immunosuppression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shankar Suman<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jacob Kaufman<sup><\/sup>, Rajeswara Arasada<sup><\/sup>, Sanjay Varikuti<sup><\/sup>, Nastaran Navari<sup><\/sup>, Shuxiao Guan<sup><\/sup>, Joseph Amann<sup><\/sup>, Mikhail Dikov<sup><\/sup>, David Carbone<sup><\/sup>, Regan Memmott<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4f5e1f4b-2ada-455c-be5f-6ef3c7d862be","ControlNumber":"7124","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

However, the tumor-immune microenvironment in early stage lung tumors and lymph nodes (LNs) have not been fully described. We aim to compare cell states in the immune microenvironments between lung tumors and LNs through multi-modal profiling of the transcriptome and surface proteins.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Needle biopsy samples were taken from 10 treatment-naive early stage lung cancer patients undergoing lung cancer resections. Tissues were obtained from normal lung, lung tumor, and multiple mediastinal LNs, and processed for scRNA-seq including labeling with Total-Seq C CITE-seq panel to quantify the levels of 130 cell surface proteins. In total, 76,721 cells (4,462 normal lung; 39,019 tumor; 33,240 LN) were identified with a median of 1,673 genes and 92 protein features detected per cell. Protein expression was decontaminated through the decontX algorithm. Weighted-Nearest Neighbor analysis from the <i>Seurat<\/i> R package was applied to integrate the CITE-seq and RNA-seq level data for clustering cells into subpopulations.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Six broad cell populations were identified including T\/NK, myeloid (CD14+), B (CD19+), mast (TPSAB1+), pDC (IRF8+), and epithelial (EPCAM+) cells. Among 8 CD4+ T lymphocyte subpopulations and 11 CD8+ T lymphocyte subpopulations observed through clustering, a na&#239;ve CD4+ and a CD8+ T subpopulation (LEF1+, TCF7+) was observed respectively. These na&#239;ve T lymphocyte populations displayed increased proportions in LNs in comparison to tumors. In addition, 5 of the 8 observed CD4+ T lymphocyte populations were enriched in LNs. Immune populations enriched in LNs were largely shared and uniform across different patients. In contrast, a single CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte subpopulation displayed expression of T lymphocyte exhaustion markers (TIGIT+, LAG3+, PD-1+) and were enriched in tumors. 6 of the 11 observed CD8+ T lymphocyte populations were enriched in tumor samples in comparison to LNs. Two alveolar macrophage populations (MARCO+) were enriched in normal lung tissue, in which one showed a heightened stress response.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Single-cell profiling reveals diversity in immune cell populations between LNs, tumor, and adjacent normal tissue in early-stage LUAD. The results suggest the composition of immune cell type is fairly consistent across LNs but more heterogeneous in the tumor and adjacent normal tissue in early-stage patients. In the future, we aim to determine if these immune subpopulations are associated with survival, recurrence, aggressiveness, and predict responses for neoadjuvant treatments, which could improve prognosis and patient quality of life.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Single cell,Multiomics,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zhanhao Xi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yusuke Koga<sup>1<\/sup>, Shannon McDermott<sup>2<\/sup>, Jennifer Beane<sup>1<\/sup>, Sarah  A.

Recognizing the distinct features and capabilities of the cells that compose these tissues is critical. Unfortunately, the complexity of tissues often hinders our ability to distinguish between neighboring cell types and, in turn, scrutinize their transcriptomes and generate reliable and tractable cell models for studying their inherently different biologies. A lack of comprehensive methods to identify, isolate, and culture each cell type from many tissues have impeded progress. Here, we will describe such a method for the breadth of cell types composing the human breast. Furthermore, we have sequenced mRNAs from each purified population and investigated transcriptional patterns that reveal their distinguishing features. These analyses have exposed differentially expressed genes and enriched biological pathways that capture the essence of each cell type, along with transcripts that display intriguing expression patterns. These data, analytic tools, and transcriptional analyses form a rich resource whose exploration provides remarkable insights into the inner workings of the cell types composing the breast, thus furthering our understanding of the rules governing normal cell and tissue function.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast,Heterogeneity,Microenvironment,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Katelyn Del Toro<sup>1<\/sup>, Rosalyn W.

Tremendous heterogeneity has been revealed for tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in different cancer types, however, how these TAM subtypes are localized and interact with tissue ecosystems remains poorly understood. Here, we perform an integrative analysis of TAMs, malignant and non-malignant cells from 10 cancer types, based on single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic data. By interrogating the spatial distributions of different TAM subtypes in situ, we reveal spatially restricted developmental, regulation, and functional heterogeneity of TAMs in TME. Different cancer types show distinct TAM subtype enrichments with specific interface architectures, which is potentially shaped by the cellular compositions and spatial niches of tumor cells. Furthermore, the compartmentalized TAM subpopulations can reflect the spatial architecture of surrounding stromal and immune cells, and thus orchestrate tumor immunity and therapeutic response. Our study demonstrates the cellular and molecular underpinnings of TAM heterogeneity and stochastic regulations of TAMs for TME architecture, tumor progression and immunotherapy responses, which will assist in the identification of possible therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,Tumor microenvironment,Immunotherapy,Spatial transcriptome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yuanyuan Zhang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Fuduan Peng<sup><\/sup>, Guangsheng Pei<sup><\/sup>, Yunhe Liu<sup><\/sup>, Guangchun Han<sup><\/sup>, Linghua Wang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ec810e3b-0f3c-4010-a96a-8de541e29ad3","ControlNumber":"7321","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

One of these models, ID8-luc, is established intraperitoneally with disease progression resulting in the accumulation of ascites fluid. Treatment efficacy can be determined by non-invasive bioluminescence imaging (BLI), but solid ID8-luc tumors do not form in the peritoneal cavity, making assessment of immunomodulation challenging. To this end, we have developed the ID8-luc model as a tool to investigate immuno-modulatory drug candidates by utilizing tissues in the peritoneal cavity of diseased animals for ex vivo analyses. Specifically, flow cytometry of diseased ovaries was employed to examine the effects of checkpoint inhibition on T cell phenotypes and NK cell infiltration. To identify tumor deposits in organs from mice bearing ID8-luc disease for analysis tumor infiltrate, the model was established in untreated C57BL\/6 albino mice, and ovaries, liver, peritoneal wall, pancreas, and spleen were evaluated pathologically. Progressive establishment of tumor deposits were seen in the ovaries, pancreas, and peritoneal wall of untreated mice, but not in na&#239;ve mice. Further, immune infiltration in ovaries were markedly higher compared to na&#239;ve mice. To assess immunomodulation, disease was established in a second cohort of mice, and mice were treated with anti-mPD-1, anti-mPD-L1, and anti-mCTLA-4. Disease progression was monitored by BLI, and following treatment, ovaries containing tumor deposits were collected and lymphoid infiltrate was analyzed by flow cytometry. Checkpoint blockade did not result in efficacy under the conditions tested. However, differences in T cell infiltration were notable with treatment of anti-PD-1 and anti-mPD-L1. Particularly, a marked increase of five to ten fold CD8+ and CD4+ T cells by absolute counts was seen with anti-mPD-1 and anti-mPD-L1 treatment compared to control. Further, the percentage of CD8+ T cells expressing the activation markers CD69 and ICOS as well as PD-1, TIM-3, and LAG-3 checkpoint proteins increased with anti-mPD-1 treatment. Less prominent yet similar trends in this biomarker expression were seen with anti-mPD-L1 treatment. NK and NKT infiltration also increased five to eight fold in ovaries following anti-mPD-1 treatment. Interestingly, anti-mCTLA-4 treatment did not result in any remarkable changes in infiltration or activation marker dynamics. Taken together, these findings are suggestive of a mounting immune response following PD-1 and PD-L1 blockade, but not CTLA-4 blockade, characterized by changes in the lymphocyte compartment in the ovaries. This response is seen in the absence of efficacy, suggesting the potential that this immunomodulation can be exploited in rational combination strategies with checkpoint blockade for immune-oncology drug candidates using the ID8-luc ovarian tumor model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Tumor microenvironment,Mouse models,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sheri Barnes<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Anita Zaitouna<sup><\/sup>, Lauren Kucharczyk<sup><\/sup>, Scott Wise<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Laboratory Corporation of America, Ann Arbor, MI","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a90fa739-4153-48a4-8613-9202c98305e7","ControlNumber":"6943","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Of the four class I PI3K isoforms, PI3K&#945;,&#946;,&#948;,&#947;, the PI3K&#947; isoform is primarily expressed by myeloid cells. Studies from the Varner lab have established that the macrophage lipid kinase, PI3K&#947;, selectively promotes myeloid cell trafficking and immune suppressive transcription in tumor associated monocytes and macrophages, thereby inhibiting T cell recruitment, activation, and tumor eradication. We hypothesized that antagonism or deletion of PI3K&#947; would induce tumor growth inhibition <i>in vivo<\/i> in prostate cancer (PCa) models. To test our hypothesis, we implanted syngeneic murine prostate cancer tumors (B6CaP) into global PI3K&#947; knock out mice and preliminary studies show severe tumor growth inhibition. Using a publicly available single cell RNA sequencing database of metastatic PCa (mPCa) tumors from bone, we calculated regulon scores for transcription factors C\/EBP&#946; and NF&#954;B which are up and down-regulated by PI3K&#947; signaling in myeloid cells respectively. This analysis indicated that a notable proportion of monocytes in mPCa have active PI3K&#947; signaling based on C\/EBP&#946; activity and a lack of NF&#954;B activity. Finally, we tested the significance of eganelisib treatment on monocytes and found that this pathway was essential for monocyte survival during macrophage differentiation and adhesion. Altogether, our proposed research delineates the mechanistic roles of PI3K&#947; in the regulation of prostate cancer tumor growth and support PI3K&#947; as a target to sensitize PCa to immune checkpoint inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,PI3K,Macrophages,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kenneth  M.

Deconvolutional methods allow for scoring of various immune cell types in bulk tumor RNA as a quantification of immune phenotype. Understanding how immune phenotype relates to clinical outcome remains limited. Here, we demonstrate an approach applying topological data analysis to investigate differences of immune phenotype in a pan-cancer cohort (TCGA; n=11,373 tumors). We first define an Immune Activation Score based on relative abundance of activator and suppressor immune cell types and find this score depends on cancer type and distinguishes overall survival outcomes. We then implement a robust Mapper-based algorithm to delineate clusters of immune phenotypes of tumor samples across pan-cancer and within cancer types. Our method identifies immune-activated and immune-suppressed phenotypes with distinct survival outcomes and molecular features.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Immune phenotype,Topological data analysis,Molecular subtypes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kevin  A.

The spatial arrangement of these cells and their co-expression patterns serve as an increasingly important tool for the identification of a novel class of highly predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy response knows as spatial signatures. To study the complex biological processes within the TME and develop clinically useful spatial signatures, it is imperative to take an approach that combines relevant content with flexibility, speed, and throughput. We recently introduced PhenoCode<sup>TM<\/sup> Signature Panels that offer researchers the ability to stain for multiple biomarkers including their marker of choice at a single cell resolution on a single tissue in a scalable end-to-end automated workflow. Incorporating Akoya&#8217;s novel barcoded antibody labeling chemistry, these panels enable all primary antibodies to be applied as a cocktail in a single incubation step, followed by the sequential amplified detection of each marker via Opal fluorescent dye technology. Previously, we have presented data on 3 panels that address key questions for the characterization of the TME, including whether the tumor is &#8220;hot&#8221; or &#8220;cold,&#8221; the identity of the immune cells comprising the TME, the proliferative state of tumor cells and the activation state of the immune cells. Here we showcase two new PhenoCode Signature panels that allow researchers to further characterize the TME by examining immune cell exhaustion and macrophage polarization, key events that contribute to an immunosuppressive TME. In this study, staining was performed using all five PhenoCode Signature panels and DAB on the Leica BOND RX<sup>TM<\/sup> automated stainer. Human formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) lung cancer tissues were stained and whole slide multispectral scans were acquired on the PhenoImager HT&#174; platform. Image analysis was performed with a phenotyping algorithm in inForm&#174; and staining intensities were analyzed in R using Phenoptr and PhenoptrReports. The fluorescent staining of each marker was benchmarked to the DAB staining. Each panel was proven to be both highly accurate and reproducible. Together these five PhenoCode Signature panels provide researchers a rapid and robust method for characterizing the TME to aid the development of spatial signatures which have been shown to be highly effective at predicting therapeutic outcomes.&nbsp;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Tumor microenvironment,Spatial Biology,Multiplexed Immunofluorescence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jacob Circelli<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Rachel Schaefer<sup><\/sup>, Oscar Perez<sup><\/sup>, Linying Liu<sup><\/sup>, Michael McLane<sup><\/sup>, Yi Zheng<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Akoya Biosciences, Marlborough, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8b55b8bb-a3e1-40b0-b5d9-e0efd7a68ca0","ControlNumber":"7570","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

Its poor overall survival emphasizes the need of alternative treatments. ONC201, an imipiridone small molecule, and the oncolytic virus Delta-24-RGD have shown safety and effectiveness in preclinical and clinical settings for these diseases. In this work, we set to characterize the antitumor effect of these two agents combined for the treatment of pHGGs and DMGs.<br \/><u>Experimental procedures:<\/u> A panel of human pHGG (CHLA-03-AA, SF188, SJ-GBM2), DMG (SU-DIPG IV, SF8628, TP-54, HSJD-DIPG-007, UMPED83), and murine DMG cell lines (XFM, NP-53) were used. We assessed viral replication by hexon titration, protein expression by immunoblotting\/immunohistochemistry, and oxygen consumption by Seahorse analyses. Viability was measured by MTS. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were measured by qPCR. CHLA-03-AA\/XFM were orthotopically engrafted in athymic nude\/Balb\/c mice. For <i>in vivo <\/i>experiments, animals were treated with PBS\/Delta-24-RGD (10<sup>7<\/sup> pfu\/mice) intratumorally, followed by ONC201 oral gavage administration (125 mg\/kg\/twice\/weekly). The tumor microenvironment immune infiltration was evaluated by flow cytometry.<br \/><u>Results:<\/u> We checked the potential negative interaction between both agents <i>in vitro<\/i>. Adenovirus replication was not affected by ONC201 cotreatment, indicating the suitability of this combination. <i>In vitro<\/i> citotoxycity analyses showed the cotreatment is either synergistic or additive in 80% of the cells evaluated. Then, we set to characterize the mechanistic effects of the combination. Analysis of mitochondria status showed the decrease in oxygen consumption previously reported as ONC201 effect is maintained with Delta-24-RGD presence. Confirmation of higher mitochondria damage was assessed by a reduction of mtDNA in the combination. Independently, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) previously described in both agents was found potentiated in cotreatment via ATF4. Altogether, these data suggest an improved response in the combination by mitochondria and ERS perturbation. <i>In vivo<\/i>, cotreatment led to a significant increase in the median OS (Control: 48 days; ONC201: 54.5 days; Delta-24-RGD: 62 days; Delta-24-RGD\/ONC201: 95 days (P=0.0008)) in CHLA-03-AA bearing mice, leading to 20% long-term survivors, free of disease.
