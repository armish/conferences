[{"Abstract":"ICVB-1042 is a novel E2F transcription factor-dependent oncolytic virus (OV) demonstrated to confer tumor selective replication, enhanced potency and tumor tropism. The lytic efficiency of ICVB-1042 was assessed in human primary dissociated tumor cells (DTCs) from bladder, breast, and glioblastoma (GBM) tumors and compared against indication specific OVs. Primary DTCs were analyzed on xCELLigence eSight instrument for simultaneous imaging and viability monitoring. ICVB-1042 and comparator OVs were added at multiplicities of infection (MOI) ranging from 1.2 - 30; plates were cultured for 10 days. Cell index measurements quantified viability. Imaging for a viral-encoded reporter gene (YPet) expression quantified viral infection. Supernatant from infected samples was analyzed by ddPCR to quantify viral genome replication. Efficacy of ICVB-1042 was assessed in a PDX model of subcutaneous GBM in Nude mice, with intratumoral administration of ICVB-1042 every 3 days for 3 doses. Table 1 reports cytolysis data. Bladder: ICVB-1042 infection showed complete lysis at MOI 30 and impressive lysis at lower MOIs. Comparator showed high levels of lysis only at MOI 30. Breast: ICVB-1042 showed efficient lysis at all MOIs; comparator did not reach &#62;10% lysis in either donor. GBM: ICVB-1042 and comparator had similar lysis at MOI 30; ICVB-1042 showed efficient lysis at lower MOI. YPet imaging indicated ICVB-1042 infection spread more rapidly than comparators. ICVB-1042 produced more viral genomes via replication than comparators, particularly at high MOIs. ICVB-1042 showed significant tumor growth inhibition and increased overall survival compared to vehicle-treated animals. ICVB-1042 infection, replication, and cytolysis were evident across all diverse primary patient tumor types and multiple donor genotypes, with superior cytolysis compared to other indication specific OVs. ICVB-1042 maintains potent activity in vivo in patient GBM DCTs.<br\/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{AF9DF47E-FE57-4495-BBF5-FCD8C245F912}\"><caption>Table 1 - Percentage OV-Mediated Cytolysis of Primary Human DTCs by Indication, Donor, and MOI<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Indication<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\"><b> Bladder<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\"><b> Breast<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\"><b> GBM<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Donor<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>MOI<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>ICVB-1042<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Comparator OV-1<\/b> <b>(E1A promoter swap for tumor selectivity;

Resistance to AR targeting agents most often develops through overexpression of AR and expression of truncated, constitutively active RNA splice variants of AR. While clinical use of PD-1\/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade has failed to demonstrate clinical success in treating resistance prostate cancers, the slower progression of prostate cancer provides an opportunity for immune targeted interventions. Cancer specific vaccines have the potential to enable and enhance tumor specific immune responses by stimulating and directing T cell immunity to important oncologic targets. We hypothesized that a cancer vaccine designed to induce a T cell response against cells expressing high levels of AR would result in an anti-tumor effect and potentially prevent or delay the development of therapeutic resistance.<br \/>Methods: To evaluate AR and AR variants as potential immunological targets, we produced adenoviral vaccines against AR (Ad-AR) or AR splice variant 7 (Ad-AR-V7). We vaccinated na&#239;ve mice and examined AR and AR variant specific immunity in peptide restimulation. We further tested our vaccines in prophylactic and therapeutic regimens using multiple subcutaneous syngeneic tumor models (including prostate tumor lines, such as TrampC2) which were engineered to express AR or AR-V7.<br \/>Results: Adenoviral vaccines targeting AR or AR-V7 produced robust T-cell responses against the N-terminal domain of AR. Notably, vaccination with both Ad-AR or Ad-AR-V7 induced significant anti-tumor immune responses, inducing complete tumor clearance against tumors expressing AR-V7 and allowing for long-term survival in the majority of vaccinated mice.<br \/>Conclusions: These data demonstrate the potential of AR and AR splice variants as immunologic targets of prostate cancer vaccines, which elicit AR specific T cell immunity and produce anti-tumor responses in prostate cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vaccines,Immunotherapy,Prostate cancer,Androgen receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Robert  D.

We sought to harness gene-modified tumor cells as a vaccine platform and developed cancer vaccines composed of breast cancer cells expressing GM-CSF (SV-BR-1-GM). We have recently reported favorable clinical outcomes in patient populations that match SV-BR-1-GM at one or more HLA alleles. Mechanistically, SV-BR-1-GM cells can directly activate CD4+ T-cells in an antigen-specific HLA-restricted manner, as demonstrated by an in vitro antigen presentation assay (1). All these observations led us to hypothesize that semi-allogeneic cell-based cancer vaccines (partially matching host HLA genotype) would mount an enhanced immune response by forcing the host immune response to recognize tumor-associated antigens in the context of allogeneic HLA-I or II molecules or in proximity of strong non-self-antigens. Therefore, steps were taken to generate semi-allogeneic cancer cell lines expressing an extended repertoire of stimulatory molecules to induce optimal immune activation (Bria-OTS).<br \/><b><u>Methods:<\/u><\/b><u> <\/u>SV-BR-1 (Breast cancer), PC-3 (prostate cancer), SK-MEL-24 (Melanoma), and NCI-H2228 (Lung cancer) were selected for vaccine development.

We transduced selected co-stimulatory molecules and immune-modulatory cytokines. Next, the unique combinations of HLA-A and HLA-DRB3\/4\/5 alleles were transduced into the cells using lentiviral based vectors. Finally, functionality of the engineered cells was validated by using molecular and cellular based assays.<br \/><b><u>Preliminary data:<\/u><\/b><u> <\/u>Four cell lines (for each tumor type) that secreted GM-CSF, IFN&#945;, IL12, IL7 and expressed CD80, CD86, 4-1BBL, and different combinations of both Class I and Class II HLA alleles were selected. Using cell-based assays - including mixed lymphocyte reaction assays -, we demonstrated that the generated cells stimulate na&#239;ve T-cells.

Thus, delaying recurrence of disease is a high unmet need in ovarian cancer. Combining the chemotherapy regime with immunostimulatory gene therapy utilizing oncolytic viruses as gene vehicles is an attractive treatment option targeting alternative pathways to induce tumor cell death, control tumor growth and prevent development of metastasis. LOAd703 is an oncolytic adenovirus derived from the LOAd platform of replication-restricted Ad5\/35 adenoviruses. LOAd703 encodes for the human immunostimulatory genes trimerized, membrane-bound CD40L (TMZ-CD40L) and 4-1BBL, expressed under a CMV promotor which enables gene expression in both tumor cells and tumor stroma while replication is restricted to tumor cells. Herein, we investigated the effect of combining LOAd703 with paclitaxel and cisplatin in vitro and in vivo. Four human ovarian cancer cell lines (CAOV3, COV362, OVCAR3 and PEA2) were treated with LOAd703 alone, in combination with paclitaxel and\/or cisplatin or were left untreated. LOAd703 efficiently killed the ovarian cancer cell lines by oncolysis, as evaluated by an MTS cell viability assay. This effect was further improved when LOAd703 was given in combination with paclitaxel and\/or cisplatin. Flow cytometry revealed that the ability of LOAd703 to induce expression of the immunostimulatory transgenes TMZ-CD40L and 4-1BBL, was not negatively affected by the combination with paclitaxel and\/or cisplatin. The combination treatment was further tested in an in vivo model where BALB\/c nu\/nu mice were xenografted with 5 million OVCAR3 cells. The mice were subsequently treated with LOAd703 (1x10e9 FFU\/mouse), both alone as well as in combination with paclitaxel (6mg\/kg) and cisplatin (2.5mg\/mg). The treatments were given over the course of 4 weeks where LOAd703 was administered intratumorally twice per week while chemotherapy was given intraperitoneally once per week. The results showed that the combination of LOAd703 and the chemotherapeutics controlled tumor growth significantly better than either LOAd703 alone or the standard treatment with paclitaxel and cisplatin. In conclusion, LOAd703 efficiently killed ovarian cancer cell lines in vitro, and could potentiate the effect of standard-of-care chemotherapy. This effect was confirmed in vivo, in which the combination therapy had a better tumor control than the other treatment groups. A clinical trial is ongoing to confirm the effect of adding LOAd703 to different treatment regimes in ovarian cancer (NCT03225989).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic adenovirus,Immunotherapy,Chemotherapy,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Sedigheh Naseri<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Jonas Härdin<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Emma Eriksson<sup>1<\/sup>, Tanja Lövgren<sup>1<\/sup>, Gustav Ullenhag<sup>2<\/sup>, Angelica Loskog<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Uppsala University, Dept of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala, Sweden,<sup>2<\/sup>Uppsala University Hospital, Department of Oncology, Uppsala, Sweden","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"78c35f46-451d-4b9f-8343-3b1e64150390","ControlNumber":"6270","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

We show here that ES2B-C001 effectively inhibits mammary carcinoma growth and metastasis in a transgenic mouse model expressing activated human HER-2. ES2B-C001 vaccine is a tag\/catcher conjugation system: Acinectobacter phage 205 (AP205) capsid VLP, each with 180 tag peptides, are conjugated with catcher-HER-2 extracellular domain. The vaccine was administered alone, thanks to the intrinsic adjuvanticity of the VLP, or with Montanide ISA 51. QD is a HER-2-positive cell line established from a mammary carcinoma of a Delta16 (FVB background) transgenic mouse, bearing the human HER-2 splice variant Delta16. FVB female mice were challenged in the mammary fat pad with 1 million QD cells; vaccinations started 2 weeks after cell challenge and were repeated every 2 weeks. Untreated mice developed progressive tumors within one month, whereas 70% of mice vaccinated without adjuvant and all mice vaccinated with adjuvant were still tumor-free one year after cell challenge. Mice challenged intravenously (i.v.) developed more than 300 lung metastases, whereas all vaccinated mice remained metastasis-free. Delta16 transgenic mice are immunologically tolerant to human HER-2 and develop aggressive mammary carcinomas with a median latency of 5 months. Vaccination of young, tumor-free Delta16 mice completely prevented tumor onset for more than one year. Delta16 mice challenged i.v. with QD cells mice developed a mean of 68 lung nodules, whereas 73% of mice therapeutically vaccinated without adjuvant, and all mice vaccinated with E2SB-C001+ISA 51, were free from metastases. ES2B-C001 induced copious anti-HER-2 antibodies of all IgG subclasses, ranging 1-10 mg\/mL in FVB mice and 0.1-1 mg\/mL in Delta16 mice; antibody titers remained very high for 6-10 months after the last vaccination. Antibodies inhibited the 3D growth of human HER-2+++ and HER-2++ breast cancer cells, of trastuzumab resistant cells and of gastric carcinoma cells. Vaccination increased interferon-gamma secreting cells in the spleen, as evaluated by ELISPot (21&#177;3 spots\/2x10<sup>5<\/sup> cells). The results warrant further development of ES2B-C001 for the therapy of HER-2 positive human breast cancer and of other tumors expressing HER-2.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HER2,Vaccines,Virus-like particle (VLP),Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Francesca Ruzzi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Arianna Palladini<sup>2<\/sup>, Stine Clemmensen<sup>3<\/sup>, Annette Strobaek<sup>3<\/sup>, Nicolaas Buijs<sup>3<\/sup>, Tanja Domeyer<sup>3<\/sup>, Jerzy Dorosz<sup>3<\/sup>, Vladislav Soroka<sup>3<\/sup>, Dagmara Grzadziela<sup>3<\/sup>, Christina Jo Rasmussen<sup>3<\/sup>, Ida Busch Nielsen<sup>3<\/sup>, Max Soegaard<sup>3<\/sup>, Maria Sofia Semprini<sup>1<\/sup>, Laura Scalambra<sup>1<\/sup>, Stefania Angelicola<sup>1<\/sup>, Lorena Landuzzi<sup>4<\/sup>, Pier-Luigi Lollini<sup>1<\/sup>, Mette Thorn<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy,<sup>3<\/sup>ExpreS2ion Biotechnologies, Copenhagen, Denmark,<sup>4<\/sup>Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9732f2bb-aa37-4603-8bb0-5870e294e86a","ControlNumber":"2027","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

The platform is based on Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), which has several ideal properties (highly oncolytic, non-pathogenic, small genome that&#8217;s well understood and easily modified). Here we present the development of HG001, our first therapy for the treatment of liver cancer.<br \/>Methods: Genome design of HG001 was completed using our proprietary software. The virus was designed with a GPC3 targeting glycoprotein and a genetic ON-switch (aptazyme) with a liver cancer specific aptamer. DNA fragments were synthesized and then assembled to construct the complete viral genome of HG001. Virus was rescued in BHK-21 using reverse genetics and then verified by nanopore sequencing. We evaluated efficacy and safety in cancer- (Huh-7, SNU-449) and healthy- (NIH\/3T3) cells. VSV wildtype was used as a control virus. IncuCyte live cell imaging and analysis software was used to quantify efficacy and safety. Cell counts and cell area per well (&#181;m2\/well) were measured to evaluate cell health and proliferation. Apoptosis was determined using Annexin V. Student&#8217;s t-test was used to assess statistical significance.<br \/>Results: Our platform enabled us to complete the process from assembly of the fragments to the start of testing of HG001 in under 2 weeks. To determine selectivity and efficacy, we evaluated serial dilutions in Huh7 (high expression of GPC3) and SNU-449 cells (GPC3 negative). Real time monitoring of HG001 showed cell killing in Huh7 cells at MOI=1 (p&#60;0.001) and cytopathic effects (CPE) in MOI=0.1. However, no impact on cell proliferation and viability was found in SNU-449 (p=ns), indicating specificity for the target receptor. To further validate selectivity and demonstrate safety, we assayed normal NIH\/3T3 cells with the same titers. We did not observe any indication of cytotoxicity, and kinetic data of cell growth revealed no significant difference between HG001 and mock infection (p=ns). In stark contrast, VSV-WT induced rapid lysis in NIH\/3T3 cells at MOI=0.01 (p&#60;0.01). Taken together, HG001 exhibits at least 2 orders of magnitude improvement in safety. Apoptosis assays conducted in these cell lines corroborated these findings. HG001 was well tolerated and showed no adverse effects during initial in vivo studies. Current in vivo studies are ongoing to confirm efficacy.<br \/>Conclusion: We have shown that a rationally designed synthetic virus can be made efficiently with high specificity and efficacy. Initial testing is showing high promise for future in vivo testing. With further iterations we hope to develop a strong therapeutic for liver cancer. Going forward, we are actively looking for collaborations with oncology centers on other types of cancer we could target using our platform.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic virus,Liver cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chad Moles<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Rupsa Basu<sup><\/sup>, Taylor Flaat<sup><\/sup>, Christopher Collado<sup><\/sup>, Peter Weijmarshausen<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Humane Genomics, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9e6ab68b-5804-474a-8f46-b5ce72ece592","ControlNumber":"8170","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;C.

We have previously demonstrated that CodaLytic, a codon-modified influenza virus, can kickstart the cancer immunity cycle at various steps in several mouse models with differing baseline immune contextures. Here, we are confirming the mechanisms of action of the virus in combination with immune checkpoint inhibition in murine and human preclinical models. Efficacy after intratumoral injection of 10<sup>8<\/sup> PFU CodaLytic in combination with &#945;PD-1 and\/or &#945;CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade was determined in &#945;PD-1-resistant B16-F10 melanoma and 4T1 triple-negative breast cancer mouse models. Changes in the tumor immune infiltrate after treatment were characterized using flow cytometry. Primary human tumoroids were incubated with CodaLytic +\/- 10 &#956;g\/ml pembrolizumab using the 3D-Explore platform by Nilogen Oncosystems. Tumor cell killing (TCK) was detected by high-content imaging at 72h and effects on the TME were characterized by cytokine release and RNA sequencing at 24h and\/or 48h. In B16-F10, addition of CodaLytic to &#945;PD-1 blockade rescued non-significant tumor growth inhibition (TGI) with &#945;PD-1 alone, achieving 86% TGI (p &#60; 0.01), 40% complete regressions and 60% survival beyond 45 days (69% TGI, 20% regressions and 30% long-term survival after CodaLytic monotherapy). Mechanistically, CodaLytic-containing regimens increased tumor immune infiltration, in particular with CD8+ T cells and cross-presenting dendritic cells (DCs). 4T1 tumors did not significantly respond to &#945;PD-1, &#945;CTLA-4 or CodaLytic monotherapies, but achieved 86% TGI in combination with 50% long-term survival past 55 days. CTLA-4 blockade emerged as the initial driver of slowed tumor growth and &#945;PD-1 drove long-term survival, which was further augmented by CodaLytic addition. Infiltration with CD45+ leukocytes and cross-presenting DCs correlated with tumor volumes. The benefit of CodaLytic combination treatment was also demonstrated <i>ex vivo<\/i> in human tumoroid cultures. Meaningful TCK was observed in 50% of specimens vs 17% with pembrolizumab and 33% with CodaLytic alone. In this system without immune cell recruitment from a systemic reservoir, sustained release of CXCL9 and CXCL10 and temporal decreases of MIP-1&#946; and CCL2 associated with response. Additional transcriptional analyses are ongoing. Taken together, this and additional preclinical data confirms the emergence of CodaLytic as a potent immunostimulatory agent capable of restoring immune cell infiltration and anti-tumor efficacy when used in combination with checkpoint inhibition in PD-1 resistant models. This data supports future development of CodaLytic for immuno-virotherapy of tumor types in which checkpoint therapy is less established.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic virus,Virotherapy,PD-1 resistance,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yiwen Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, Nusrat Jahan<sup>1<\/sup>, Marcin Stawowczyk<sup>2<\/sup>, Katie Pfeffer<sup>2<\/sup>, Juliana Tafrova<sup>2<\/sup>, James Rodriguez<sup>2<\/sup>, Chen Yang<sup>2<\/sup>, Sybil  A.

Antigen processing and presentation is a complex, multistep process that can be significantly enhanced via antigen modification, leading to better antigen-specific immune responses. Using mRNA, we can express exogenous antigens inside the cell and facilitate the subcellular localization of these antigens to enhance antigen processing and presentation. In this work, we introduced endolysosomal trafficking domains from CD1d molecules to drive subcellular localization of antigenic proteins to the late endosomes (LE) to enhance class I and class II antigen loading. CD1d are molecules that naturally traffic between the membrane and the late endosomes, where antigens are processed and loaded to both class II and class I molecules in a TAP-independent manner. We compared the immunogenicity of a novel endolysosomal trafficking domain, human CD1d, coupled to a chimeric HPV16 E6 and E7 (HPV16E6E7-hCD1d) antigen to antigen designs intended to be either a) secreted (Sec-HPV16E6E7), b) retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by an ER retention signal KDEL (HPV16E6E7-KDEL) or c) unmodified antigen sequence (HPV16E6E7). To ensure intracellular translation and expression, all antigens were encoded and delivered as mRNAs. The immunogenicity of each antigen design was assessed in HPV16 positive cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) donor derived PBMCs and healthy controls. Using confocal microscopy, we observed that the hCD1d trafficking domain directed the translated E6E7 protein into late endosomes, which was not observed for any of the other antigen designs. Importantly, antigen localization to late endosomes resulted in significantly improved immunogenicity in vitro as well as in vivo. We observed a consistent increase in numbers of activated antigen-specific T cells across multiple CIN donor PBMCs treated with HPV16E6E7-hCD1d compared to the other 3 designs, as measured by Interferon gamma secretion, surface marker expression, and T-cell proliferation. To assess the generalizability of this approach, we also compared immunogenicity in human donor PBMCs using the human cytomegalovirus antigen pp65, and observed similar results. Lastly, the immunogenicity of each antigen design was tested in vivo by intramuscular injection of nanoparticle formulated mRNAs in C56\/Bl6 mice, and inclusion of the murine analogue (mCD1d) resulted in significantly increased generation of HPV16-specific T cell responses. Based on these findings, we are developing a novel mRNA-based cancer therapeutic that includes the addition of hCD1d trafficking domain in the HPV16-specific antigen component.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Human papillomavirus (HPV),Vaccines,Antigen presentation,Cervical cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Weiqun Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Daniel Fernandez<sup>2<\/sup>, Colin  J.

Boosting T-lymphocyte mediated responses against GBM offers a promising approach towards solving this problem. Herein, we present a therapeutic vaccination strategy that promotes the phagocytosis of tumor cells, enhances tumor antigen presentation, and induces a tumor-specific adaptive immune response with subsequent tumor eradication. This strategy consists of subcutaneous injection of irradiated whole tumor cells (rWTC) pulsed with phagocytic agonists (Mannan-BAM), TLR ligands (LTA, Poly (I:C), and R-848), and anti-CD40 agonistic antibody (collectively abbreviated as rWTC-MBTA). We evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of rWTC-MBTA strategy in mouse syngeneic GBM tumor models with GL261 and SB28 cells. In GL261 GBM model, complete regression (CR) of intracranial tumors was achieved in 70% (7\/10) of rWTC-MBTA treated animals while none survived in the control group. Of note, the therapeutic efficacy of rWTC-MBTA was abolished in CD4-T and\/or CD8-T lymphocyte depleted mice. Immunophenotyping analyses of peripheral lymph nodes and brain tumors of rWTC-MBTA treated mice demonstrated increased antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells and MHC II+ monocytes) and increased cytotoxic IFN&#947;, TNF&#945;, and granzyme B-secreting CD4-T and CD8-T cells. All three CR mice that were rechallenged with GL261 cells intracranially 14 months after their last rWTC-MBTA treatment resisted tumor development, confirming the establishment of long-term immunological memory. In SB28 GBM model, 80% (8\/10) rWTC-MBTA treated mice survived past 95 days after tumor cell implantation without any GBM-related symptoms, with median survival being only 35 days in control groups. In summary, our study demonstrated that rWTC-MBTA strategy can induce potent adaptive immune response against GBM in pre-clinical models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Vaccines,Preclinical,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Herui Wang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Rogelio Medina<sup>2<\/sup>, Juan Ye<sup>1<\/sup>, Samik Chakraborty<sup>3<\/sup>, Ondrej Uher<sup>4<\/sup>, Mitchell Sun<sup>1<\/sup>, Jan Zenka<sup>5<\/sup>, Mark  R.

HPV-16 E7 antigen is a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) commonly expressed in HPV-induced tumors; however, it has low immunogenicity. The interaction of 4-1BBL with its receptor induces pleiotropic effects on innate, adaptive, and regulatory immunity and, if fused to TAAs in DNA vaccines, can improve the antitumor response; however, there is low transfection and antitumor efficiency. Oncolytic virotherapy is promising for antitumor gene therapy as it can be selectively replicated in tumor cells, inducing cell lysis, and furthermore, tumor cell debris can be taken in by immune cells to potentiate antitumor responses.<br \/>Methods: The AdenoQuick 2.0 system was used to construct three OAds, expressing 1) SP-SA-E7-4-1BBL, 2) SA-E7-4-1BBL or 3) SP-SA-41BBL. The expression of transgenes was confirmed by western blot and subcellular localization of SP-SA-E7-4-1BBL was evaluated by immunofluorescence. The recombinant OAds-mediated cancer killing effect was evaluated by MTT assay and crystal violet staining, The recombinant OAds therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in a C57BL\/6 mice bearing subcutaneous TC-1 lung tumor. Tumor growth and survival were monitored for a period of twenty-eight days.<br \/>Results: In this study, we expressed the immunomodulatory molecule SA-4-1BBL fused to E7 on an oncolytic adenovirus (OAd) system. In vitro infection of TC-1 tumor cells and NIH-3T3 non-tumor cells with SA\/E7\/4-1BBL OAd demonstrated that only tumor cells are selectively destroyed. Moreover, protein expression is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum in both cell lines when a signal peptide (SP) is added. Finally, in an HPV-induced cancer murine model, the therapeutic oncolytic activity of OAd can be detected, and this can be improved when fused to E7 and SP.<br \/>Conclusions: In this study, we report the design of an oncolytic adenovirus expressing the SP\/SA\/E7\/4-1BBL fusion gene, which is capable of infecting murine cancer and normal cells, and the expressed protein was able to be targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. Most importantly, OAd induced a cell killing effect that is specific to cancer cells. Moreover, OAd treatment induced a potent antitumor effect in a mouse TC-1 cancer model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Oncolytic adenovirus,Lung cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jorge G.

However, tumors often suppress DC differentiation and function leaving cancer patients with DC populations that are quantitatively and qualitatively deficient. This limits both the native immune responses to tumors as well as response to cancer therapy including immunotherapy. Thus, provision of healthy and functionally intact DCs to replace and correct the in vivo function offers an interesting therapeutic opportunity. DCs are composed of multiple subsets which specialize in activation of different immune effectors. Thus, a combination of DC subsets could generate a broad and diverse immunity targeted at cancer. To date, several attempts have been made to generate functional human DCs ex vivo for injection to patients, but the DC subtypes most effective in generation of anti-tumor responses&#8212;cDC1 and cDC2s&#8212;have proven difficult to make <i>ex vivo<\/i> using clinically compliant protocols. Here we show that cDC1s and cDC2s can be generated at high yield from hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) from three different HPCs sources (including adult bone marrow) using clinically compliant protocols. We characterize the phenotype and functionality of these cells showing that both cDC1s and cDC2s efficiently process antigens, stimulate, and expand T cells specific for those antigens, and that those T cell populations display targeted killing of tumor cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. The ability to produce these subtypes using clinically compliant protocols is a major step towards developing effective autologous DC therapy for cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Dendritic cells,Vaccine,HSC,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Chun Yu<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Richard  L.

Thanks to its large genome capacity, multiple cloning loci, and availability of different promoters, VACV is an optimal vector for the design of advanced immunotherapies. Payloads with an established clinical efficacy but limited in terms of tolerability require local delivery. We report here the preclinical characterization of TG6050, a VACV encoding single chain interleukin 12 (IL12) and anti-CTLA4, targeting multiple cancer indications.<br \/>Methods: TG6050 was generated by insertion of both the single chain IL-12p70, and an anti-CTLA-4 full-length (heavy and light chains independently) into the thymidine kinase (TK) and ribonucleotide reductase (RR) loci, of a triple deleted (&#916;J2R,&#916;I4L,&#916;M2L) VACV, Copenhagen strain. TG6050 was fully characterized <i>in vitro, i.e. <\/i>replication in tumor and normal cells, transgenes expression, functionality, and genetic stability. Its preclinical surrogate mTG6050, expressing murine payloads, was used to investigate the <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumoral activities in a broad range of immunocompetent murine models, as well as its mode of action in the reprograming of the tumor microenvironment (TME).<br \/>Results: TG6050 displayed the same replicative, oncolytic activity, and genetic stability features as benchmark recombinant vaccinia viruses. IL-12 and anti-CTLA4 were both expressed at high levels, and as functional molecules by a broad panel of reference tumor cell lines. Local administration of mTG6050 induced accumulation of transgenes into tumor, with low systemic exposure. Noteworthy, expression of IL-12 did not accelerate the clearance of the viral vector. The combined effects of viral replication, IL-12 and anti-CTLA4 expression translated into impressive antitumoral activities in several syngeneic tumor models including immune-resistant ones such as B16F10 or LLC1. Transcriptomic analyses of the TG6050-treated tumors demonstrated a strong dynamic of infiltration by innate and adaptive immune cells. IFNy-ELISpot analysis on splenocytes confirmed induction of a strong systemic and specific anti-tumoral immune response. Moreover, the combination of TG6050 with ICI improved tumor regression in several challenging tumor models.<br \/>Conclusion: TG6050 is a novel oncolytic VACV designed for multiple routes of administration, and several tumor indications. Its strong impact on the TME, by massive infiltration of innate and adaptive immune cells, translated into very remarkable therapeutic activities in resistant tumors. This anti-tumor activity was further enhanced by combination with anti-PD-1.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-12,Vaccinia virus,Oncolytic virus,Tumor immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jean-Baptiste Marchand<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Fadi Azar<sup><\/sup>, Christelle Demeusoit<sup><\/sup>, Patricia Kleinpeter<sup><\/sup>, Jules Deforges<sup><\/sup>, Fend Laetitia<sup><\/sup>, Chantal Hoffmann<sup><\/sup>, Huguette Schultz<sup><\/sup>, Nathalie Silvestre<sup><\/sup>, Eric Quéméneur<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Transgene S.A., Illkirch-Graffenstaden Cedex, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a964222c-a84d-40c5-a6a0-c2b471f38615","ControlNumber":"4299","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

Childhood STS accounts for up to 8% of all diagnosed pediatric cancer with rhabdomyosarcoma as the most common form. Prognosis depends on the type, stage and localization of the tumor, with a general 5-year survival of 70% for all STS patients. However, for patients with metastatic disease 5-year survival is 15%. The most common treatment for pediatric STS is surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy, and if possible radiotherapy. Immunotherapy, such as checkpoint blockade inhibitors (CPI), has revolutionized treatment for other malignancies such as melanoma. However, CPIs have shown limited efficacy in STS overall, and even less in pediatric patients. Thus, there is a strong need for new treatment options. Herein, we study a novel immunostimulatory gene therapy based on an oncolytic adenovirus, LOAd703, for efficacy in STS. LOAd703 is currently under clinical evaluation for several other solid cancers. LOAd703 is derived from the LOAd family of serotype 5\/35 adenoviruses dependent on host cell entry via CD46. Modification of E1A has been introduced for selective replication and lysis of tumor cells. Moreover, LOAd703 is armed with the immunostimulatory genes trimerized, membrane-bound (TMZ)-CD40L and 4-1BBL expressed under control of a CMV promoter. A panel of 11 different cell lines from different STS subtypes and from both pediatric and adult patients were shown to express CD46 by flow cytometry before treatment. The cell lines were subsequently infected with LOAd703. CD46 expression was retained after infection and the infected cells upregulated the expression of the transgenes TMZ-CD40L and 4-1BBL. In addition, qPCR analysis confirmed LOAd703 replication in all tested cell lines in a time dependent manner. Replication induced oncolysis of all investigated cell lines, as analyzed by an MTS cell viability assay. In a co-culture system with peripheral blood mononuclear cells and infected sarcoma cells, preliminary results showed an alteration of markers associated with differentiation and activation among both innate and adaptive immune cells, including myeloid cells, NK cells and T cells. In conclusion, LOAd703 demonstrated a high oncolytic capacity and expression of the immunostimulatory transgenes in STS cells. Preliminary data shows that infected STS cells stimulate immune cells via the TMZ-CD40L and 4-1BBL transgenes. More in depth analysis will be performed on co-culture experiments to pinpoint the exact effect on different immune cell compartments.

Our lab has been focus on inducing cellular immunity against HER2<sup>+ <\/sup>BC through vaccination against the tumor-associated antigen HER2. Approximately 20 years ago, we performed an experimental pilot study by administrating HER2 peptide and recombinant protein pulsed dendritic cells (DC vaccine) to six patients with refractory HER2<sup>+<\/sup> advanced or metastatic (stage II (&#8805; 6 +LN), III, or stage IV) BC. We followed the patients on 2019 found that all of the six patients were still alive, 18 years after vaccination. Their blood sample were analyzed with cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) and found there is a significantly increased presence of CD27 expressing memory T cells in response to HER2 peptide stimulation. Recent report on the SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccine also suggested that CD27 expressing memory T cells plays a critical role in long-lasting cellular immunity against SARS-CoV2 infection. Therefore, we hypothesized that CD27 plays a critical role in cellular immunity against BC, and the stimulation of CD27 expressing T cells with mAb targeting CD27 significantly increase the cellular immunity triggered by vaccination against tumor-associated antigen.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We recapitulate the rise of CD27<sup>+<\/sup> antigen specific T cells among the vaccinated patients using a transgenic mouse model expressing human CD27. When combined the adenoviral-vector based HER2 (Ad-HER2) vaccination with a single dose of human aCD27 antibody (Varlilumab), we found there is a robust increase in the HER2 specific T cells compared to vaccination alone, especially CD27<sup>+<\/sup>CD44<sup>+<\/sup> memory CD4 T cells, even after 120 days post vaccination. Using an ICI-insensitive syngeneic HER2<sup>+<\/sup> BC models, we found 50% of mice in the combination group of aCD27 antibody plus Ad-HER2 showed total tumor regression by the end of study. When combined with anti-PD1 antibody, the combination of AdHER2 and Varlilumab leads to total tumor regression in 90% of tumor bearing mice with syngeneic HER2<sup>+<\/sup> BC, indicating that the vaccination against tumor associated antigen HER2 plus anti-CD27 antibody sensitized ICI-insensitive HER2<sup>+<\/sup> BC toward ICI.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our data demonstrates that the administration of anti-CD27 antibody significantly increase the long term presence of CD27<sup>+ <\/sup>antigen specific memory T cells after vaccination against tumor associated antigen HER2. As consequence, combination of anti-CD27 with HER2 sensitized the immune unresponsive breast cancer toward anti-PD1 antibody. Our study suggests that the vaccination against tumor-associated antigen with mAb targeting CD27 leads to the robust cellular immunity, which is required for successful ICIs against breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vaccines,PD-1,HER2,CD27,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Bin-Jin Hwang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Erika Crosby<sup><\/sup>, Timothy Trotter<sup><\/sup>, Li-Chung Tsao<sup><\/sup>, Tao Wang<sup><\/sup>, Xiao Yang<sup><\/sup>, Herbert Kim Lyerly<sup><\/sup>, Zachary Hartman<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Surgery, Duke University, Durham, NC","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6c9bf96a-fe01-4c45-83d1-d626ce7017be","ControlNumber":"6373","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>B.

Over the past years, modified poxviruses were developed to induce a sustained antitumoral immune response. Several studies confirm this hypothesis and report induction of T cell response against the antigen targeted by these vaccines. We previously reported MVA induced T-cell response against HPV oncoviral antigens E6 and E7 in HPV anogenital cancers (NCT03260023) and against private tumor neoantigen in ovarian and head and neck cancer. Despite these promising results the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in vaccine response remains to be elucidated. In this work, we inquired whether EVs, well known for mediating intercellular communication, play a role in these therapeutic vaccination process. We first asked whether poxviral infection of human primary cells modifies their EV secretion properties. To this end, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors were infected with poxviral vectors, cell culture supernatants were harvested, and different isolation methods were compared for their ability to separate EVs from viral particles: ultracentrifugation, immunocapture, density gradient, velocity gradient, size exclusion chromatography and filtration. EVs size distribution and concentration were determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and the presence of infectious viral particles was titrated by plaque assays. Our data showed that 0.1&#181;m filtration allowed the complete separation of EVs from infectious viral particles. All other methods showed co-isolation of EVs and infectious viral particles. Using this method, we demonstrate that infection of PBMCs with the poxviruses VACV, MVA and PCPV significantly increased the amount of secreted EVs. Next, we investigated the molecular content of EVs isolated from MVA-infected PBMCs by mass spectrometry. We observed differences in the abundance of at least 57 human proteins between EVs from infected and non-infected cells. In addition, several viral proteins, including virus-encoded payloads were detected in EVs from infected cells. We are now confirming those data with flow cytometry to detect virus-encoded payloads like tumor antigens, antigen-presenting molecules, and EV markers such as tetraspanins. The RNA content of EVs from infected and non-infected cells will be compared. Finally, EVs were isolated from murine dendritic cells infected with therapeutic pox vaccines. We are now evaluating the effects of local and systemic application of EVs in murine tumor models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vaccines,Exosomes,Vaccinia virus,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Lucas Walther<sup>1<\/sup>, Caroline Tosch<sup>1<\/sup>, Jules Deforges<sup>1<\/sup>, Christine Carapito<sup>2<\/sup>, Magali Rompais<sup>2<\/sup>, Marie-Christine Claudepierre<sup>1<\/sup>, Nathalie Silvestre<sup>1<\/sup>, Kaïdre Bendjama<sup>1<\/sup>, Eric Quemeneur<sup>1<\/sup>, Jacky Goetz<sup>3<\/sup>, Vincent Hyenne<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Karola Rittner<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Transgene S.A., Illkirch Graffenstaden, France,<sup>2<\/sup>CNRS-University of Strasbourg, Laboratoire de Spectrométrie de Masse, UMR 7178, Strasbourg, France,<sup>3<\/sup>University of Strasbourg, Tumor Biomechanics Lab, INSERM UMR_S1109, Strasbourg, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b8546329-deac-4dbe-9f8d-eeedbc0afbbf","ControlNumber":"4228","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;L.

This could be attributed to the lack of direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells and the inability to trigger a strong antitumor immune response. Unlike inactivated tumor cells, living tumor cells possess a unique potential to home to and self-target tumors. Therefore, repurposing the tumor cells&#8217; self-homing property and natural source of neoantigens is advantageous for self-targeted cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we developed a genetically engineered living whole cancer cell-based therapeutic with direct tumor killing and immunostimulatory roles. We switched the tumor cells from death ligands sensitive to resistant using CRISPR\/Cas9 and subsequently engineered them to release dual cell killing and immunomodulatory agents. These engineered therapeutic tumor cells (ThTC) eliminated established tumor and activating antitumor immune cell trafficking and antigen-specific T cell activation signaling. This mechanism-based efficacy of ThTC translated into a marked survival benefit and long-term immunity in primary, recurrent, and metastatic cancer models in immunocompromised, immunocompetent and humanized mice. Arming naturally neoantigen-rich tumor cells with multidisciplinary therapeutics represents promising cell-based immunotherapy for solid tumors and establishes a roadmap towards clinical translation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vaccines,Cancer cell,Death receptors,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kok-Siong Chen<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Natalia Claire Mendonca<sup><\/sup>, Paulo Borges<sup><\/sup>, Khalid Shah<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a334c4f4-d68e-45cf-b39f-f6b2688274ef","ControlNumber":"760","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

HR+\/HER2&#8722; tumors are known for a low number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and considered less immunogenic than other breast cancer subtypes. We have demonstrated that vaccination with P10s-PADRE, a carbohydrate-mimetic-based peptide, cancer vaccine in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy in HR+\/HER2&#8722; breast cancer patients led to an increase in TILs and stromal CD3+ T cells. The current study was performed to determine the vaccine specificity and anti-tumor functionality of T cells in treated patients.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected at the baseline and after vaccination were used in T-cell assays by multi-color ELISpot, examining Th1, Th2, and cytotoxic responses. PBMCs were also interrogated for the vaccine-induced changes in immune gene expression by next-generation RNA-seq analysis.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We observed a significant increase in IFN-g, but not in IL-5 or IL-10, responses in post-immune PBMCs after stimulation with P10s, P10s-PADRE and polyclonal stimulation of T cells by anti-CD3\/CD28 antibodies. Stimulation with cancer cell lysate resulted in a strikingly high IFN-g response in post-immune samples. Determining the trio of IFN-g, GzB, and IL-2 together with CD4\/CD8 cell proliferation assays of consequent post vaccination specimens established the dynamics of effector T-cell populations. RNA-seq data clearly distinguished post-treatment samples by the increase in immune cell activation, cytokine response, and antigen presentation.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The data indicate that immunization of HR+\/HER2&#8722; breast cancer patients with P10s-PADRE in combination with chemotherapy leads to specific activation of T-cells that recognize breast cancer cells.

However, due to the severe side effects of Lenvatinib, the dose is often reduced to 12mg. Archexin, a fully phosphorothioated 20-mer antisense oligonucleotide, inhibits AKT-1 mRNA translation and inhibits tumor growth. Combination of Archexin with reduced-dosed Lenvatinib and Everolimus may reduce adverse reactions while enhancing therapeutic efficacy.<br \/>Methods: First, Lenvatinib and Everolimus monotherapies were evaluated for antitumor efficacy in an orthotopic Renca-luciferase syngeneic model. 45 mice were randomly divided into 9 groups (5 in each group), vehicle control, Lenvatinib (5, 10, 20, and 30 mg\/kg) and Everolimus (0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg\/kg) via daily oral administration for 20 days. Next, we investigated the anti-tumor effect of the two- and three-drug combination. 35 mice were randomly divided into 7 groups (5 in each group), including vehicle control, Lenvatinib\/Everolimus combinations (5+0.2, 10+0.2 and 10+0.5 mg\/kg) and Archexin\/Lenvatinib\/Everolimus combinations (60+5+0.2, 60+10+0.2 and 60+10+0.5 mg\/kg) via tail vein injection (vehicle\/Archexin, Q3D*6 times) or oral administration (Lenvatinib and Everolimus, QD*18 days). Body weight was monitored daily. Tumor burden was measured by bioluminescence through whole-body fluorescence images, performed twice a week.<br \/>Results: The results showed that Everolimus inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner. Partial response was observed in mice treated with varying doses of Lenvatinib(TGIs: 57.94%,76.65% and 60.22%), and no significant dose-effect correlation was found. The dose of Lenvatinib and Everolimus that partially inhibited the orthotopic tumor growth had also been identified and selected for subsequent study investigating drug combinations. The drugs combination study showed that three drug combinations (Archexin\/Lenvatinib\/Everolimus) had superior efficacy compared to the Lenvatinib and Everolimus combination. The fluorescence signal intensities (Lg10) of the three-drug combination were significantly lower than that of the two-drug combination group with P value &#60;0.05. No severe adverse effects were observed in the three drug combinations group.<br \/>Conclusion: Three drugs combination of Archexin, Lenvatinib and Everolimus, demonstrated superior anti-tumor efficacy compared to the two-drug combination currently used in the clinic. This finding suggests the three-drug combination warrant investigation in the clinical trial in the patients with advanced renal cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,AKT-1 inhibition,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Fengyang Xie<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jia Wei<sup>2<\/sup>, Lan Deng<sup>2<\/sup>, Chao Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Ben Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, Robert  J.

Therefore, activation of STING pathway has been considered as an important target for cancer immunotherapy. <u>E<\/u>cto-<u>N<\/u>ucleotide <u>P<\/u>yrophosphatase\/<u>P<\/u>hosphodiesterases 1 (ENPP1), highly expressed membrane-bound enzyme in cancer cells, modulates cGAMP levels by hydrolyzing 2&#8217;,3&#8217;-cGAMP to alter the inflammatory mileu. In this study, we show that targeting ENPP1 is a promising strategy for STING regulation in cancer immunotherapy through indirect activation of the STING pathway.<br \/>Methods: The ENPP1 inhibitory activities were measured by ENPP1 enzyme assay using both pNP-TMP and cGAMP as substrates. Cell-based activities were assessed by measuring IFN-beta release using THP-1 dual reporter assay. To validate biological functions, we evaluated cancer-cell killing effects of immune cells in co-culture spheroid system and T cell proliferation assay. The <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor efficacy of our compound was assessed by monitoring tumor growth in CT-26 syngeneic mouse model.<br \/>Results: LCB33 ENPP1 inhibitor shows excellent ENPP1 inhibitory activity at an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 0.9nM and 1nM in enzyme assay using pNP-TMP and cGAMP as substrates, respectively. Our compound showed extensive ENPP1 selectivity in the PDE and kinase panel assays and favorable <i>in vivo<\/i> pharmacokinetic properties. The results from THP-1 dual reporter assay demonstrated the potency and efficacy of our compound which induce STING-mediated type I IFN release. In co-culture spheroids, our compounds induced immune cell penetration into spheroids, which indicates that immune-cell mediated tumor cell death via ENPP1 inhibition. Furthermore, LCB33 compound stimulated cytokine production without affecting to the proliferation of human T cells. Finally, in the CT-26 colorectal syngeneic mouse model, oral administration at 5 mg\/kg demonstrated a TGI of 39% as monotherapy and a TGI of 72% in combination with anti-PD-L1, which describes our compound enhance anti-cancer effect of immune checkpoint blockade.<br \/>Conclusions: Taken together, we report a novel and potent small molecule ENPP1 inhibitor in this study. Our ENPP1 inhibitor showed immune-cell mediated anti-cancer effects without affecting T cell proliferation. Additionally, we confirmed that our compounds showed synergistic anti-cancer effect with immune checkpoint blocker, anti-PD-L1, in colon-cancer mouse model. Further, we are going to perform Pharmacodynamic analysis in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor associated macrophages to verify immune-modulatory function of our ENPP1 inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Immuno-oncology,Small molecule inhibitor,PD-L1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Pyoung Oh Yoon<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Juhyeon Kim<sup><\/sup>, A-Ram Lee<sup><\/sup>, Eunji Son<sup><\/sup>, Young cheol Lee<sup><\/sup>, Eunmi Jung<sup><\/sup>, HyeongRae Kim<sup><\/sup>, YeonHee Lee<sup><\/sup>, SoEun Park<sup><\/sup>, Dae-Yon Lee<sup><\/sup>, Chul-Woong Chung<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>LegoChem Biosciences, Inc, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9bf39851-b955-4bda-8f30-42ca0eae65ee","ControlNumber":"3261","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

Trefoil factor family 2 (TFF2), a secreted anti-inflammatory peptide, can suppress MDSC expansion and activate tumor immunity in part through agonism of the CXCR4 receptor. The aim of this study is to investigate whether a novel TFF2 - albumin fusion peptide (TFF2-MSA) can improve survival in anti-PD-1 treated syngeneic colorectal cancer (CRC) mouse models.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Two syngeneic colon carcinoma mouse models were developed using cell lines grafted subcutaneously into mice. MC38 CRC cells were engrafted into C57BL\/6 mice while CT26.wt CRC cells were implanted into BALB\/C mice We generated a recombinant fusion protein, designated TFF2-MSA, which contains murine TFF2 fused to murine serum albumin (MSA), for the purpose of increasing half-life and reducing dose frequency. Mice subsequently received either TFF2-MSA or anti-PD-1 antibody (clone 29F.1A12) or both, and tumor volume, and survival were measured. At the endpoint, flow cytometry was performed to examine treatment-induced effects on immune profiles.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: In the MC38 model, administration of TFF2-MSA suppressed tumor growth (TGI 38%), the combination of TFF2-MSA and anti-PD-1 had an additive effect and suppressed tumor growth dramatically (TGI 74%). The combination also exhibited a survival rate of 90% after 50 days, while vehicle and single TFF2-MSA therapy were 30% and 65%, respectively. The percentage of exhausted CD8+ T cells was markedly reduced in the draining lymph node by the combination treatment, as measured by flow cytometry using antibodies against LAG3, TIM3 and PD-1. In the CT26.wt model, administration of TFF2-MSA alone exhibited little effect, but the combination of anti-PD-1 and TFF2-MSA showed a profound effect. In the CT26.wt model, administration of TFF2-MSA suppressed tumor growth (TGI 17%), anti-PD-1 alone (TGI 43%) and the combination of TFF2-MSA and anti-PD-1 (TGI 54%).<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Targeting MDSCs using TFF2-MSA fusion protein synergizes well with PD-1 blockade therapy in advanced and metastatic syngeneic mouse models of colorectal cancer. In a separate abstract, additive effects between TFF2-MSA and anti-PD-1 antibody were also demonstrated in a separate ACKP (Atp4b-Cre; Cdh1-\/-; LSL-KrasG12D; Trp53-\/-) gastric cancer model, suggesting combination therapy may also be applicable to gastric cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Bruce  L.

TGF&#946; is expressed as a latent form (L-TGF&#946;) and presented on cell surfaces by L-TGF&#946; binding proteins (e.g. GARP and LRRC33) as part of the large latent complex, whereupon it is activated by binding to integrins, including integrin &#945;v&#946;8. Corbus Pharmaceuticals is developing a humanized monoclonal antibody, CRB-601, that binds with high specificity and affinity to &#945;v&#946;8 and blocks the critical interaction with L-TGF&#946; that promotes an immune excluded phenotype.<br \/>Methods: Tumor growth was evaluated in mice bearing orthotopically implanted murine breast cancer EMT6 or colon cancer MC38 and treated with CRB-601, anti-PD1 antibody, or the combination. &#945;v&#946;8 receptor occupancy (RO) was measured ex vivo in dissociated tumors by flow cytometry (FC). Tumor-infiltrating immune cell populations were characterized by FC, and pSMAD2\/3 was measured by Western blot.<br \/>Results: CRB-601 exhibited dose dependent tumor growth inhibition (TGI) in the EMT6 tumor model. TGI activity at 0.3mg\/kg biw dose was 22.0 &#177; 3.8 %, and reached maximum antitumor activity at a dose between 3 mg\/kg biw (41.3 &#177; 8.4%) and 10 mg\/kg biw (48.4 &#177; 8.4 %). TGI was significantly augmented in combination with anti-PD1. These effects were associated with changes in TME immune cell populations, as characterized by marked increases in infiltrating T cells, NK cells and M1 polarized macrophages, thereby converting immune excluded EMT6 tumors to immune cell-inflamed tumors. Efficacy correlated with cell surface &#945;v&#946;8 occupancy by CRB-601 as measured by FC in CD45- EMT6 tumor cells, increasing with CRB-601 dose from 5.5 &#177; 0.4% at 0.3 mg\/kg to a maximum of 75.6 &#177; 23.8% at 10 mg\/kg. CRB-601 treatment downregulated phosphorylation of SMAD proteins pSMAD2 and pSMAD3, consistent with blockade of the canonical TGF&#946; signaling pathway. When combined with anti-PD1, CRB-601 induced a T-cell memory response. In the MC38 model, mice cured by the combination treatment survived long term (&#62;40 mo). Na&#239;ve mice adoptively transferred with splenocytes from these mice gained tumor-specific antitumor activity and rejected MC38 tumor cell inoculation. These splenocytes contained an immune cell population of IFN-&#947; producing cytotoxic T cells with a repertoire consistent with MC38 antigen recognition.<br \/>Conclusions: CRB-601 is a potent and selective integrin &#945;v&#946;8 blocking monoclonal antibody that can overcome tumor immune exclusion and enhance the activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors. CRB-601 antitumor activity correlated to increased &#945;v&#946;8 RO and downregulation of TGF&#946; signaling.

However, some patients respond to ICIs despite IFN-&#947; signaling pathway defects, and the detailed mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we created <i>JAK<\/i>-deleted cancer cell lines and evaluated antitumor immunity. As a result, several tumors responded to PD-1 blockade despite <i>JAK<\/i> deletion. Such sensitive tumors had high major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) expression despite IFN-&#947; signaling pathway defects, whereas MHC-I expression was reduced by <i>JAK<\/i> deletion in resistant tumors. In particular, if cancer cells had high MHC-I expression despite defects in IFN-&#947; signaling pathways, chemokines that recruit effector T cells were mainly produced by immune cells rather than cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment. Accordingly, we found a response to ICIs in a patient with JAK-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, whose human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) expression level was maintained. In addition, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screening to identify molecules with elevated MHC-I expression independent of IFN-&#947; signaling pathways demonstrated that guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit gamma 4 (GNG4) maintained MHC-I expression via the NF-&#954;B signaling pathway. Our results indicate that patients with IFN-&#612; signaling pathway defects are not always resistant to ICIs, and highlight the importance of MHC-I expression among the pathways, including inhibitory effects on cellular proliferation or chemokine production, and the possibility of NF-&#954;B-targeted therapies to overcome such resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interferons,Immune checkpoint blockade,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Katsushige Kawase<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Shusuke Kawashima<sup>2<\/sup>, Joji Nagasaki<sup>3<\/sup>, Takashi Inozume<sup>2<\/sup>, Hiromasa Yamamoto<sup>3<\/sup>, Masahito Kawazu<sup>1<\/sup>, Toyoyuki Hanazawa<sup>2<\/sup>, Yosuke Togashi<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Chiba Cancer Center Research Institute, Chiba, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Chiba University, Chiba, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Okayama University, Okayama, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"889b339a-9a41-4c19-b8e8-a67f0e6e9705","ControlNumber":"3287","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

IL13R&#945;2 expression is limited in normal tissues but is highly overexpressed by various tumors including pancreatic, colorectal, glioblastomas, and prostate cancer. MDNA132 is an engineered IL-13 superkine with high specificity for IL13R&#945;2 and no binding to IL13R&#945;1 enabling targeted delivery of therapeutic immune modulators to the tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, we characterize a long-acting version of MDNA132 and Bi-functional SuperKine ImmunoTherapies (BiSKITs) comprising fusion of MDNA132 with an IL-2 super-agonist or anti-PD1 antibody.<br \/><u>Materials and Methods<\/u>: MDNA132 fused to Fc scaffold (to improve half-life), MDNA109FEAA (&#8216;beta&#8217; only IL-2 super-agonist) or anti-PD1 were characterized by SPR and <i>in vitro<\/i> functional assays. IL2R activity was evaluated based on pSTAT5 signaling and anti-PD1 mediated blockade by a cell-based reporter assay. Flow cytometry studies were conducted to evaluate receptor internalization by cells expressing IL13R&#945;2. Localization of Fc-MDNA132 in IL13R&#945;2-expressing tumor bearing animals was determined by in vivo imaging system (IVIS).<br \/><u>Results<\/u>: Fc-MDNA132 does not bind to IL13R&#945;1 while exhibiting high affinity for both human and murine IL13R&#945;2. MDNA132 BiSKITs incorporating either IL-2 agonist (MDNA109FEAA-Fc-MDNA132) or anti-PD1 antibody (anti-PD1-MDNA132) maintained selective affinity towards their respective receptors (IL13R&#945;2, IL2R&#946; and PD1). In reporter cell assays, MDNA109FEAA-Fc-MDNA132 showed increased potency of pSTAT5 stimulation relative to IL-2 (25-fold) and anti-PD1-MDNA132 reversed PD1\/PDL1 blockade similar to parental anti-PD1 antibody. Receptor internalization studies showed that MDNA132\/IL13R&#945;2 ligand-receptor complex is retained on cell surface indicating the potential to achieve durable exposure of the immune-modulatory payloads in the TME. IVIS analysis of athymic mice implanted contralaterally with IL13R&#945;2 positive (A375 or U87) and IL-13R&#945;2 negative (A549) tumors showed durable (&#62;6 days) and selective localization of Fc-MDNA132 to IL13&#945;2 expressing tumors following intravenous administration.

Although immunotherapy to block this may provide a greater survival benefit for some patients, the therapeutic effect shown in clinical trials is limited by shortage of pre-existing CD8+ T cells infiltrating the tumor. AST-301 is a pDNA-based therapeutic cancer vaccine encoding HER2 ICD sequence. It was effective in eliciting HER2-specific T cells and antibody immunity in the majority of breast and ovarian cancer patients who completed the vaccine regimen and has proven safety as well as long-term immunological memory efficacy of T-cell immune by the phase 1 study (PN 109, NCT00436254). Our previous study has shown that AST-301 has anti-tumor effects by mediating NK cells in human HER2+ gastric cancer cell (NCI-N87) xenograft athymic mice. Here, we aimed to determine whether combined administration of AST-301 can enhance the anti-tumor effect of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) using NCI-N87 xenograft humanized mouse. To confirm the tumor suppressive effect of pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) treatment combined with AST-301 in the hu-CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell-engrafted NSG mice that formed tumors with NCI-N87, AST-301 (100 &#956;g) and pembrolizumab (5 mg\/kg) were administered into mice once a week for a total of 3 times and one booster doses of AST-301 was injected at week 4. Pembrolizumab low dose (5 mg\/kg) test group administered with AST-301 had a relatively higher tumor growth inhibition (TGI) effect than the same concentration of Pembrolizumab alone group. TGI effect (%) of G2 (a combination of AST-301 and Pembrolizumab 5 mg\/kg), G3 (Pembrolizumab 5 mg\/kg), and G4 (Pembrolizumab 10 mg\/kg) were 54%, 47%, and 78%, respectively. To evaluate the mechanism underlying the enhanced anti-tumor effect due to the combined administration of AST-301 and pembrolizumab, we measured the ratio of immune cells isolated from spleen and tumor in mice. in G2, the ratio of helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells in splenocytes higher than the vehicle-treated control group (G1), and the ratio of cytotoxic T cells infiltrated the tumor was also detected high in some subjects compared to those in all the other three groups. These results suggest that AST-301 can improve HER2+ gastric cancer treatment outcomes of immune checkpoint blockade therapy by inducing a robust cytotoxic CD8+ T cell response to tumor cells. Currently, we are ongoing study to prove the anti-tumor synergistic effects of the combination of AST-301 and various FDA-approved Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs). This effort is focused on narrowing the administration doses to low levels to resolve the safety issue of ADC or ICI, and it will strongly support the diverse applicability of the cancer therapeutic vaccine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,HER2\/neu,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Cytotoxic T lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hyo-Hyun Park<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hye-Ran Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Jin Kyeong Choi<sup>3<\/sup>, Jee Hyun Choi<sup>1<\/sup>, JinHo Kang<sup>1<\/sup>, Jinback Lim<sup>1<\/sup>, Hyo Jung Lim<sup>3<\/sup>, Jong Yeong Lee<sup>3<\/sup>, Eunkyo Joung<sup>4<\/sup>, Hun Jung<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Aston Research Institute, Hanam, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>National Cancer Center, Il-san, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Immunology, Jeonbuk National University Medical School, Jeonju, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>Aston Sci.

Here, we present recent preclinical development data about ALD2510, a next-gen low-fucose IL-2\/T<sub>CONV<\/sub>-sparing anti-CD25 antibody designed for the selective depletion of CD25<sup>high<\/sup> T<sub>REGS<\/sub> and the boost of host anti-tumor immunity. Ultra-humanization of parental anti-CD25 antibody was achieved through phage display and, in parallel, all putative liability sequences were replaced for maximizing developability while minimizing off-target and immunogenicity risks. ALD2510 sequences were re-formatted and used for further CHO cell line development, using the GlymaxX&#8482; technology which boosts Fc effector functions. Early tox ALD2510 material was produced following 10L fed-batch USP\/DSP and analytical characterization, including a 6-month early stability study. Preliminary safety and pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic (PKPD) profile of ALD2510 were then determined through a non-GLP MTD\/DRF study in cynomolgus monkey. ALD2510 demonstrated excellent potency (T<sub>REG<\/sub> depletion, ADCC, ADCP), manufacturability and stability together with very low immunogenicity potential. CHO productivity reached ~4g\/L in 10L fed-batch bioreactor and characterization revealed excellent purity and activity in line with its low fucose content, together with very low levels of process- or cell-related impurities. This material showed a good behavior during the 6-month stability study and was therefore administered in cynomolgus monkeys during a non-GLP exploratory MTD\/DRF study. Increasing doses of ALD2510 (from 0.3 to 100mg\/kg) were given to four animals during MTD and same animals received three additional doses at 100mg\/kg during DRF. Very good tolerability and safety were reported in animals. ALD2510 half-life and exposure were found consistent with that of humanized IgG1 in cynomolgus. Strong T<sub>REG<\/sub> depletion was monitored in the blood in all animals with, importantly, no drop was observed in CD4<sup>+<\/sup> or CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells, confirming ALD2510 capacity to selectively target T<sub>REGS<\/sub> while sparing T<sub>CONV<\/sub>. Overall, ALD2510 demonstrated excellent potency, manufacturability and stability during the 1<sup>st<\/sup> phase of preclinical development. Very good tolerability and safety profile together with satisfying PKPD data were reported during exploratory MTD\/DRF study in cynomolgus monkeys. Noteworthy, strong T<sub>REG<\/sub> depletion was confirmed while CD4<sup>+<\/sup> or CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells were not impacted, confirming ALD2510 selectivity for T<sub>REGS<\/sub> while sparing T<sub>CONV<\/sub>. This makes ALD2510 a promising candidate for the treatment of solid tumors, in particular those where the presence of T<sub>REGS<\/sub> in the TME is associated with worse prognosis and\/or resistance to CPI.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Therapeutic antibody,Treg depletion,CD25,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jemila Houacine<sup>1<\/sup>, Riad Abes<sup>1<\/sup>, Anne Marie-Cardine<sup>1<\/sup>, Aude Le Roy<sup>1<\/sup>, Bettina Serbin<sup>1<\/sup>, Lucie Robert<sup>2<\/sup>, Jérôme Giustiniani<sup>3<\/sup>, Anne-Sophie Chrétien<sup>4<\/sup>, Stéphane Fattori<sup>4<\/sup>, Laurent Gorvel<sup>4<\/sup>, Armand Bensussan<sup>5<\/sup>, Daniel Olive<sup>4<\/sup>, <b>Arnaud Foussat<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Alderaan Biotechnology, Paris, France,<sup>2<\/sup>Inserm UMR1068, Centre de Recherche en Cancérologie de Marseille, Marseilles, France,<sup>3<\/sup>Inserm U955, Hôpital Henri Mondor, Créteil, France,<sup>4<\/sup>Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseilles, France,<sup>5<\/sup>INSERM U976, Hôpital Saint Louis, Paris, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6064e47e-605a-41f0-9c6b-fa0e5060df8d","ControlNumber":"6185","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.
