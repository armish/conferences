[{"Abstract":"Background: Genome-wide cell-free DNA fragmentation profiling was suggested to be useful for early cancer detection. However, it still needed to be evaluated using sample before cancer diagnosis.<br \/>Methods: A prospective cohort with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-seropositive participants were enrolled in 2012 and followed-up biannually with blood sample collections till 31 December 2019. A case-control study with hospital hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases were conducted to identify potential biomarkers for HCC detection (Discovery). We adapted the DELFI method (Cristiano et al, Nature, 2019) and evaluated cfDNA fragmentation profile (AdaptDelfi) for detecting HCC at the Discovery phase and validated AdaptDelfi in an independent prospective population cohort (Validation).<br \/>Results: Of 18,373 participants, 2,893 were HBV-seropositive and developed 81 incident HCC cases. In Discovery, the AdaptDelfi model distinguished HCC cases from controls excellently (AUC [95% confidence interval] = 0.999 [0.997 - 1.0]), while the serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) had an AUC of 0.851 (95% CI = 0.796 - 0.906). High AdaptDelfi was associated with advanced tumor stage (<i>P <\/i>= 0.038). The hazard of death increased in high AdaptDelfi (hazard ratio 2.43, 95% CI = 1.13 - 5.2) after adjustment for tumor stage. In Validation, AdaptDelfi showed slightly increasing performance using pre-HCC samples collected &#8805;4 years (AUC = 0.530), 3-4 years (0.615), 2-3 years (0.781), 1-2 years (0.711), and 0-1 year (0.770) before diagnosis. These were comparable with the traditional biomarker - AFP that showed corresponding AUCs of 0.521, 0.525, 0.517, 0.575 and 0.727, respectively. Using a fixed cutoff value from Discovery, AdaptDelfi had a specificity of 88.0% and a sensitivity of 32.5% within one year before diagnosis in detecting early HCC, yielding an estimated positive predict value (PPV) of 1.4% (95% CI = 0.8% - 2.4%) among HBV-seropositive male population.<br \/>Conclusions: The genome-wide cell-free DNA fragmentation is correlated with HCC stage and may be a useful biomarker for diagnosing clinical HCC and predict patient survival. However, the low PPV suggests its utility in HCC screening in high-risk populations so far may be limited.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-15 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Early detection,Liquid biopsy,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Population-based cancer screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shifeng Lian<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Fang Fang<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhiwei Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Mingfang Ji<sup>3<\/sup>, Zongli Zheng<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden,<sup>2<\/sup>National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD,<sup>3<\/sup>Cancer Research Institute of Zhongshan City, Zhongshan, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"296055cd-7ef1-4ef2-afd5-11aaae73cd64","ControlNumber":"3567","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Additionally, mutations in hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13), which encodes hepatic lipid droplet protein, have been found the involvement in various metabolic processes. Loss-of-function mutations in the human HSD17B13 gene may confer a strong protective effect on liver injury, inflammation, fibrosis, and even onset of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we evaluated the characteristics of Japanese patients with FLD- HCC and considered the risk factors of HCC including genetic background.<br \/>Methods: We enrolled 402 patients of clinically and pathologically diagnosed with FLD (alcohol: 63, nonalcohol: 339) in our hospital from 1990-2018 (228 males, median age 54.9 [14.6-83.6] years). We analyzed the survival and new-onset HCC rates according to the etiology of FLD (alcohol and nonalcohol), hepatic fibrosis, FIB-4 index, and genetic background of PNPLA3 and HSD17B13 for consideration of the risk factors.<br \/>Results: FLD-HCC was observed in 57 cases (14.2%). Comparing to the patients with HSD17B13 wild-type AA (212 cases) and mutant (A\/AA or AA\/AA, 190 cases), patients with wild type showed significantly increased HCC complication (wild vs. mutant; 39 [18.4%] vs. 18 [9.5%], p = 0.01) and these were tended to be high complication of hypertension (120 [56.6%] vs. 90 [47.4%], p = 0.06). In patients with mutant of HSD17B13, HCC incidence was significantly reduced in alcohol-related FLD, FIB-4 index &#60;2.67, and PNPLA3 CC genotype, however, there was not significant difference in nonalcohol-FLD. Patients with HSD17B13 mutant showed severe steatosis (77% vs. 88.6%). Eleven cases of new HCC were developed during observation period (8.1 [0.5-25.1] years) (n = 370). Five-year incidence of HCC was 3.3% in patients with both PNPLA3 GG\/GC and HSD17B13 wild type and it was significantly elevated compared to other SNP profiles (0.6%, p = 0.03). Multivariate analysis identified the risk of FLD-HCC including age, gender, and complication of hypertension.<br \/>Conclusions: Genetic background of FLD may associate with onset of HCC. Inhibiting HSD17B13 activity may prevent HCC development, especially in alcohol-related FLD and patients with low risk factors. Therefore, SNPs of gene combination with other risk factors may use for screening tool for FLD-HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-07 Genomics and proteomics in cancer risk and response assessment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tomomi Kogiso<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Yuri Ogasawara<sup><\/sup>, Kentaro Horiuchi<sup><\/sup>, Makiko Taniai<sup><\/sup>, Katsutoshi Tokushige<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2c8e2bc9-aa76-45a9-8501-1fc9b74c0cab","ControlNumber":"1986","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

Advances in biocompatible organoid technology have made it possible to culture cancer organoids from human tumor tissues. Cancer organoids are easy to proliferate, and large-scale drug screening platforms can be developed in that they can reproducibly repeat experiments with various concentrations of drugs. In this study, we developed automated extracellular matrix integrated, three-dimensional, patient-derived cell spotting technology and pillar-based cancer organoid culture system for anticancer drug screening platform as a preclinical model which able to contribute for prediction of therapeutic responses and selection of optimal next line anticancer drugs. In case of ovarian cancer, about 70-80% of patients are firstly diagnosed, but their 5-year survival rate is still under 50%. To increase the 5-year survival rate, raising therapeutic responses is urgently needed by effective drug treatment rather than standard therapy. For drugs selected through a drug screening platform to be applied to actual clinical practice, standard test methods must be set up, and clinical results and organoid-based treatment responses must be clearly compared and verified. For validation above, we confirmed the organoid on pillar-based drug testing platform by using surgical specimens from 109 ovarian cancer patients from SMC (Samsung medical center). Primary cells with extracellular matrix spotted and cultured on 384 pillar plates by ASFA spotter (MBD Inc.). After organoid formation on pillars, anticancer drug screening was performed for 14 drug combinations using cancer organoids derived from the ascites of patients. Cell viabilities and drug responses were calculated by ATP measurement and staining of intracellular Calcein then. Particularly in this study, parallel with drug treatment, organoid growth rate was measured by comparing the average areas, processed by ASFA cell analyzer (MBD Inc.), of organoids at drug treatment and termination day. Finally anticancer drug sensitivity index was calculated by combination of the drug response of AUC and respective organoid growth rate, then it was verified by matching with the clinical responses of 1<sup>st<\/sup> chemotherapies after surgery. As a results, the drug susceptibility index was predicted patients of recurrence within 6-month after 1<sup>st<\/sup> chemotherapy by our drug screening platform with increased sensitivity and specificity. This anticancer drug screening platform raised the recurrence prediction about 90% compared to existing drug sensitivity index such as IC<sub>50<\/sub> or AUC, and through this, this platform could contribute to precision medicine in ovarian cancer patients. Therefore, it can be preclinical model used to screen the optimal drug for customized treatment using patient-specific individual organoids.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-15 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug sensitivity,Ovarian cancer,Precision medicine,Organoids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hye Ryeong Jun<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sung Hun Ju<sup>1<\/sup>, Jung Eun Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Dong Woo Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Bosung Ku<sup>1<\/sup>, Joseph Noh<sup>2<\/sup>, Jeogn-Won Lee<sup>2<\/sup>, Hyun Ju Kang<sup>3<\/sup>, Jin-Ku Lee<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Precision medicine research institute, MBD Co, Ltd., Suwon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Genomic Medicine Institute, Medical Research Center, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Biomedical Sciences, Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"88818698-e499-40d5-b0e2-338c84336e7a","ControlNumber":"2357","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

In response to stress, CIRP moves to the cytoplasm where it regulates translation; a fraction of the cytoplasmic CIRP is released extracellularly (eCIRP). eCIRP is a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule that promotes inflammatory responses including TNF-alpha, IL-6, and HMGB production. Lymphocytes, macrophages, and PMN&#8217;s are activated after surgery and can generate eCIRP. Elevated eCIRP blood levels may impact macrophage function and induce immune tolerance that may promote tumor growth and progression. This study&#8217;s purpose was to measure plasma eCIRP levels before and for a month after MICR for CRC.<br \/>Methods: CRC patients (pts) in an IRB approved data\/tissue bank who underwent MICR for whom plasma was available were selected. Demographic, clinical and pathology data were reviewed. Plasma samples were collected preoperatively (preOp) and at 6 post-operative (Postop) time points (POD 1, 3, 7-13, 14-20, 21-27, 28-41); samples were processed and frozen until used. Late samples were bundled into 7-day blocks and considered as single time points. eCIRP levels were analyzed in duplicate using ELISA. The Wilcoxon paired t-test was used for analysis.<br \/>Results: 83 CRC pts who underwent MICR were studied (colon 66%, rectal 34%; mean age 65); 26% had Hand assisted (HA) MIS (mean incision length[IL] 10.0&#177;2.9cm) and 69% laparoscopic (LAP, mean IL 6.9&#177;4.1cm) MICR. The cancer stage breakdown was; I, 30%; II, 32%; III, 35% and IV, 3%. The mean PreOp eCIRP level was 896.8&#177; 757.0pg\/ml; vs. preop levels increased mean plasma levels (p=&#60;0.001) were noted on POD1 (2549&#177; 2632pg\/ml, n= 83), POD3 (1871&#177; 1362pg\/ml, n= 77), POD7-13 (1788&#177; 1403pg\/ml, n=57), POD14-20 (1473&#177; 738.8pg\/ml, n=30), and POD 21-27 (1681&#177; 1375pg\/ml, n= 21). With regard to MIS method, greater eCIRP increases were noted in the HA vs the Lap group from POD1-POD20 (p=0.01-0.04).<br \/>Conclusions: Plasma eCIRP levels are elevated for a month after MICR for CRC (% change range 100-184) and peaked on POD1. The cause of the early increase may be the acute inflammatory response whereas the late elevations may be related to wound healing-related tissue remodeling. Higher mean levels in the HA vs Lap group suggests that the extent of surgical trauma impacts eCIRP levels postop. Previous studies noted increased post-MICR plasma levels of MCP-1, CHI3L1 and IL8 that stimulate macrophage activity. eCIRP, together with those proteins may promote macrophage recruitment and function and might promote the growth of residual tumor deposits postop. Further studies are warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-02 Biomarkers and intervention studies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Surgical resection,Biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chandana S.

Traditionally, the usefulness of RNA-Seq has been limited by pre-analytical (sample availability, low integrity, tumor heterogeneity, complex protocols) and analytical factors (small mRNA fraction, high read duplicate rate), which can lead to higher costs, longer turnaround times, and false negative results. We have developed and automated a streamlined workflow for construction of highly complex RNA Libraries from fresh frozen and FFPE samples that addresses these concerns. We use target enrichment by bait selection with FFPE-derived samples, where rRNA depletion is found to be inconsistent and poly(A) enrichment cannot be used due to degradation of the source material. A fully automated protocol using pre-aliquoted reagents, has been optimized on the Magnis NGS Prep System for a wide range of RNA inputs (10-200 ng), various sample types (Intact and FFPE total RNA) and equipped with 192 Unique Dual sample Indices (UDI) to minimize the effects of possible index hopping and contamination. Addition of in-line molecular barcodes incorporated at the ligation step helps differentiate fragmentation from PCR duplicates, which increases the total number of reads available for further analysis (gene expression and fusion detection). With minimal risk of contamination, this automated protocol delivers up to eight target-enriched NGS Illumina sequencing-ready cDNA libraries from total RNA input per run in about 12 hours without the need of any user intervention. Both catalog and custom probes can be utilized, and PCR cycles can easily be adjusted from the touchscreen to optimize the library yields. For Research Use Only.

Despite advancements that have led to improved survival of lung cancer patients, the prognosis of lung cancer brain metastases (LCBM) is still dismal. Brain MRI is currently the method of choice for BM assessment. However, it is limited due to a lack of surveillance. Cytosolic evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is generally unsatisfactory due to its poor sensitivity. Therefore, exploring a sensitive and accurate method for early detection of BM in lung cancer patients is needed to improve disease management.<br \/>Methods: CSF circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) of 81 lung cancer patients confirmed or suspected of BM who were screened between June 2019 and October 2021 were analyzed using targeted next-generation sequencing. Patients were classified into three subgroups according to their BM status and the relationship with sampling time, including 61 POS patients (patients whose BM status was already positive at CSF sampling), 10 NEG patients (patients whose BM status was negative at CSF sampling and remained unchanged during the follow-up), and 9 NTP patients (patients whose BM status turned from negative at CSF sampling to positive during the follow-up). The training dataset recruited 70 patients whose BM status at CSF sampling was definitive, including 62 POS and 8 randomly selected NEG patients. The testing dataset consisted of 11 patients, including 9 NTP and 2 randomly selected NEG patients. A robust machine learning model was developed based on the 6bp breakpoint motif (BPM) features in CSF ctDNA. The mutational profile of CSF ctDNA was also assessed to reveal potential prognostic-related genetic alterations in LCBM.<br \/>Results: The BM predictive model built on BPM features demonstrated a remarkable capacity to detect LCBM, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.929 and 0.944 in the training and testing datasets, respectively. Model performance was not significantly improved by combining CSF ctDNA status features.

Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identified genetic variants associated with cervical cancer in women of European and Asian ancestry, particularly within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). However, owing to the complexity of linkage disequilibrium and varied environmental exposures in different ancestral populations, regional GWASs are needed to investigate the genetic contribution to the pathogenesis of cervical cancer in continental African populations. A total of 1,637 cervical cancer patients and 761 controls in women of African ancestry were identified from the Johannesburg Cancer Study and the AWI-Gen study, respectively. DNA samples were genotyped on the 2.3 million H3Africa GWAS SNP array and genotyped SNPs imputed to a total of 13,937,308 SNPs. The association between genetic variants and cervical cancer was tested using linear mixed models, adjusting for five principal components and cryptic relatedness. We identified one locus within the MHC region associated with cervical cancer at genome-wide significance, led by rs3129965 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.87-0.92, P = 2.292 x 10-11) near HLA-DRA. Four other loci were strongly associated with cervical cancer (P&#60;5x10-7), including rs575105445 (OR=0.77, 95%CI=0.70-0.85, P = 2.188 x 10-07) near HLA-C,rs184053148 (OR =0.79, 95% CI = 0.72-0.86, P = 4.19 x 10-07) in TRIM31,rs12496921 (OR=0.88, 95%CI = 0.84-0.92, P = 1.32 x 10-07) in ROPN1B and rs114031308 (OR= 1.27, 95% CI =1.16-1.39, P =3.06 x 10-07) near TTC26. The genes in these loci are implicated in numerous pathways including antiviral immunity, DNA repair, the regulation of p53, apoptosis, cell growth and differentiation. These discoveries demonstrate the important contribution of common genetic variants to cervical cancer susceptibility and provide insights into its pathogenesis in women of African ancestry.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-07 Genomics and proteomics in cancer risk and response assessment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cervical cancer,Genetic susceptibility,Genome-wide association studies (GWAS),Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Abram Bunya Kamiza<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Wenlong Carl Chen<sup><\/sup>, Jean-Tristan Brandenberg<sup><\/sup>, Michele Ramsay<sup><\/sup>, Christopher  G.

Muscle invasion BC (MIBC) has a poor prognosis and is usually in an advanced stage. Recently, whole genome sequencing research in BC has pointed out the molecular subtypes of BC which presented correlate with the patient outcome as well as clinical behavior. There are differences between the stratification&#8217;s subtypes determined by several research teams. However, the central of these stratifications are classified the BC into the basal BC type and the luminal BC type. We aim to use the immunohistochemical surrogated markers for basal and luminal BC subtypes to discriminate the molecular subtypes of BC and their association with the clinicopathologic features of BC. <b>Method: <\/b>We performed IHCs for surrogated basal makers (CK5\/6 and CD44), and surrogated luminal makers (CK20 and Gata3) in 130 MIBC patients. IHCs classified the MICB into the fourth group including basal type (positive with CK5\/6 and\/or CD44 and negative both of CK20 and Gata3), luminal type (negative both of CK5\/6 and CD44 and positive with CK20 and\/or Gata3), null type (negative for all fourth markers) and mixed type (expressed both basal and luminal markers), respectively. We investigated the relationship between the molecular subtypes and the clinicopathological significance of MIBC patients. Furthermore, we analyzed the association of molecular subtypes with the overall survival of MIBC patients. We also analyzed the IMVigor210 cohort and the TCGA-BLCA cohort to validate our results. We investigated the chemo reagents (cisplatin, and 5-Fu) resistance of the BC cell lines which molecular subtypes classified by IHCs. <b><\/b> <b>Results: <\/b>We figured out that the basal subtype and luminal subtype presented 35.28% and 29.23% of MIBC respectively. The null subtype accounted for 18.47% of MIBC. The basal subtype was associated with T stage (p=0.035), squamous differentiation (p=0.0002), stage (p=0.035), and tumor infiltrated lymphocytes (TILs) (p=0.047). There were no significantly different between the overall survival of the basal and mixed subtype of MIBC and the luminal and null subtype MIBC (Log-rank test, p=0.090). Interestingly, we explored that the MIBC without intensive TILs - basal subtype presented the worst prognosis in comparison with other molecular subtypes (Log-rank test, p=0.012). The mRNA basal subtype also presented poor prognosis in BC without immune activities in BLCA (p=0.037) or in IMVigor210 (p=0.0005). Furthermore, the basal cell lines presented lower IC50 than luminal cell lines when treated the cells with cisplatin. <b>Conclusion: <\/b>Our results pointed out that the molecular subtypes of MIBC were associated with the progression of MIBC. The MIBC patients without intensive TILs - basal subtype have the worst outcome. Suggesting that stratification of molecular subtypes of MIBC by IHCs are appealing option for clinical implementation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-01 Application of molecular pathology in clinical prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>QuocThang Pham<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Anh Toan Do<sup>2<\/sup>, Ngoc Minh Tam Nguyen<sup>3<\/sup>, Phuc Nguyen Nguyen<sup>4<\/sup>, Thi Phuong Thao Doan<sup>5<\/sup>, Thi Thanh Tam Bui<sup>5<\/sup>, Quoc Dat Ngo<sup>5<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Ho Chi Minh City Medicine and Pharmacy University, Ho Chi Minh, Viet Nam,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Urology, Ho Chi Minh City Medicine and Pharmacy University, Ho Chi Minh, Viet Nam,<sup>3<\/sup>Pathology, Binh Dan Hospital, Ho Chi Minh, Viet Nam,<sup>4<\/sup>Binh Dan Hospital, Ho Chi Minh, Viet Nam,<sup>5<\/sup>Pathology, Ho Chi Minh City Medicine and Pharmacy University, Ho Chi Minh, Viet Nam","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6d4baab4-c787-40e2-bbcf-91b381d95217","ControlNumber":"589","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Q.

Defining an optimal approach for tissue of origin (TOO) localization in individuals with cancer-suspected MCED results is critical. Two recent prospective trials employed differing and distinct approaches for conducting TOO evaluation. The PATHFINDER study conducted molecular TOO testing for localization and DETECT-A used upfront neck-to-thigh imaging-first to rule-in or rule-out and then to localize the cancer. Using mathematical modeling, we examined the diagnostic burden of each approach.<br \/>Methods: Building upon a published quantitative framework, a mathematical expression for diagnostic burden was derived as a function of positive predictive value (PPV) of the detection module, TOO accuracy of the localization module, and number of procedures associated with each diagnostic outcome; the latter were estimated from established clinical guidelines with diagnostic procedures narrowly selected for molecular TOO calls. We then explored the relationship between PPV, TOO accuracy, and diagnostic burden. Imaging and molecular TOO strategies were compared by estimating absolute difference in diagnostic burden across a range of performance levels.<br \/>Results: With a molecular TOO strategy we estimate 2.1 procedures to reach diagnostic resolution for correctly-localized true positives, 4.4 for incorrectly-localized true positives, and 4 for false positives; with imaging TOO, 2.75 procedures for true positives and 2.4 for false positives. Across the entire spectrum of performance for both detection and localization, a strategy with molecular TOO resulted in a mean diagnostic burden of 3.6 (Var 0.198); with imaging TOO, 2.6 (Var 0.010). The breakeven curve defined by zero absolute difference between strategies shows that molecular TOO has lower burden for only 4.5% of all possible PPV and TOO accuracy combinations and that 79% PPV is required for a 90% accurate molecular TOO strategy to be less burdensome than imaging TOO.<br \/>Conclusions: This analysis demonstrates that imaging TOO is more efficient than molecular TOO across 95.5% of all possible PPV and TOO accuracy combinations. Molecular TOO can reduce diagnostic burden when localization accuracy is very high or overall test PPV is very high. This analysis highlights the need for ongoing innovation in cancer detection and cancer localization as separable parts of the MCED test. In summary, the use of advanced imaging first to determine TOO as part of an MCED screening approach is likely less burdensome than a broad molecular TOO approach, although a nuanced approach to molecular TOO based on probability and type of cancer may contribute to diagnostic efficiency.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-15 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Early detection,Molecular diagnosis,Imaging,Modeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Christopher Tyson<sup>1<\/sup>, Elizabeth  K.

Perceived effectiveness and perceived ease of use were positively associated with intention to complete mt-sDNA screening (b = 0.404, p &#60; .001; b = 0.339, p &#60; .001). &#8220;Why&#8221; communication contributed to screening intention through influencing perceived effectiveness (b-indirect effect = 0.141, 95% CI: 0.115, 0.177). &#8220;How&#8221; communication contributed to screening intention through influencing perceived ease of use (b-indirect effect = 0.133, 95% CI: 0.104, 0.172).<br \/>Conclusions: Improving patients&#8217; beliefs about the effectiveness and ease of use of screening may be one pathway through which provider communication contributes to CRC screening completion. Efforts are needed to develop and implement provider-patient communication strategies and toolkits that are efficacious at fostering patient understanding of the rationale for CRC screening and the effectiveness of available screening options as well as addressing barriers and enhancing patients&#8217; self-efficacy in completing their preferred screening option.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-15 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Screening,Prevention,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xuan Zhu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Paul Limburg<sup>2<\/sup>, Linda Squiers<sup>3<\/sup>, Leah Helmueller<sup>2<\/sup>, Gabriel Madson<sup>3<\/sup>, Brian Southwell<sup>3<\/sup>, Carlye Gates<sup>3<\/sup>, Shama Alam<sup>2<\/sup>, Jennifer Laffin<sup>2<\/sup>, Lila Finney Rutten<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN,<sup>2<\/sup>Exact Sciences Corporation, Madison, WI,<sup>3<\/sup>RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"dd01defc-82da-4361-831a-a63abe0a4bdc","ControlNumber":"2905","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;X.

Increased detection is in part due to expanded lung cancer screening criteria in an aging population. Distinguishing multiple primary tumors from intrapulmonary metastases can be challenging, yet is critical for determining clinical management. Current models predict development of multiple primary tumors out of a cancerized field, such as occurs due to smoking. The occurrence of multiple primary tumors is unexplained in patients with <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant lung cancer (~15% of all NSCLC), lacking environmental exposures. We identified patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented with multiple primary <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant tumors, in the absence of family history of lung cancer or heavy smoking. We subjected the macrodissected tumors and surrounding normal tissues to whole exome sequencing as well as to analysis of hypermutable poly-guanine (poly-G) repeats, which are two orthogonal methods of lineage tracing. An additional familial case with a germline <i>EGFR<\/i>-T790M mutation was used to establish parameters for timing of somatic mutations, and functional properties of novel germline variants were modeled <i>in vitro<\/i>. Of eleven non-familial NSCLC cases with two or more geographically distinct <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant lung cancers, two patients harbored a germline <i>EGFR<\/i> variant allele, which confers moderately enhanced signaling <i>in vitro<\/i>, followed by a somatically acquired <i>EGFR<\/i> mutation. In an additional four cases, both whole exome sequencing and poly-G repeat analyses indicate a distant shared somatic cell-of-origin, consistent with embryonic mosaicism. Three cases revealed clinically unappreciated metastasis and two cases remain unexplained. Together, our data suggest that multiple primary lung cancers with somatic <i>EGFR<\/i> driver mutations may result from genetic susceptibility, attributable either to attenuated <i>EGFR<\/i> germline variants or to embryonic mosaicism resulting in geographically disparate patches of predisposed lung tissue. Such predisposed cases should be surveilled for early detection of future tumors, and surgical resection in these cases should consider the life-long risk of additional cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-07 Genomics and proteomics in cancer risk and response assessment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Whole exome sequencing,Predisposition,Genetic mosaicism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Risa Burr<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ignaty Leshchiner<sup>2<\/sup>, Christina  L.

Human germline genetics are usually characterized by a series of millions of SNP's. Polygenic risk scores estimate risk from a linear combination of these SNPs, but non-linear may also contribute. Modern machine learning algorithms excel at identifying differences in these non-linear combinations between two groups. However, these algorithms require many more subjects than features (SNPs). Thus, these algorithms can't be used to recognize genetic differences between two populations, unless one has millions of subjects. We developed a representation of the human genome that requires only dozens of numbers, each representing a measure of the length of a chromosome. We used this representation and machine learning methods to test two hypotheses related to breast cancer. We test whether any distinguishable genetic differences exist between (1) women who develop breast cancer and women who do not develop it and (2) women who have a recurrent breast tumor and those who do not. To test our hypotheses, we used data from UK Biobank, for recurrence, and the NIH All of Us datasets, for occurrence. We computed a set of numbers representing the chromosome scale length variation from germline DNA for each woman in the dataset. For each test we constructed a dataset that consisted of women with the desired trait (TRUE) and an equal number of age-matched participants that did not have the desired trait (FALSE). We used the H2O AI platform in conjunction with R statistical computing environment to train and test machine learning models to distinguish between the two classes in each dataset. To quantify the performance of the developed models, we calculated evaluation metrices of the best ML model on an unseen test data set. We compared the AUC of these models to a control for each dataset, in which we randomly scrambled the TRUE\/FALSE labels. The UK Biobank has 488,377 patients with genetic data. There are 13968 patients within the dataset that have been diagnosed with breast cancer at least once through the study time. Among them, 489 patients have had breast cancer recurrence. Our machine learning model assigns a score to each patient based on their germ line genetics. We found that patients ranked by this score in the highest quintile are approximately 2.36 times as likely to have breast cancer recurrence compared to the lowest quantile. For the occurrence model, we assessed ALL of US genetic data which consists of 98,600 participants with whole genome sequencing data. There are 8260 female participants that have been diagnosed with malignant neoplasm of breast.<br \/>This work lay basis for future investigations on big genetic data. We found a small genetic difference between women who have recurrent breast tumors and those who do not have recurrent tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-07 Genomics and proteomics in cancer risk and response assessment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Prevention,Recurrence,Genetic susceptibility,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yasaman Fatapour<\/b><sup><\/sup>, James Brody<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Biomedical Engineering, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2b2366b0-8e26-486f-8129-bed277334d6e","ControlNumber":"369","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Most patients are diagnosed at late stages due to asymptomatic disease and lack of effective screening modalities. Additionally, in women with an ovarian mass the diagnosis of ovarian cancer can be challenging with many women having surgery only to discover a benign pathology. Liquid biopsies, including analyses of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentomes in the circulation, have shown promise for the early detection of cancer and may provide a useful avenue for detection of ovarian cancer.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>To evaluate cfDNA fragmentomes for detecting ovarian cancer, we assessed plasma from 507 women, including 128 with ovarian cancers comprising high grade serous, endometrioid, mucinous and clear cell subtypes, 48 with benign masses, and 223 without cancer, as well as a validation cohort of 108 women with (n=14) and without (n=94) ovarian cancers from a separate institution. We obtained cfDNA from each individual and performed low-coverage (1-2x) whole genome sequencing. The cfDNA fragmentome data were analyzed with our DELFI (DNA evaluation of fragments for early interception) approach optimized for high specificity. We used a cross-validated machine learning model, and the fixed DELFI model was evaluated in the external validation cohort.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Individuals with ovarian cancer had significantly higher DELFI scores than those without cancer (mean 0.59 vs 0.18, respectively, p &#60; 0.0001) resulting in an AUC of 0.85 (95% CI = 0.80-0.90). DELFI was successful in identifying high-grade serous ovarian cancer across all stages, with sensitivities of 56%, 60%, 58% and 100% for stages I - IV, respectively, at 99% specificity. We further applied DELFI to evaluate women with ovarian masses in a prospective observational cohort (NL58253.031.16). Women with benign masses had DELFI scores lower than those with ovarian cancer (mean 0.23 vs 0.59, p&#60; .0001) and were distinguished with an overall AUC of 0.80 (95% CI = 0.73-0.86). In the external validation cohort, women with cancer were distinguished from women without cancer with an AUC of 0.88 (95% CI = 0.72 - 1.0). At the DELFI score threshold with 99% specificity in the cross-validated cohort, the external validation cohort had specificity of 97% with an overall sensitivity of 79%. The cfDNA fragmentome profiles reflected chromosomal, chromatin, transcription factor binding site, and disease-specific pathway changes known to be altered in ovarian cancer. We are extending these efforts to over 1000 individuals with and without ovarian cancer and the integrated results will be presented.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Overall, we demonstrate the utility of cfDNA fragmentomes for noninvasive detection of ovarian cancer.

These exhibit cribriform morphology, a finding associated with poor prognosis. In addition to the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene, TP53, RB1, and PTEN deletions and HRR gene mutations, such as a BRCA mutations, are frequently detected in patients with IDCP. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines suggest that early genetic testing should be considered. However, IDCP recognition is notably low, and diagnosis requires skill.<br \/>Methods: Among 1026 cases who underwent total prostatectomy for prostate cancer at our hospital between 2011 and 2021, we selected 98 cases with \"prostate cancer with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) in the background\" by referring to the pathology reports. Twelve cases which were considered suggestive of IDCP were reviewed by three pathologists to determine the presence of IDCP. Additionally a gene test of prostatectomy specimens was submitted for the relevant cases to determine the presence or absence of HRR gene mutations.<br \/>Results: Five of the twelve cases were determined to be IDCP positive. Characteristics of the five cases are shown in the table. Pathology genetic testing identified HRR-related genetic abnormalities, including BRCA mutations.<br \/>Conclusions: We were able to establish IDCP cases from past high-grade PIN cases. As a number of <i>HRR<\/i> gene mutations of unknown pathological significance were detected, IDCP cases could be retrieved from past cases and genetic abnormalities could be identified efficiently. The findings of the study provide a possible approach to diagnose prostate cancer cases with genetic mutations at an early stage.

A better understanding of the oncogenic\/immune programs underlying progression may reveal exploitable targets for patients (pts) at high risk of progression and aid new intervention strategies. We designed a longitudinal Observational prospective Research study In monoclonal Gammopathies leadINg to myeloma (ORIGIN) to collect well-annotated, longitudinal samples (sps) for integrative genomic\/transcriptomic analysis.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b><b><\/b> Pts were accrued meeting MGUS\/SMM IMWG definition. BM sps were partitioned into CD138-positive and -negative compartments and DNAs\/RNAs extracted for bulk RNA and whole-exome sequencing (WES). Matched germline controls were included for somatic mutation and DNA copy number analysis. A number of tools and algorithms were applied, and the data were thoroughly analyzed and integrated.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> From 12\/2015-03\/2022, 249 pts were accrued and 205 eligible (99 MGUS\/106 SMM). Median follow up time is 33 months (6-49 months). As of 11\/2022, 21 pts progressed (prog) on ORIGIN study (14% 15\/106 SMM, 3% 3\/99 prog to SMM from MGUS and 1% 3\/205 to AL amyloidosis). To increase analytic power, genomic data of 166 SMM baseline sps from SMM pts on treatment studies were added. Altogether, genomic data of 496 sps were analyzed. Briefly, WES was performed on 170 sps from 150 pts and RNA-Seq was performed on enriched tumor\/TME cells in 326 sps from 187 pts. Relative to MGUS, we observed higher mutation load in SMM and more frequent somatic mutations in known drivers of myeloma: KRAS (14% vs. 2%), NRAS (7% vs. 2%) leading to a shorter time to myeloma as well as genes recurrently mutated in other cancers: <i>FOXO3<\/i> (7% vs 0%). We observed increased aneuploidy levels in SMM vs MGUS and in prog vs. non-prog including both gains and losses of multiple chromosomes. Transcriptome analysis of CD138+ cells revealed clearly distinct expression profiles between SMM and MGUS, and between prog and non-prog. The pathway activity of oxidative phosphorylation and MYC was significantly increased in SMM vs. MGUS and in prog vs. non-prog, suggesting their potential roles in driving progression. We noted a greater degree of heterogeneity in TME cell compositions in SMM vs MGUS sps and in prog vs. non-prog: ie, SMM and prog sps formed multiple distinct clusters exhibiting differential abundance of cytotoxic T cells, neutrophils, fibroblasts and myeloid cells.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Together, our integrative analysis of genomic and transcriptome data in ORIGIN demonstrates extensive changes in both CD138+ cells and the immune microenvironment and co-evolution of the ecosystems during disease progression. This study is an invaluable resource and lays the molecular foundation for the community for future biomarker and target discovery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-07 Genomics and proteomics in cancer risk and response assessment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Whole exome sequencing,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Minghao Dang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chutima Kunacheewa<sup>2<\/sup>, Hans C.

High mammographic density (MBD) is an independent risk factor for invasive breast cancer. Given that MBD is altered by endogenous and exogenous factors, its temporal changes may impact future breast cancer risk, but this is poorly studied, particularly among high risk BBD patients. In this study, we examined whether MBD changes following a BBD diagnosis were associated with subsequent breast cancer risk.<br \/>Methods: We conducted a case-control study within a cohort of 15,395 women aged 18-86 years who were members of the Kaiser Permanente Northwest Region health care system, had a diagnosis of BBD between 1970 and 2012 and were followed through mid-2015. Cases (n=261) were BBD patients who developed invasive breast cancer at least one year after the index BBD diagnosis. Controls were matched (1:1), on age at BBD diagnosis and health plan membership duration and did not develop breast cancer during the follow-up duration. Standardized change in percent MBD per 2 years, categorized as an increase (&#8805;0%), stable\/minimal decrease (-5%&#60; to &#60;0) or decrease (&#8804;-5%), was determined from baseline (pre-biopsy) and follow-up (prior to breast cancer diagnosis for cases or matched selection date for controls) mammograms, using computer-assisted software. Associations between MBD change and breast cancer risk overall and stratified by BBD diagnosis age and histology were determined using unconditional logistic regression adjusted for matching factors and other covariates.<br \/>Results: At BBD diagnosis (median age (range)=54.6 years (32.4, 86.6)), 64.5% (n=329: n=151 cases and n=178 controls) of women had non-proliferative and 35.5% (n=181: n=110 cases and n=71 controls) had proliferative BBD with or without atypia. Compared to women with stable\/minimal MBD decrease, those who experienced a decline &#8805;5% per 2 years were less likely to develop breast cancer (odds ratio [OR]: 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38, 1.07). However, among women aged &#8805;50 years at BBD diagnosis, an MBD decrease\u0009&#8805;5% was significantly associated with reduced breast cancer risk (OR: 0.48; 95%CI: 0.25, 0.92), with the protective effect most apparent for those with proliferative (OR: 0.32; 95%CI: 0.11, 0.99) versus non-proliferative (OR: 0.70; 95%CI: 0.30, 1.64) BBD.<br \/>Discussion: Temporal MBD declines were associated with reduced risk of subsequent breast cancer particularly among BBD patients aged &#8805;50 years and with proliferative BBD diagnoses. These findings suggest that monitoring MBD may be useful in determining risk and that strategies to actively reduce MBD may be helpful in reducing breast cancer risk among high-risk BBD patients.<br \/>Funding: Dr. Rohan is supported in part by the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF-22-140).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-15 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast density,Breast cancer,Benign breast disease,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maeve Mullooly<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Shaoqi Fan<sup>2<\/sup>, Ruth  M.

Despite significant efforts, current approaches suffer from high false-positive rates or limited sensitivity. There is a critical need for non-invasive, cost-effective technologies that detect the early changes in lung carcinogenesis with high sensitivity and specificity. Abnormal chromatin structure is one of the hallmarks of cancer cells and is independent of molecular pathways making it an attractive target for early cancer detection. In this study, we assessed the use of super-resolution stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) to detect abnormal heterochromatin disruption in lung carcinogenesis. First, utilizing a mouse model of tobacco carcinogen (NNK)-induced lung adenocarcinoma, we analyzed heterochromatin structure in the lungs of NNK-treated mice at 8, 15 and 20 weeks post-NNK exposure together with non-treated control mice at the same time points. Super-resolution images of NNK-induced lung lesions at all time points showed significant disruption of condensed heterochromatin nanodomains compared to normal alveolar epithelial cells from the control mice, consistent with our data from other tumor types. Importantly, the normal-appearing bronchial epithelial cell nuclei from NNK-treated mice also showed significant heterochromatin disruption in NNK-treated mice at 15 and 20 weeks (<i>P<\/i>&#60; 0.0001), demonstrating that this method can detect early changes. Next, we sought to confirm this in humans. Super-resolution imaging showed that, compared to normal alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells from control subjects without cancer, the heterochromatin structure was more disrupted in tumor cells from patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). We also observed significant disrupted heterochromatin structure in tumor-adjacent normal tissue at the tumor margin. Lastly, we performed a pilot study on bronchial epithelial cells isolated from sputum samples from 11 cigarette smokers with or without lung cancer. The heterochromatin structure in the bronchial epithelial cells collected from lung cancer patients at the time of diagnosis was significantly more disrupted than those from smokers without lung cancer (<i>P<\/i>= 0.004).

Additionally, the level of aberrant signal originating from clonal expansion (CE) in precursor conditions, such as monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), is not well understood. To characterize CE in a potential screening population, we profiled samples from non-cancer (NC) participants and compared them to samples from participants with hematological precursor and neoplastic conditions (HPNCs).<br \/>Methods: Using LymphoTrack IGH FR1 Assay (Invivoscribe, Inc), we sequenced DNA derived from WBCs from a subset of enrollees in the Circulating Cancer Genome Atlas study (NCT02889978) comprising NC participants, balanced for age and gender, and participants diagnosed with an HPNC (chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL], multiple myeloma [MM], MBL, or MGUS). Additional samples were titrated and processed to determine the limit of quantification (LoQ).<br \/>Results: Using 12 titration samples, we determined the LoQ of detecting an unknown clone against a polyclonal background to be 0.1% of the total reads. The threshold used to determine evidence of CE was 2.5% of the total reads.<br \/>We sequenced samples from 112 individuals, 67 of whom were NC participants (35 male of median [range] age 67 [33-85] years; 32 female of 60 [30-85] years). A large fraction of NC samples (10\/67; 15%) showed evidence of CE: 9\/10 (90%) were monoclonal with clonal percent total reads (PTR) ranging from 2.7% to 80.4% (median: 6.0%), and 7\/9 had a mutation rate &#62;2%, indicating somatic hypermutation (SHM). One sample exhibited oligoclonality with 2 clones (6.6% and 3.2%), and both had SHM. Most NC samples (57\/67; 85%) lacked evidence of CE: median top clone PTR of 0.10% (mean: 0.18%; SD: 0.24%) and median Simpson clonality of 0.0021 (mean: 0.0030; SD: 0.0030). A positive correlation between the top clone PTR and age was also observed (&#9076;=0.41 all participants, &#9076;=0.43 excluding 80.4% PTR).<br \/>All CLL samples (9\/11 monoclonal; 2\/11 oligoclonal) and 3\/4 MBL samples showed evidence of CE. Consistent with the observation that a limited number of plasma cells are expected to be in circulation, only 3\/10 MM samples and 7\/20 MGUS samples showed evidence of CE; 1 MM and 3 MGUS samples had a top clone PTR of &#62;40%.<br \/>Conclusion: A large fraction of NC samples (15%) had evidence of expanded lymphoid clones with SHM. The PTR of the top clone underscores the higher frequency of CE associated with increased age in asymptomatic participants. Clonal expansion of blood cell lineages can also carry genetic or epigenetic alterations that are similar to those associated with non-hematologic cancers. Thus, differentiating aberrant signals originating from various hematologic compartments is key for accurate early cancer detection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-15 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Early detection,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jing Xiang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Qinwen Liu<sup><\/sup>, Rita Shaknovich<sup><\/sup>, Oliver Venn<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>GRAIL, LLC, a subsidiary of Illumina, Inc., currently held separate from Illumina, Inc. under the terms of the Interim Measures Order of the European Commission dated 29 October 2021, Menlo Park, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"27ac9391-d03c-4546-8607-c20af038e60f","ControlNumber":"3884","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

However, despite the multitude of future applications, challenges regarding the sensitivity of analytical tests remain, thereby limiting the routine use of ccfDNA within the above mentioned fields. In this study, we investigated the compatibility of the PAXgene<sup>&#174;<\/sup> Blood ccfDNA Tube and the QIAcuity<sup>&#174;<\/sup> Digital PCR System as an optimal &#8220;sample to insight&#8221; workflow with regard to the detection of EGFR T790M mutations spiked into apparently healthy human donor blood specimens.Methods: Blood from 22 apparently healthy consented donors was collected into PAXgene Blood ccfDNA Tubes* (PreAnalytiX). Within 2 h of blood draw, blood samples were either spiked with an EGFR-Multiplex 5% AF cfDNA standard (SensID) containing an EGFR T790M mutation or left unspiked as a control. Tubes were incubated for 3 d at room temperature to simulate transport over a weekend and plasma was generated by double centrifugation. Plasma pools were generated from spiked and unspiked samples and ccfDNA was isolated with the QIAamp<sup>&#174;<\/sup> Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (QIAGEN). CcfDNA quantity was measured by Qubit<sup>&#174;<\/sup> dsDNA HS Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and fragment size distribution was determined by TapeStation<sup>&#174;<\/sup> Cell-free DNA ScreenTape<sup>&#174;<\/sup> (Agilent Technologies). EGFR T790M mutation detection was performed using the dPCR Mutation Assay EGFR 6240 Human (QIAGEN) with a 26K 24-well Nanoplate (QIAGEN) on the QIAcuity Digital PCR System (QIAGEN). Data analysis was conducted using the QIAcuity Software Suite (QIAGEN).<br \/>Results: CcfDNA isolated from PAXgene Blood ccfDNA Tubes had a fragment size distribution profile with distinct mononucleosomal peaks at ~180 bps without high-molecular weight DNA, indicating successful nucleated cell stabilization over the simulated transport duration and extraction of high-quality ccfDNA. Digital PCR analysis of extracted ccfDNA revealed positive detection of EGFR T790M mutations in spiked blood samples at a relative mutation fraction of approximately 2% in the investigated samples.<br \/>Conclusion: PAXgene Blood ccfDNA Tubes enabled high-quality ccfDNA isolation by stabilizing nucleated cells during simulated transport condition. Spiked EGFR T790M mutations were successfully detected by dPCR following sample storage. This proof of principle study shows the combined usability of both systems for mutation detection in human blood specimens, highlighting the potential of both technologies for a broader application in the liquid biopsy field to detect oncogenic driver as well as tumor suppressor gene mutations in a multitude of tumor types. *The PAXgene Blood ccfDNA Tube is for Research Use Only in the US.

We have previously shown that a KC polygenic risk score (PRS) effectively triages OTRs for KC risk, with 50% of transplantees with high genetic risk developing KC within 3 years of follow up. However, readiness for clinical application of the KC PRS, its application to triage OTRs in the clinic and the return of the genetic risk information have not yet been assessed.<br \/>Objectives: 1) To evaluate patients&#8217; readiness to receive genetic risk information for KC risk stratification in a lung transplant clinic. 2) To assess whether returning the PRS results to patients influences skin cancer screening, incidence, and sun protection behavior.<br \/>Methods: We recruited 100 lung transplantees from the Prince Charles Hospital in Queensland into the ASCOT prospective study. We assessed their attitude, knowledge, and perceptions of genetic testing for KC risk stratification. We also collected genetic data. We developed a KC risk stratification pipeline, and triaged the transplantees. PRS results and KC prevention advice were returned to the high risk group. All transplantees are being followed-up for sun protection and screening behaviors, and skin cancer outcomes.<br \/>Results: 50% of OTRs were highly likely to accept genetic testing for KC risk stratification. Following transplantation, there was a drastic change in the perception of KC risk and severity, and the majority of transplantees considered it a major health concern. Using the PRS pipeline, 40 patients were triaged into the high risk category for KC, and received their PRS results and health advice, and we are prospectively assessing whether this will influence skin cancer screening rates, skin cancer incidence, and sun protection behavior in this group. Findings will be shared.<br \/>Conclusion: There is positive patient-readiness to receive genetic risk information for KC risk stratification among transplantees. High-risk patients are currently being followed-up for KC outcomes and prevention service uptake including screening, and sun protection behaviors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-01 Application of molecular pathology in clinical prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Cancer risk,Keratinocytes,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mathias Seviiri<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Matthew  H.

However, MRD is a single-site BM-derived assay and is conceptually limited due to the spatially heterogenous nature of MM and response to treatment.<br \/><b>Objective:<\/b> We investigated if the evaluation of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) can be utilised as an adjunct to MRD analysis in predicting patient outcome.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Peripheral blood plasma was obtained at baseline (B), cycle 3 day 1 (C3D1) and end of study (EOS)\/relapse from a phase II, multicentre single arm study of carfilzomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone (KTd) in 50 transplant-eligible newly diagnosed MM patients who were refractory to or had demonstrated a suboptimal response to first-line therapy. Extracted ctDNA was assessed utilising high-sensitivity targeted amplicon sequencing (TAS) of 22 MM-relevant genes. The variant allele frequency (VAF) of mutations at B was utilised to calculate a fold change in VAF at C3D1 and\/or EOS. A negative fold change was defined as a decrease in VAF (ctDNA-) and a positive fold change an increase in VAF (ctDNA+) with the average fold change across all mutations calculated for each patient. Euroflow<sup>TM<\/sup> was performed on BM obtained pre and post-autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and at EOS and the &#8216;best MRD response&#8217; achieved (MRD+ or MRD-) was recorded.

A single blood-based screening tool that detects multiple cancer types could greatly reduce cancer burden. We aim to systematically review and statistically examine both the accuracy and applicability of blood-based MCED tests to strategize their utilization in improving cancer detection.<br \/>Methods: Original articles were searched from Pubmed, Cochrane, and Embase for blood-based screening tests analyzing multiple cancer types and asymptomatic human subjects. We excluded studies with small sample size (n&#60;30), hypothesis-generating tests, and non-blood based tests. For cell-free DNA (cfDNA) based assays, measurements of diagnostic accuracy were pooled for meta-analysis.<br \/>Findings: Of 1,074 records screened, 10 case-control and 6 cohort studies were analyzed, most of which utilized cfDNA-based diagnostic tests. Ten cfDNA studies selected for meta-analysis had a joint sensitivity of 0.66 (95%CI 0.54-0.75) and specificity of 0.98 (0.94-0.99) with an area under the curve of 0.883. For cohort studies, the joint positive and negative predictive values were 0.96 (0.29-1.00) and 0.81 (0.37-0.97) respectively. Sensitivity was higher for advanced staged cancers (III\/IV 0.84 (0.84-0.86)) with breast cancer having the lowest sensitivity (0.42 (0.31-0.55)). Sensitivity and specificity were not affected by study type, gender, or assay type. Lastly, accuracy of tumor origin prediction was 0.792 (0.64-0.91) without significant differences across cancer types.<br \/>Interpretation: Given high sensitivities and specificities, MCED tests show promise as additional screening tools. Although there exist multiple barriers to their application in clinic, MCED tests may improve patient outcomes for cancers with no conventional screening tools.

We aim to systematically review and statistically examine the accuracy of tumor of origin prediction among blood-based MCED tests.<br \/>Methods: Original articles were searched from Pubmed, Cochrane, and Embase that featured blood-based screening tests, multiple cancer types, and asymptomatic human subjects. We excluded studies with small samples (n&#60;30), non-screening tests, and non-blood-based tests. For cell-free DNA (cfDNA) based assays, measurements of diagnostic accuracy were pooled for meta-analysis.<br \/>Findings: Of 1,074 records identified and screened, 4 cohort studies were analyzed using cfDNA-based diagnostic tests. The accuracy of tissue-of-origin (TOO) prediction for 3,762 cancer samples across cancer types was 0.79 (95% CI 0.64 - 0.91). Among six cancer types, colorectal cancers had the highest accuracy, and liver &#38; bile duct cancers had the lowest, although the difference was statistically insignificant (0.89 (95% CI 0.79-0.97) vs. 0.68 (95% CI 0.40-0.90)). Additionally, cases were most frequently misclassified as colorectal cancer (Table 1). Lastly, two studies reported increased prediction accuracies when two sites of origin were assigned rather than a single site. The information for localizing TOO was derived from methylation patterns of cfDNA in two studies, fragmentation profiles of cfDNA in another study, and protein markers in the other research.<br \/>Interpretation: Our results demonstrate that the primary site of cancers was accurately discerned in 79% of cases by MCED tests. However, the performance varies across cancer types. Further research on performance according to cancer stages and in combination with other molecular profiling is warranted.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{578435DE-B1DD-4F71-A5AB-C2FE638A2677}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">Events\/Total<\/td><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">Accuracy of prediction (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">misclassification <\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">type<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">freqeuncy<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Total<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3,129\/3,762<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.79 (0.64 - 0.91)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">Colorectal<\/td><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">638\/723<\/td><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">0.89 (0.79 - 0.97)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">stomach &#38; esophagus<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">26\/553<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">breast<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8\/553<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\" colspan=\"1\">Breast<\/td><td rowspan=\"3\" colspan=\"1\">443\/538<\/td><td rowspan=\"3\" colspan=\"1\">0.86 (0.64 - 0.99)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">colorectal<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">20\/349<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">pancreas &#38; GB<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4\/349<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">lung<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4\/349<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">Ovarian Breast<\/td><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">132\/159<\/td><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">0.85 (0.62 - 0.99)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">colorectal<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">39\/261<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">uterus<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13\/147<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">Pancreatic &#38; GB<\/td><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">289\/338<\/td><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">0.82 (0.69 - 0.93)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">colorectal<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">12\/300<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">stomach &#38; esophagus<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">10\/300<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">Stomach &#38; Esophagus<\/td><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">225\/311<\/td><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">0.75 (0.48 - 0.95)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">colorectal<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">39\/261<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">lung<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">10\/261<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">Lung<\/td><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">530\/656<\/td><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">0.72 (0.45 - 0.92)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">colorectal<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">29\/560<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">head and neck<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8\/560<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">Liver &#38; Bile duct<\/td><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">95\/144<\/td><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">0.68 (0.40 - 0.90)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">colorectal<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13\/220<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">pancreatic &#38; GB<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8\/220<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"5\">Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; GB = gallbladder<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-15 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer detection,Cell-free DNA,Early detection,Molecular diagnosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Youjin Oh<sup>1<\/sup>, Joo Hee Park<sup>1<\/sup>, Liam Il-Young Chung<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Richard Duan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Trie Arni Djunadi<sup>1<\/sup>, Sung Mi Yoon<sup>2<\/sup>, Zunairah Shah<sup>3<\/sup>, Chan Mi Jung<sup>1<\/sup>, Ilene Hong<sup>1<\/sup>, Leeseul Kim<sup>4<\/sup>, Horyun Choi<sup>5<\/sup>, Young Kwang Chae<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Northwestern Univ.

When diagnosed early, the 5-year survival rate for OSCC is 64%, but two-third of these lesions are diagnosed in later stages, leading to lower survival rates (&#60;40%). Clinical diagnosis of these lesions is complicated by benign and Oral-Potentially-Malignant-Disorders (OPMD) like oral lichenoid conditions (OLC), mimicking OSCC in clinical presentation. Studies in literature demonstrate high rates of incorrect chair-side diagnosis for OSCC and OPMD, making their early and accurate detection challenging. This clinical gap prompts a strong need for clinical chair-side point-of-care (POC) platforms, to aid accurate screening of these lesions and prevent diagnostic delays.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In this work we present a &#8216;smart diagnostic approach&#8217; that combines three key capabilities into an integrated sensing modality as follows: i) powerful microfluidic engine that allows for cytology measurements to be completed outside of a sophisticated lab infrastructure, ii) cytomics platform that allows for single cell molecular imaging to be completed in a portable analyzer, iii) AI-linked diagnostic models for early disease detection using cyto-signatures. This platform has been clinically validated across a multi-site prospective clinical study.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Multiple parameters including cellular phenotypes, nuclear parameters, biomarker expressions were indexed. Further, combining these features allowed discrimination and stratification of these lesions with high accuracy (99.3%) and significance. Further examination using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses yielded significant lesion identifiers and AUC values towards positive discrimination of OLC and OSCC (0.824 and 0.95, respectively vs benign lesions), with high sensitivity and specificity.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> This rapid (&#60;30 minutes) cytopathology POC solution has the potential to impact OSCC and OPMD screening accurately, characterizing subtle cellular changes to aid long-term monitoring of these lesions.

Epigenetic characterization of cell free DNA (cfDNA), specifically DNA methylation, is an emerging approach for sensitive detection and quantification of tumor burden. For breast cancer detection from blood, existing approaches for testing cfDNA have demonstrated a low performance in identifying affected patients. For this study, we developed a new approach that overcame this issue. Addressing the challenge of detecting breast cancer from cfDNA, this new approach relied on single-molecule methylation profiling of cfDNA. We used nanopore single molecule sequencing to provide quantitative characterization of cfDNA methylomes. This study determined if this approach provided the methylation features required for detecting the presence of breast cancer. The study population consisted of an extended cohort (~200 with untreated breast cancer and ~400 healthy controls). We identified 5mC-specific profiles from the nanopore sequencing signals of cfDNA. Importantly, this approach did not require any biosulfite or biochemical processing steps for determining methylation. Thus, we determined methylation profiles that were directly extrapolated from native cfDNA at single molecule resolution. Our results from this study demonstrated higher sensitivity of detecting breast cancer compared to other cfDNA methylation tests. We developed a new analytical framework for characterizing the methylation profiles of individuals with breast cancer compared to healthy individuals. Using a supervised bootstrapped algorithm, we identified CpG sites that were differentially methylated between the case and control groups. Afterwards, we calculated the similarity of any sample&#8217;s methylation profile to a training data. Our method also accommodates sparse and missing data. Based on separate validation datasets, we accurately identified those individuals with breast cancer. We validated our study with a different, independent cohort of healthy controls and individuals with breast cancer. Overall, this study demonstrates that a nanopore-based cfDNA sequencing and methylation profiling detects breast cancer from blood with higher performance then has been previously reported.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-15 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Methylation,Diagnosis,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Billy  T.

We applied sampling weights to account for the complex survey design to generate population estimates and conducted weighted descriptive statistics and logistic regression models.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Overall, there were an estimated 1,559,137 LCS-eligible respondents from 16 US states in 2019 (AZ, ID, KY, ME, MN, MS, MT, NC, ND, PA, RI, SC, UT, VT, WV, WI), 200,301 LCS-eligible respondents from five states in 2020 (DE, ME, NJ, ND, SD), and 668,359 LCS-eligible respondents from four states in 2021 (ME, MI, NJ, RI). Among 2,427,797 LCS-eligible adults, 254,890; 38,875; and 122,240 individuals reported receiving LCS in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Overall, 16.4% (95% CI 14.4-18.5), 19.4% (95% CI 15.3-24.3), and 18.3% (95% CI 15.6-21.3) received LCS during 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. In all years, the proportion of LCS use was higher among adults aged 65-74, insured, those with fair and poor health, lung disease and history of cancer (other than lung cancer). In 2020, a higher proportion of adults living in urban areas reported receiving LCS compared to those living in rural areas (20.36% vs. 12.7%, p=0.01). Compared to non-Hispanic White adults, the odds of receiving LCS was lower among Hispanic adults and higher among Non-Hispanic American Indian\/Alaskan Native adults in 2020 and 2021, respectively.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>LCS uptake remains low in the US. An estimated 2,011,792 adults at high-risk for developing lung cancer did not receive LCS during 2019, 2020 and 2021. Efforts should be focused to increase LCS awareness and uptake across the US to reduce lung cancer burden.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-15 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Screening,Early detection,Prevention,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hermine Poghosyan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sayantani Sarkar<sup>1<\/sup>, Ilana Richman<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>School of Nursing, Yale University, New Haven, CT,<sup>2<\/sup>School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"38635ce4-18d3-4c6b-8062-4d56bd17d554","ControlNumber":"6944","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

Analysis of abnormalities in cfDNA methylation is an emerging and powerful strategy for early cancer detection. Recently, targeted methylation NGS methods have shown encouraging performance in CRC detection, but their high cost and complicated workflow can be challenging for many clinical settings. At the same time, the alternative, single methylation biomarker PCR assays, demonstrate limited sensitivity and specificity. An accurate, accessible and affordable assay ideal for clinical applications requires an easily scalable set-up and a set of high quality biomarkers providing sufficient predictive power. We aim to develop an assay fulfilling the CMS definitive performance guideline of LBx CRC screening &#8211; at least 74% sensitivity and 90% specificity.<br \/>Here we report the development of a novel multiplex methylation-specific qPCR (MMS-qPCR) strategy for early CRC detection. Previously, we established detailed methylation profiles of our proprietary CRC targeted methylation sequencing panel with 560 biomarkers, based on more than 500 plasma samples of both healthy controls and CRC patients of various stages. We selected 9 biomarkers that are both highly sensitive and specific for CRC. These 9 markers show methylation signatures prevalent in patients and have very low noise in healthy controls. Along with one reference gene, the 9 CRC hypermethylated biomarkers can be multiplexed and analyzed in a single methylation-specific qPCR reaction.&nbsp; Analytical sensitivity and specificity were determined using a model system where hypermethylated DNA molecules were spiked into normal cell free DNA background at various percentages.&nbsp; With 10 ng of input, we can detect a single copy of the hypermethylated genome, achieving 0.006% limit of detection.&nbsp; Plasma samples from 10 stage I and 11 stage II CRC patients as well as 104 age-matched control subjects were subjected to the PCR analysis to yield a specificity of 96% and detection rate of 50% for stage I and 81% for stage II. The total turnaround time for analysis was &#60;4 hours including DNA isolation,&nbsp; bisulfite conversion and qPCR analysis.&nbsp;<br \/>The MMS-qPCR described here provides an accurate, accessible, and affordable liquid biopsy assay for the early detection of CRC. The same development strategy can also be applied to many other cancer types.&nbsp;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-15 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Early detection,Cancer detection,Liquid biopsies,ctDNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yun Bao<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Heng Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Peter Vu<sup>2<\/sup>, Grace Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, Shengrong Lin<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Avida Biomed Inc., Fremont, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>UCSD, San Deigo, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"633a3888-4062-4755-9a91-17de599ed4b5","ControlNumber":"8123","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;Y.
