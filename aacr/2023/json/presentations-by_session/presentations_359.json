[{"Abstract":"Background: <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations occur in ~30% of NSCLC and <i>KRAS G12C <\/i>is the most common subtype (~40%). Co-mutations can impact NSCLC prognosis and tx response.<br \/>Methods: This retrospective study used the nationwide (US-based) de-identified Flatiron Health-Foundation Medicine clinico-genomic database (FH-FMI CGDB; January 1, 2011 to March 31, 2022). De-identified data originated from ~280 US cancer clinics (~800 sites of care). This study is based on tissue-based assay (FoundationOne CDx). Pts were aged &#8805;18 years; had <i>KRAS G12C<\/i>-mutated, advanced\/metastatic NSCLC, and had received &#8805;1 line of tx, with 1L tx initiated after October 1, 2016. Pts were categorized by presence (m) or absence (wt) of single co-mutations in <i>STK11<\/i>, <i>KEAP1,<\/i> or <i>TP53<\/i>; pts<i> <\/i>with <i>EGFR<\/i>, <i>ALK<\/i>,<i> ROS1<\/i>, <i>BRAF<\/i>, <i>MET,<\/i> or <i>NTRK<\/i> alterations were excluded. Key endpoints included overall survival (OS) and real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS). Statistical methods included a univariate Cox hazard model.<br \/>Results: Among 847 pts with <i>KRAS G12C<\/i>-mutated NSCLC, co-mutations of <i>STK11<\/i> were seen in 24%,<i> KEAP1<\/i> in 14%, and<i> TP53<\/i> in 51%. Based on non-missing records (82%), low tumor mutational burden (&#60;10 mut\/Mb) was more frequent in the <i>STK11<\/i>m vs wt group (72% vs 55%; p&#60;0.001), not significantly different in the <i>KEAP1<\/i>m vs wt group (53% vs 60%; p=0.145), and less frequent in pts with <i>TP53<\/i>m vs wt (50% vs 69%; p&#60;0.001). Negative PD-L1 status (&#60;1%) was more frequent in pts with <i>STK11<\/i> (50% vs 18%; p&#60;0.001) or <i>KEAP1<\/i> (41% vs 23%; p&#60;0.001) mutations, and less frequent in pts with <i>TP53<\/i> mutations (15% vs 37%; p&#60;0.001). <i>STK11<\/i> or <i>KEAP1<\/i> co-mutations were associated with shorter rwPFS and OS, particularly in pts treated with immunotherapy (IO)-based 1L tx (Table 1). <i>TP53<\/i> status did not significantly impact pt outcomes in the 1L setting.<br \/>Conclusions: In this real-world analysis, <i>STK11 <\/i>or <i>KEAP1<\/i> co-mutations were associated with PD-L1-negative tumors and poor outcomes with IO-based tx in<i> KRAS G12C<\/i>-mutated NSCLC.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{95D32A5C-292C-4035-AC86-D1D6B1900E8E}\"><caption>Table 1. rwPFS and OS by co-mutation status, and OS by 1L treatment and co-mutation status<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"8\"><b>rwPFS and OS by co-mutation status<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>rwPFS<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>All<\/b> <b>(N=846)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b><i>STK11<\/i><\/b><b>m<\/b> <b>(n=206)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b><i>STK11<\/i><\/b><b>wt<\/b> <b>(n=640)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b><i>KEAP1<\/i><\/b><b>m<\/b> <b>(n=121)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b><i>KEAP1<\/i><\/b><b>wt<\/b> <b>(n=725)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b><i>TP53<\/i><\/b><b>m<\/b> <b>(n=429)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b><i>TP53<\/i><\/b><b>wt<\/b> <b>(n=417)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Median, months (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5.0<br>(4.5-5.7)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4.0&nbsp;<div>(3.1-4.9)<\/div><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5.6&nbsp;<div>(4.9-6.2)<\/div><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3.8&nbsp;<div>(2.7-4.8)<\/div><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5.6&nbsp;<div>(4.7-6.2)<\/div><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5.3&nbsp;<div>(4.6-6.1)<\/div><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4.7&nbsp;<div>(4.0-5.7)<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">HR (95% CI);

Given the rarity of the HVs, very little is known about their treatment and chemosensitivity. The benefit of chemotherapy (CT) is unclear in hormone receptor-positive HER2 negative (HR+) subtype in the mucinous, medullary, cribriform, and papillary HVs in the NCCN guidelines. We aim to study the benefit of CT in these BC histologies.<br \/>Method: We queried the SEER database from 2010-2018 for stage I, II, and III HR+ BC patients (pts) with mucinous, medullary, cribriform, and papillary histologies and examined their overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). Pts with metastatic disease and carcinoma in situ were excluded. The population was divided into two cohorts based on the receipt of adjuvant CT (CT positive (CT+) and CT negative (CT-) groups (gps)). Mann Whitney U and Fisher&#8217;s Exact test were used to compare continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Multivariate cox regression models were used for studying the association of CT with OS and DSS, controlling for confounding variables such as surgery, radiation, stage, grade, race, age, sex, and lymph node status. All analyses were conducted in RStudio v4.0.2 at a significance level of 0.05.<br \/>Results: In the mucinous histology, out of a total of 11,745 pts, 94% (n= 6,788) were HR+. Among them, 8.5% (n= 580) were CT+ and 91.5% (n= 6208) were CT-. The 5-year (yr) OS was higher for CT+ compared to CT- among all stages (Stage I: 99% vs 92%, HR= 0.12; II: 96% vs 84%, HR= 0.22; III: 94% vs 40%, HR= 0.08, all p&#60;0.001). The benefit of CT in 5-yr DSS was observed only in stage III (96% vs 73%, HR= 0.2, both p&#60;0.001).<br \/>In the medullary histology, out of a total of 1,787 pts, 34% (n= 265) were HR+. Among these HR+ BC, all stage III pts received CT and their 5-yr OS was 94%. In stages I and II, CT+ had better 5-yr OS compared to CT- gp, (stage I: 99% vs 90%, p= 0.03, HR= 0.12, p= 0.07; II: 96% vs 91%, p= 0.03, HR= 0.23, p= 0.05). No 5-yr DSS benefit with CT was observed in any stage.<br \/>Out of the total 1,110 BC pts with cribriform histology, 93% (n= 617) were HR+. Among them, 13.2% (n= 82) were CT+. The 5-yr OS was higher in CT+ compared to CT- in stage II (98% vs 82%, p=0.02, HR= 0.2, p= 0.036), but not in stage I or III. 5-yr DSS was not significantly better with CT in any stage.<br \/>In the papillary histology, out of the total 1,698 pts, 83% (n= 889) were HR+. Among them, CT+ had better 5-yr OS compared to CT- only in stage II (86% vs 78%, p= 0.04, HR= 0.46, p= 0.047). There was no statistically significant DSS benefit with CT at any stage.<br \/>Conclusion: In this large retrospective study, we observed that in mucinous and medullary histologies, adjuvant CT has OS benefit in HR+ BC subtype. In HR+ papillary and cribriform histologies, CT can be considered in higher stages. Multicenter clinical trials would be beneficial to assess the impact of CT in HVs and to formulate guidelines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Chemotherapy response,Histopathology,Survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Arya Mariam Roy<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Syed Maaz Abdullah<sup>2<\/sup>, Kayla Catalfamo<sup>1<\/sup>, Kristopher Attwood<sup>1<\/sup>, Shipra Gandhi<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY,<sup>2<\/sup>University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"08150506-68a4-434a-a788-1b51db72b7ca","ControlNumber":"3991","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

HRRm are estimated to be present in up to 28% of patients (pts) with advanced prostate cancer, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Testing for HRRm may inform treatment choice in pts with mCRPC. The aim of the study was to assess HRRm testing rate and describe pts factors associated with testing in treated mCRPC pts.<br \/>Methods: We identified pts with mCRPC on treatment from 5\/1, 2020 through 3\/31, 2022 from the Integra Connect PrecisionQ de-identified database, an electronic medical record (EMR) and claims database of US cancer pts in community oncology. We defined HRRm testing as the receipt of any test for alterations in 1 or more of the following genes: BRCA 1\/2, ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, RAD54. We described age and race at diagnosis (dx), cancer stage and Gleason score at staging, and line of therapy (LOT), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, metastatic sites and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values at date closest to mCRPC diagnosis. Categorical data were reported as counts and percentages, and continuous data were summarized as medians (IQR).<br \/>Results: The study cohort comprised 798 pts (HRRm tested, n=389, 48.7%). Most pts were white (81.7%), with a median (IQR) age of 68 (54-82) years at dx. Most pts had high-grade mCRPC, with Gleason scores of 7-8 (43.3%) or 9-10 (47.9%). The majority of pts were stage IV (74.0%), and on their first LOT (44.6%) at mCRPC diagnosis. A higher proportion of pts &#8805;80 years were not HRRm-tested (61.5%) vs. pts &#8804;59 (46.6%). Compared to white pts, a higher proportion of black\/African American pts were HRRm non-tested (48.6% vs 41.5%). Tested pts had better ECOG status compared to non-tested pts (0 - 1: 91.0% vs 86.8%). 77.1% of tested pts had a bone metastasis compared to 73.4% of non-tested. A higher proportion of tested pts were diagnosed with mCRPC in a later LOT than those not tested.<br \/>Conclusion: We found a testing rate for HRRm of 49% in US mCRPC pts receiving routine care. There were modest unadjusted differences in demographic and clinical features between tested and non-tested pts. There is a need for further research to examine the value of HRRm testing in mCRPC pts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,BRCA1,BRCA2,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Simon Blanc, MD<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Gboyega Adeboyeje<sup>2<\/sup>, Liam Lee<sup>2<\/sup>, Mike Gart<sup>1<\/sup>, William Saunders<sup>3<\/sup>, Brandon Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Poras Dave<sup>1<\/sup>, Sandy English<sup>3<\/sup>, Prateesh Varughese<sup>3<\/sup>, Arthur Sillah<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Integra Connect, LLC, West Palm Beach, FL,<sup>2<\/sup>Merck & Co., Kenilworth, NJ,<sup>3<\/sup>PrecisionQ, Integra Connect, LLC, West Palm Beach, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3739a7f3-1efe-45ed-b2f8-1e79e56c7cde","ControlNumber":"3011","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

The reported incidence of <i>NRG1<\/i> fusions in solid tumors is ~0.1-0.3% with enrichment in invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma of the lung and <i>KRAS<\/i> wildtype pancreatic adenocarcinoma. However, the real-world incidence of <i>NRG1<\/i> fusions across diverse tumor types continues to evolve with the clinical implementation of comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods including RNA based NGS. The true diversity and prognostic significance of specific <i>NRG1<\/i> fusion partners has yet to be elucidated. We report on <i>NRG1<\/i> fusions from a large clinico-genomic database of patients (pts) in community-based oncology settings where NGS is ordered as standard clinical practice.<br \/>We conducted a retrospective, records-based analysis of pts across Sarah Cannon&#8217;s network of over 299 partner community-based oncology clinics to identify pts with <i>NRG1<\/i> fusions detected by commercial NGS testing ordered as a part of standard of care from 1\/1\/2017 - 7\/7\/2022.<br \/><i>NRG1<\/i> fusions were reported in 0.05% (19 of 40,857) of pts with commercial NGS test results across a range of tumor types including lung (59%; n=11\/19), pancreas (11%; n=2), breast (5%; n=1), colorectal (5%), esophageal (5%), endometrial (5%), soft tissue liposarcoma (5%), and carcinoma of unknown primary (5%). NGS identifying an <i>NRG1<\/i> fusion was performed in 5 (26%) pts with early stage disease while 11 (58%) pts had NGS testing after initial diagnosis of or progression to advanced\/metastatic disease. A majority of pts harboring <i>NRG1<\/i> fusions were female (68%; n=13).<br \/><i>NRG1<\/i> fusions were detected by DNA (58%; n=11) and RNA based (42%; n=8) NGS from liquid (5%; n=1) and tissue biopsies (95%; n=18). A total of 11 different fusion partners were reported. <i>CD74<\/i> was the most prevalent fusion partner and was primarily detected by DNA NGS including in one pt from liquid biopsy. Five novel, as yet to be described, fusion partners (<i>CDK13<\/i>, <i>IL1RL2<\/i>, <i>FUT10<\/i>, <i>PPP2R2A<\/i>, <i>PIM3<\/i>) were detected - 3 by RNA sequencing and 2 by DNA sequencing of <i>NRG1<\/i> (versus sequencing of the fusion partner). <i>TP53<\/i> (42%; n=8), <i>CDKN2A<\/i> (32%; n=6), and <i>MTAP<\/i> (16%; n=3) were the most frequently co-altered genes. Other notable co-altered genes included mutations in <i>PIK3CA<\/i> (11%; n=2), <i>BRAF<\/i> (5%; n=1), <i>EGFR<\/i> (5%), <i>ALK<\/i> (5%), and <i>NRAS<\/i> (5%). Immune biomarkers were largely negative, with 16% (n=3) PD-L1 positive, 0% MSI-high, and 5% (n=1) TMB-high cases.<br \/>These data highlight the importance of comprehensive molecular profiling for pts with solid tumors, as <i>NRG1<\/i> fusions occur across tumor types and stage of disease. Appropriate test selection is paramount as novel <i>NRG1<\/i> fusions are more robustly detected by RNA over DNA NGS and are more routinely detected in tissue over liquid biopsies. Clinical trials investigating therapies to target NRG1 fusions are ongoing [CRESTONE (NCT04383210); eNRGy (NCT02912949)].","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Fusion genes,NRG1,real-world data,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Emma  G.

Databases containing clinical\/genomic variables were built-up. BC was estimated using the measurement of adiposity (e.g., Whole body Adipose Tissue [WBAT]) and muscle mass (Lumbar muscle area to vertebral body at L4-level, [PLVI]) by CT-scan. A list of 425 genes linked to obesity and lipid metabolism was used to identify clusters using non-negative matrix factorization. GSEA, Gene Ontology, KEGG pathways enrichment, and Ecotyper analyzes were also made. Survival curves and Cox-regression models were also built-up. Results: We identified four BC types and two clusters that, unlike BMI, effectively correlate with survival regardless of achieving optimal debulking or complete response. Mention deserves central sarcopenia, which was associated with worse survival in any condition. So also, that recovering a normal BC and adding medications to correct metabolism disorders (e.g., statins) could have a positive impact on outcomes. Along with this, we showed that micro-environments depleted of immune cells predominate in HGSOC, something more evident in the BC type (High WBAT\/Low PLVI) and cluster (Obesity\/Lipid Metabolism Type I) with worse prognosis. Conclusions: Here, we demonstrate the relevance of BC and lipid metabolism disorders in determining therapeutic responses and long-term outcomes. Also, the importance of incorporating corrective measures addressing these disorders to obtain better results.

Limited data exist on the prognostic impact of <i>KRAS G12C <\/i>in NSCLC<i>.<br \/><\/i>Methods: This retrospective study used the nationwide (US-based) de-identified Flatiron Health-Foundation Medicine Clinico-Genomic Database (FH-FMI CGDB; January 1, 2011-March 31, 2022). De-identified data originated from ~280 US cancer clinics (~800 sites of care). Patients (pts) were aged &#8805;18 years; had advanced (adv)\/metastatic NSCLC; and had received 1L treatment (tx) initiated on or after October 1, 2016. Pts with <i>EGFR<\/i>, <i>ALK<\/i>,<i> ROS1<\/i>, <i>BRAF<\/i>, <i>MET<\/i>, or <i>NTRK<\/i> alterations were excluded. Key endpoints were overall survival (OS) and real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS). Propensity score matching and a multivariate Cox hazard model were used.<br \/>Results: Analyses included pts with <i>KRAS G12C<\/i> (n=847)<i> <\/i>and<i> KRAS<\/i> wild-type (WT; n=2679) NSCLC. In comparison to WT<i>, <\/i>pts with<i> KRAS G12C <\/i>were more likely to be female (56% vs 40%), former\/current smokers (97% vs 93%), have non-squamous disease (91% vs 52%), have Stage IV disease at initial diagnosis (64% vs 56%), have brain metastases (22% vs 16%), have low (&#60;10 mut\/Mb) tumor mutational burden (59% vs 51%), and have high (&#8805;50%) PD-L1 expression (43% vs 23%). Overall, 39% of <i>KRAS G12C<\/i>, and 33% of WT received chemo (CT) + immunotherapy (IO) as 1L tx. More pts with <i>KRAS G12C<\/i> vs WT did not receive 2L tx (61% vs 54%). No significant differences were seen in rwPFS and OS between <i>KRAS G12C<\/i> and WT (Table 1). In pts receiving 1L CT + IO (n=1218), pts with<i> KRAS G12C<\/i> had shorter rwPFS compared with pts with WT (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.22; p=0.04). In<i> <\/i>pts with <i>KEAP1 <\/i>or <i>STK11<\/i> mutations, co-mutation with <i>KRAS G12C<\/i> was associated with shorter OS.<br \/>Conclusions: Pts with<i> KRAS G12C <\/i>and WT had similar overall prognosis; however, those with <i>KRAS G12C <\/i>had worse rwPFS with CT + IO tx, as opposed to a trend in the opposite direction for pts treated with IO mono. <i>KRAS G12C<\/i> imposed worse prognosis vs WT in pts with <i>STK11<\/i> or <i>KEAP1<\/i> mutations.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{50ED26BB-1190-4C86-A1BB-C6D4607D1593}\"><caption>Table 1.

Estimates of the frequency of NTRK gene fusions and knowledge about characteristics of affected patients from population-based settings are limited.<br \/>Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study using archival tissue samples from patients with histologically-confirmed solid tumors identified from the Auria Biobank in the Turku region of Finland (January 2005-December 2019). We evaluated all solid tumor types in pediatrics, and selected tumor types in adults (colorectal cancer [CRC], non-small cell-lung cancer [NSCLC], sarcoma, and salivary\/parotid cancer). Expression of TRK protein was determined by pan-TRK immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of tumor samples scored by a certified pathologist. NTRK gene fusion including fusion partners was then confirmed by next generation sequencing (NGS). Patients&#8217; demographics, clinical characteristics, and survival status were determined through linkage to hospital electronic health records and the national vital statistics database; patients were followed from 1 year before cancer diagnosis until the end of follow-up\/death.<br \/>Results: NTRK gene fusion frequency and descriptions of patient and tumor characteristics are shown in the Table. The number of patients confirmed as NTRK positive after NGS as a proportion of those deemed NTRK positive after IHC staining was 80% (8\/10) for CRC, 5% (1\/21) for NSCLC, 6% (1\/18) for salivary\/parotid cancer, 0% (0\/21) for sarcoma, and 25% (4\/16) for pediatric solid tumors.<br \/>Conclusions: This study shows that NTRK gene fusions are rare in adult CRC, NSCLC, parotid\/salivary tumors, sarcoma, and pediatric solid tumors.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{C4900D90-A1A3-4E69-BDD8-3F0F95560317}\"><caption>Frequency of NTRK gene fusion in pediatric and select adult solid tumors, and characteristics of NTR<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><span lang=\"ES\" style=\"font-size:11.0pt;line-height: 107%;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;

Thymoma A and AB have a better prognosis than more aggressive thymoma B, thymic carcinoma (TC) and neuroendocrine tumors of the thymus (NET). While previous efforts such as TCGA have mainly characterized thymomas (Radovich et al., Cancer Cell 2018), the molecular landscape of TCs and NETs is still elusive.<br \/>Patients and Methods: Between 03\/2014 and 07\/2020, we enrolled 44 TET patients (27 TCs, 11 thymomas, 6 NETs) in a prospective observational study (MASTER) conducted by the National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Heidelberg, NCT Dresden and the German Cancer Consortium (DKTK). MASTER applied whole genome\/exome sequencing (WGS, n=22; WES, n=22), transcriptome (n=40) and germline analysis to inform therapy recommendations by a dedicated molecular tumor board (MTB). We systematically gathered follow-up data to evaluate outcome and compared progression-free survival (PFS) of the first treatment according to an MTB recommendation (PFS2) to the last prior systemic treatment (PFS1) in each patient (PFS ratio).<br \/>Results: Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was low (median=0.99 mutations\/Mb, range 0.08-3.48) but higher than in TCGA (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05). TMB was higher in TCs than in thymoma (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05). Most frequently mutated genes were <i>TP53<\/i> (30%), <i>CYLD<\/i> (16%), <i>SETD2<\/i> (14%) and <i>KIT<\/i> (14%). Germline analysis revealed (likely) pathogenic germline alterations in 25% of patients (<i>MUTYH<\/i>, n=3; <i>BRCA1<\/i>, n=2; <i>BRCA2<\/i>, <i>BAP1<\/i>, <i>CHEK2<\/i>, <i>FANCA<\/i>, <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>MEN1<\/i>, n=1). A comprehensive analysis of candidate biomarkers of homologous recombination repair (HRR) defects revealed a subgroup of TET patients with a rationale for PARP inhibitor therapy. Unsupervised clustering of RNA sequencing data mainly revealed clustering that correlated with WHO classification. Additionally, TCs clustered in two subgroups that we identified as immunologically hot and cold tumors using immunohistochemistry validation. Overall survival of patients with hot tumors was significantly longer (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05). The MTB recommended therapies for 42 patients (95%), which were implemented in 24 cases (57%). Five patients had a PFS2 &#62; 6 months and a PFS ratio &#62; 1.3. The best outcome was achieved using imatinib in a patient with a <i>KIT<\/i> mutation (p.W557R). After progression, the MTB recommended ponatinib based on a secondary <i>KIT<\/i> mutation (p.V654A). The patient was still on ponatinib when the observation period ended.<br \/>Conclusion: We demonstrate that comprehensive molecular analysis provides clinically relevant information in a subgroup of TET patients. Thymoma, TCs, and NETs present with different molecular characteristics. Distinction between immunologically hot and cold TCs may have value for risk stratification and therapeutic strategies. PARP inhibition could be a potential new treatment option in a small subgroup of TETs. Molecular testing of <i>KIT<\/i>, germline analysis and genetic counseling should be recommended for all patients with advanced TETs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Molecular profiling,Genomics,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lino Möhrmann<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lysann Rostock<sup>1<\/sup>, Ma&#322;gorzata Ole&#347;<sup>2<\/sup>, Arne Jahn<sup>3<\/sup>, Marie Arlt<sup>3<\/sup>, Nagarajan Paramasivam<sup>2<\/sup>, Korinna Jöhrens<sup>4<\/sup>, Luise Rupp<sup>5<\/sup>, Marc Schmitz<sup>5<\/sup>, Daniela Richter<sup>1<\/sup>, Sebastian Uhrig<sup>2<\/sup>, Martina Fröhlich<sup>2<\/sup>, Barbara Hutter<sup>2<\/sup>, Jennifer Hüllein<sup>2<\/sup>, Elena E.

In normal cells, these transmembrane proteins TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC, are activated by four neurotrophins, i.e., NT3, NT4, nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), with high specificity and affinity to specific TRKs. Somatic fusions of NRTK genes have been observed in rare and several common types of cancer with varying prevalence. In this type of molecular alternation, the fusion protein mediates a ligand-independent tropomyosin kinase activity thus promoting constitutive cell proliferation. Highly effective first-generation TRK inhibitors such as Larotrectinib or Entrectinib, are associated with high response rates, and those patients who develop resistance are often given second-generation TRK inhibitors such as LOXO-195. That said, the knowledge associated with <i>NTRK<\/i> fusions, their gene partners, mechanism of developing resistance, and treatments are quickly evolving. For example, there are 40-50 ongoing clinical trials that has patients with <i>NTRK<\/i> fusions as an inclusion criterion. Moreover, given the different rates at which screening is done for gene fusions in patients with common cancers, a real-world analyses of patient diagnosis, procedures, treatments, and responses, categorized by care setting will be highly useful for care providers, as well for drug makers in designing clinical trials.Complementary to the individual large cohort studies, real-world data offers promise to fill in some of the gaps that might exist in characterizing a patient population, especially for newly discovered ones. Insights gained from using such data will supplement knowledge of KOLs and are likely to improve design of patient-centric trials. In addition, not having a holistic view of the patient population might lead to missed opportunities in catering to a segment of patients who might otherwise have benefitted from the therapy. In this presentation we focus on understanding cancer patient population better, especially those with gene fusions such as <i>NTRKs <\/i>through use of real-world data. We derive this through integration of structured de-identified patient data from an oncology diagnostic lab, claims and EHR using the cutting-edge Datavant tokenization technology. Overall, we characterized &#62;1300 patients with fusion genes, and ~50 patients with <i>NTRK<\/i> fusions. We also compare the results on treatments, procedures, lab tests, and survival with published results from cBioPortal. We will present our findings with preliminary data, describe the data sources used, outline the technologies leveraged, and conclude with lessons learned.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fusion genes,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Chemotherapy,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sivakumar Gowrisankar<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jason Gagner<sup>1<\/sup>, Martin Keywood<sup>2<\/sup>, Angela Qu<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>PAREXEL International Corp.

Characterizing associations of actionable gene mutations with microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) could suggest mechanistically intriguing combinations of targeted and immunotherapies.<br \/>Methods: Publicly available genetic and overall survival (OS) data of patients with colorectal cancer were analyzed. (N=3,548, MSK-MET through cBioPortal for cancer genomics) We investigated the correlations among actionable gene mutations (BRAF V600E, KRAS G12C, HER2 amplification, NTRK fusion, and RET fusion), MSI and TMB (&#62;20 \/Mb). The association of actionable mutations, MSI and TMB patterns with OS was analyzed.<br \/>Results: BRAF V600E, KRAS G12C, HER2 amplification, NTRK fusion, RET fusion, MSI and TMB &#62;20 was observed in 6.9, 3.1, 2.8, 0.3, 0.2, 9.2 and 9.9%, respectively. BRAF V600E showed mutual exclusivity toward KRAS G12C and HER2 amplification. MSI and TMB &#62; 20 were associated with the presence of BRAF V600E, NTRK fusion, and RET fusion and the absence of KRAS G12C and HER2 amplification. MSI and TMB &#62; 20 were highly correlated. (Table) Among patients with MSI (N=316), BRAF V600E was associated with shorter OS. (Hazard ratio (HR) 2.22, 95% confidence interval (CI); 1.12 - 4.41) In the patients without MSI, TMB &#62;20 showed significantly longer OS, compared with TMB &#8804;20. (HR 0.26, 95% CI; 0.085 - 0.82) Association of NTRK or RET fusion with survival could not be reliably assessed due to small sample size (n &#60; 10 for both).<br \/>Conclusion: There is significant correlation among targetable genetic mutations, MSI and TMB in colorectal cancer, and biomarker profiles are associated with differences in OS. Future studies should evaluate whether combinations of targeted therapies and immunotherapy have better efficacy than monotherapy approaches in selected patients.<br\/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{866219D4-6973-4027-9E66-2A0765C4ECE9}\"><caption>Correlation among actionable gene mutations and immunomic signatures (OR and 95 % CI)<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">KRAS G12C<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">HER2 amp<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NTRK fusion<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">RET fusion<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MSI<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TMB &gt;20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">BRAF V600E<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>0 (0 - 0.44) *<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>0 (0 - 0.49) *<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0 (0 - 6.79)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0 (0 - 9.31)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>10.0 (7.39 - 13.5) *<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>8.76 (6.52 - 11.7) *<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">KRAS G12C<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.31 (0.01 - 1.78)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0 (0 - 16.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0 (0 - 21.9)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>0.18 (0.02 - 0.67) *<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>0.16 (0.02 - 0.61) *<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">HER2 amp<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0 (0 - 17.5)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0 (0 - 23.9)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>0.10 (0.00 - 0.57) *<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>0.09 (0.00 - 0.51) *<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NTRK fusion<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0 (0 - 315)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>20.0 (4.25 - 124) *<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>18.4 (3.91 - 115) *<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">RET fusion<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>24.9 (4.06 - 261) *<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>23.0 (3.74 - 241) *<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">MSI<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>1.52 x 10<sup>4 <\/sup>(4.20 x 10<sup>3<\/sup> - 4.50 x 10<sup>15<\/sup>) *<\/b><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal,BRAF,Immunotherapy,Databases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hirotaka Miyashita<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Gabriel Brooks<sup>1<\/sup>, Razelle Kurzrock<sup>2<\/sup>, Shumei Kato<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Dartmouth Cancer Center, Lebanon, NH,<sup>2<\/sup>MCW Cancer Center, Milwaukee, WI,<sup>3<\/sup>University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bea510be-7672-4dfe-98ee-8c498bb0f877","ControlNumber":"2577","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

There is, however, a paucity of studies characterizing molecular alterations in premenopausal patients compared to postmenopausal ones in patients with breast cancer, but without any evidence of predisposition inherited mutations. We used molecular profiling of DNA and RNA using next generation sequencing (NGS) and evaluated the molecular differences between PreM and post-M breast cancers in patient without risk of predisposition to cancer. Case descriptions were collected by COTA, inc. This included 52 patients with breast cancer evaluated clinically at a referral cancer center (John Theurer Cancer Center, Hackensack, NJ, USA) and the DNA and RNA of their tissue samples were evaluated by Genomic Testing Cooperative using next generation sequencing (NGS) of a targeted panel of 1,408 RNA genes and 434 DNA genes. All patients were treated with standard of care therapy by subspecialized oncologists. Machine learning algorithm and Geometric Mean Na&#239;ve Bayesian (GMNB) were used to select RNA genes and distinguish between preM and postM cases. PreM patients showed lower cumulative survival proportion (P=0.03). TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3 mutations were the most common mutations in preM and postM patients. However, PTEN mutation was more common in preM cases. The machine learning system chose the expression level of 20 RNA genes (p=0.001) that distinguishes between preM and postM cases. The 20 genes are TCF7L2, C11orf30 (EMSY), ARIH2, MLH1, IRF2BP2, FGFR1OP, NFE2L2, EPC1, SOS1, MLLT4, IL13RA2, GIT2, MAP3K1, SF3B1, ERCC4, ADD3, CHUK, FRK, REEP3 and MAP2K6. The 20 genes were able to distinguish between preM and postM with area under the curve of (AUC) of 0.987 (95% Confidence interval of 0.947 to 1.00) (Figure), sensitivity of 93.8 and specificity of 97.1. Leave-one-out curve showed AUC of 0.893 (95% confidence interval of 0.783 to 1.00). TCF7L2, C11orf30 (EMSY), IRF2BP2, NFE2L2, EPC1 and FRK were highly expressed in preM cases with p values of 0.004, 0.008, 0.007, 0.019, 0.01 and 0.03, respectively. Together this data suggests that breast cancer in patients with no germline predisposition to cancer differ biologically in preM patients as compared to postM tumors and these differences should be considered in treatment and management plans of these patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,RNA,Machine learning,Molecular profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ahmad Charifa<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Andre Goy<sup>2<\/sup>, Andrew Pecora<sup>2<\/sup>, Deena Graham<sup>2<\/sup>, Donna McNamara<sup>2<\/sup>, Andrew Ip<sup>2<\/sup>, Wanlong Ma<sup>1<\/sup>, Maher Albitar<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Genomic Testing Cooperative, Irvine, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"120c38df-1d60-487c-990d-94b9abe20336","ControlNumber":"4155","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;A.

The index date was the initiation of a new therapy in this period, in patients who developed castration-resistant disease and progressed while receiving androgen deprivation therapy. Data on all available lines of therapy post-index were collected. Outcomes reported include time to treatment discontinuation for any reason (TTTD) and overall survival (OS), which were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analyses. Results for tumor response-related endpoints are forthcoming.<br \/>Results: A total of 138 patients with mCRPC met the inclusion criteria. The mean age at index was 68 years, and 76% of patients were White. The median follow-up time was 27.1, 15.9, 11.3, and 9.4 months for 1L, 2L, 3L, and 4L+ therapy, respectively. Common sites of metastases included bone (74%), lymph nodes (69%), and lungs (10%). Common tumor DDR mutations included <i>CDK12<\/i> (48%), <i>BRCA2<\/i> (23%), <i>ATM<\/i> (21%), and <i>BRCA1<\/i> (8%). Assessment of germline mutations was conducted in 114 (83%) patients; the most common was <i>BRCA2<\/i> (8%). First-line (1L) treatment information was available for 119 (86%) patients, 2L for 101 (73%), and 3L for 75 (54%) patients. Novel hormonal therapy (NHT; 55%) and taxane chemotherapy (20%) were most common in 1L. Enzalutamide (35%) and abiraterone acetate (14%) were the most frequently used NHTs. Compared to 1L, the proportion of patients receiving NHTs was lower in 2L (33%) and 3L (17%), while the proportion of patients receiving taxanes was higher (36% in 2L and 31% in 3L). In 3L, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors were used in 21% of patients. Median TTTD was 5.6 months (95% CI: 4.2, 7.2) in 1L, 3.9 months (95% CI: 3.0, 4.6) in 2L, and 4.0 months (95% CI: 3.3, 4.7) in 3L. Median OS was 36.3 months (95% CI: 30.7, 47.8) from the start of 1L, 21.1 months (95% CI: 15.6, 29.3) from the start of 2L, and 14.1 months (95% CI: 9.5, 20.5) from the start of 3L.<br \/>Conclusions: These findings provide real-world insights about treatment patterns and clinical outcomes among patients with mCRPC harboring DDR mutations. Such insight may provide a helpful benchmark for research aimed at improving clinical outcomes, particularly in later lines of therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Advanced cancer,Mutations,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"David  B.

A major barrier in the field has been the relative paucity of human tumors studied and lack of access to longitudinal samples to understand tumor evolution.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of 3,600 patients with SCLC who underwent targeted genomic profiling of at least 324 cancer-related genes as part of routine clinical care, including 678 cases with additional clinical and treatment information obtained from a US-based de-identified SCLC clinico-genomic database that originated from approximately 280 US cancer clinics. This large cohort allowed us to examine for new genetic subtypes, ancestry-associated genomic alterations, biopsy site-specific patterns, survival trends and histological transformation of SCLC from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Consistent with prior studies, SCLCs were predominantly <i>TP53\/RB1<\/i> altered. Yet, 5.5% of the cases in our cohort were <i>TP53\/RB1<\/i> wild-type tumors. These tumors often lacked a tobacco mutational signature, exhibited alternate mechanisms of p53\/Rb pathway inactivation (e.g., <i>CDKN2A<\/i>, <i>CCND1<\/i>, <i>MDM2<\/i>), and had a high fraction of human papillomavirus-positive cases (12.7%). Another rare subtype of SCLCs included <i>STK11<\/i>-altered tumors (1.7%), which were observed more frequently in patients of African ancestry, and were associated with a decreased overall survival (OS) compared with the <i>STK11<\/i> wild-type cohort. In our cohort, gene amplifications on 4q12 (<i>KDR<\/i>, <i>KIT<\/i>, <i>PDGFRA<\/i>) were associated with increased OS while <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplification was associated with decreased OS. Interestingly, alterations in <i>PTEN <\/i>were more common in brain metastases compared to lung biopsies and liver metastases, suggesting its potentially unique role in brain metastases of SCLCs. Profiling of over 100 putative transformed SCLCs demonstrated that lineage plasticity may occur at variable lengths of time from the original NSCLC diagnosis and include multiple distinct molecular cohorts of NSCLC, beyond <i>EGFR&#173;<\/i>-mutant NSCLC (e.g., kinase fusion+ tumors: <i>RET<\/i>, <i>ALK<\/i>, <i>ROS1<\/i>, <i>NTRK1<\/i>).<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Our work underscores the existence of genetic subtypes in SCLC, including rare subtypes with potential clinical utility. Findings from this study provide an improved understanding of genetic subtypes in SCLC and better inform mechanisms of transformation to SCLC from NSCLC, that may further guide the development of personalized therapies for subsets of patients with this fatal tumor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: small cell,Therapy resistance,Lineage plasticity,Targeted sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Smruthy Sivakumar<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jay  A.

Second line (2L) options include other EGFR TKIs, chemotherapy (C) and chemoimmunotherapy (C-IO). An optimal treatment strategy and utility of biomarkers in this 2L setting remain uncharacterized. In this study, we aim to describe the real-world treatment patterns and outcomes of patients with aNSCLC after treatment with first line (1L) EGFR TKIs to elucidate the potential for biomarker-guided approaches.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b>We selected patients with non-squamous aNSCLC treated with 1L EGFR TKIs on or after April 1, 2018 (based on 1L approval of osimertinib) within the US-based de-identified Flatiron Health-Foundation Medicine (FMI) real world clinico-genomic database. Real world overall survival (rwOS) and progression free survival (rwPFS) curves and estimates of median survival time were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method. PD-L1 and tumor mutational burden (TMB) were summarized overall and by 2L treatment regimen.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b>Among 428 patients who received 1L EGFR TKI treatment, 386 (90%) received osimertinib, 30 (7%) received afatinib and 11 (3%) received erlotinib. For patients with known 2L treatment information (n=139, 32%) most received EGFR TKI alone (n=43, 31%), followed by C-IO (n=38, 27%), and C alone (n=14, 10%). Median rwOS following 2L treatment with EGFR TKI, C-IO, and C was 21.0 (95% CI 17.4-28.7) months, 9.9 (95% CI 7.7-19.8) months, and 17.4 (95% CI 4.3-NA) months respectively. Median rwPFS for the EGFR-TKI, C-IO, and C cohorts was 5.1 (95% CI 3.4-12.5) months, 5.5 (95% CI 3.3-7.0) months, and 3.5 (95% CI 1.9-NA) months. 416 (97%) of 428 patients harbored an <i>EGFR<\/i> mutation detected by FoundationOne&#174;CDx, including 361 (84%) patients with at least one <i>EGFR<\/i> mutation in NCCN Guidelines. Among patients with available PD-L1 status (n=254, 59%), PD-L1 positivity (&#8805;1% tumor proportion score) was more common among patients who received 2L C-IO (88%) compared to patients overall (59%). 30 (7%) of 428 patients had high TMB (&#8805;10 mut\/Mb); prevalence of high TMB was similar regardless of 2L therapy choice.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b>This real-world data analysis confirmed that among patients with aNSCLC treated with EGFR TKIs, the vast majority received 1L osimertinib. Among 2L treatment options, additional EGFR TKI use was the most common and patients in this cohort had robust outcomes, with a median rwOS of 21 mos. Further analyses will describe the clinical characteristics of patients receiving different 2L treatment strategies and evaluate the association of PD-L1 status and select <i>EGFR<\/i> mutations with outcomes across therapeutic classes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,EGFR,Outcome,Anticancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ericka Ebot<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jie He<sup>1<\/sup>, David Fabrizio<sup>1<\/sup>, Ivy Altomare<sup>2<\/sup>, Neha Jain<sup>3<\/sup>, Davey Daniel<sup>4<\/sup>, Thomas Stricker<sup>4<\/sup>, Edward Arrowsmith<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Foundation Medicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Flatiron Health, Inc., New York, NY,<sup>3<\/sup>OneOncology, Nashville, TN,<sup>4<\/sup>OneOncology\/Tennessee Oncology, Nashville\/Chattanooga, TN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6177e573-19b5-43ae-a493-cd7b1308215d","ControlNumber":"6656","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;E.

Clinical trials in humans for new targeted therapies are often limited to approved use only as second- or third-line chemotherapies, complicating the ability to make conclusions about the efficacy of the drug alone. Pre-clinical trials in murine models with induced or xenograft tumors often fail to predict response in the intended human population. Several studies have qualified spontaneous tumors in dogs as important models for human cancers. Tumors in dogs are highly similar to human cancers histologically, genetically, molecularly and clinically, which provides an opportunity to investigate biomarkers and outcomes. Canine cancers progress over an accelerated timeline compared to human cancers due to several factors including differences in expected lifespan. Additionally, more flexibility exists in treatment options for canine cancers than in the more tightly regulated and standardized human care model. These key similarities and differences make dogs a powerful model for cancer research including interrogating the clinical benefit of new and existing cancer therapies. Over 3,500 dogs have enrolled into the FidoCure&#174; Precision Medicine Platform. Our current, ongoing studies use clinico-genomic data from dogs with cancer including those with na&#239;ve or early stage tumors as a tool to evaluate and inform clinical response to small-molecule targeted therapies, and our model allows for expansion into trials for additional, diverse therapy types. Using the FidoCure&#174; Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) panel, molecular targets are identified in canine tumors for treatment regimens with one or combinations of 12 small molecules approved for use in humans. Clinical information and outcomes data from participating dogs is collected and analyzed. In an unbiased, AI-driven analysis of our dataset, several significant prognostic findings with translational relevance included association of <i>TP53<\/i> mutations with worse prognosis (OS HR 1.48, P&#60;0.01) across 14 canine tumor types. Conversely, <i>ATM<\/i> and <i>KIT<\/i> mutations were associated with better prognosis (OS HR) of 0.51 and 0.43, respectively (P=0.01, P=0.02). We are now developing a tool called Fetch for real-time exploration of our dataset for use by external partners including clinicians and biopharmaceutical collaborators to visualize correlations between single or combinations of factors such as cancer type, breed, gene mutated, and treatment regimen with survival outcomes in our canine patient population. This tool can accelerate R&#38;D by making real-time, real-world data on thousands of dogs with translationally relevant disease available to clinicians and researchers looking to advance cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Databases,Precision medicine,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chase Schwalbach<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Lucas Rodrigues<sup><\/sup>, Garrett Harvey<sup><\/sup>, Dorothy Girimonte<sup><\/sup>, Gerald Post<sup><\/sup>, Lindsay Lambert<sup><\/sup>, Aubrey Miller<sup><\/sup>, Abigail Hull<sup><\/sup>, Christina Lopes<sup><\/sup>, Michelle  E.

This study aims to clarify the real-world data of CGP for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in Japan with particular attention to KRAS mutation and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status.<br \/>Method: 2568 PDAC patients enrolled in C-CAT from June 2019 to January 2022 were analyzed retrospectively. The clinical background, treatment outcomes and the detection rate of gene alterations such as Big4 genes (KRAS, TP53, SMAD4, CDKN2A) or other druggable genes, especially HRD genes, were evaluated. We defined it significant when genetic alterations are described as oncogenic\/pathogenic in C-CAT report.<br \/>Results: 85.7% and 14.3% of patients underwent tissue DNA sequence (FoundationOne (F1) CDx 62.9%, NCC OncoPanel 22.8%) and ctDNA assays (F1 Liquid), respectively. 70.3% of the analyzed tissue were obtained from the primary pancreatic lesions. Big4 genes mutations were most frequently prevalent such as KRAS (85.1%), TP53 (69.1%) and CDKN2A (35.4%). Big4 genes mutations were detected significantly more frequently in the tissue samples than in the liquid: KRAS (92.2% vs 42.1%) and TP53 (73.0% vs 45.6%). 16.1% of enrolled patients carried pathogenic variants related to HRD, such as ARID1A, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2 and BRCA1. Therapeutic agents were proposed in 27.6% of cases, the proportion of successfully treated patients eligible for targeted therapy was 2.6%. The median OS of KRAS-wild patients was prolonged than KRAS-mutated patients (65.4 vs 27.1 months, p&#60;0.001). The median TTF of BRCA1\/2 mutated patients who received FOLFIRINOX as a first line treatment was better than BRCA1\/2 wild patients (9.3 vs 5.6 months, p=0.025). Conversely, there was no difference between HRD and non-HRD (6.9 vs 6.5 months, p=0.25).<br \/>Conclusion: Detection rates of gene alteration vary widely between tissue and liquid samples. KRAS mutation is confirmed as a poor prognostic factor for PDAC and patients with BRCA1\/2 mutation are sensitive to FOLFIRINOX. Further accumulation of cases will help us to elucidate the more details of the relationship between gene alteration and therapeutic efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genome,Pancreatic cancer,Ras,Homologous recombination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Toshifumi Doi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Takeshi Ishikawa<sup>1<\/sup>, Tomoki Sakakida<sup>1<\/sup>, Ryuichi Morita<sup>1<\/sup>, Daiki Sone<sup>1<\/sup>, Junichiro Itani<sup>1<\/sup>, Seita Kataoka<sup>1<\/sup>, Hayato Miyake<sup>1<\/sup>, Masahiro Iwasaku<sup>2<\/sup>, Yoshio Sogame<sup>1<\/sup>, Hideyuki Konishi<sup>1<\/sup>, Koichi Takayama<sup>2<\/sup>, Yoshito Itoh<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3c788bf3-a81f-4e51-a146-dfe38d0b5829","ControlNumber":"3408","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

Despite advances in genomic technologies, there are few molecular biomarkers to guide precision medicine for high-grade glioma. Here, we aimed to identify the clinicogenomic features associated with its prognosis and recurrence patterns.<br \/>Materials\/Methods: Our single-institution retrospective analysis included 223 patients diagnosed with high-grade gliomas who underwent next-generation sequencing targeting 82 brain tumor-relevant genes. We categorized them according to the 2021 WHO classification, and their clinicopathological statuses, treatment characteristics, survival, and genomic profiles were analyzed.<br \/>Results: The most common genomic variants were <i>TERT<\/i> promoter (51%), <i>TP53<\/i> (39%), <i>IDH1\/2<\/i> (18%), <i>NF1 (13%), ATRX <\/i>(12%), <i>PTEN (<\/i>11%), <i>PIK3CA<\/i> (9%), <i>SETD2<\/i> (7%), and <i>H3F3A<\/i> (6%) mutation.

At a median follow-up of 18 months (range, 2-54 months), 174 patients (78%) had progression or recurrences. A total of 15.2% of our patients were re-classified under the 2021 WHO classification, and there was a clear separation of overall survival(OS) and progression-free survival(PFS) curves between grade 3 and 4 groups using the revised grading system. On multivariate cox regression analysis, MYCN amplification (HR 6.08, p = 0.002) and SETD2 mutation (HR 0.19, p =0.06) were independent predictors of OS and PFS.<br \/>Conclusion: The assessment of genomic characteristics in conjunction with the pattern of failure for high-grade glioma aids in identifying patients who are likely to benefit from personalized medicine. The 2021 WHO grading system explains survival differences between grade 3 and 4 tumors better than the 2016 WHO classification dose. We identified SETD2 mutation and MYCN as prognostic biomarkers with potential therapeutic implications in patients with high-grade glioma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioma,Glioblastoma,Genetic factors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Joo Ho Lee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Byung-Hee Kang<sup>2<\/sup>, Seungbok Lee<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Radiation Oncology, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Radiation Oncology, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Genomic Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"06fa0514-b9fd-472b-b4d8-e68090934297","ControlNumber":"588","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Real world overall survival (rwOS) was extracted from insurance claims and depicted using Kaplan-Meier survival curves for molecularly defined cohorts from tissue collection to last contact. Statistical significance was determined using chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests, with p-values adjusted for multiple comparisons (q&#60;0.05). <i>SPOP<\/i> mutations were identified in 601 (8.1%) and 655 (3.4%) samples of PCa and EC, respectively. Mutations clustered in the <i>SPOP<\/i> MATH domain with hotspots at residues F133L (21.4%), F102C (11%), F133V (10.4%), F102V (7%) in PCa, and residues M117V (21.8%), R121Q (10.6 %), E47K (9%), E50K (8.5%) in EC. Importantly, no overlap of hotspot residues was noted in PCa and EC. <i>SPOP<\/i>-mutated PCa had higher frequency of <i>APC<\/i> (21.4% vs 5.8%) and <i>BCOR<\/i> (1.95% vs 0.2%) lesions, but SPOP-mutated EC had higher frequency of <i>U2AF1<\/i> (4.28% vs 1.0%), <i>POLE <\/i>(5.24% vs 2.0%) and <i>CASP8<\/i> (4.17% vs 1.79%) lesions (all q &#60;0.05) compared to non-mutant <i>SPOP<\/i>. Analysis of epigenetic markers showed lower <i>BRD2<\/i> (245.4 vs 312 TPM) transcripts in <i>SPOP<\/i>-mutated PCa, but higher <i>BRD2 <\/i>(227.0 vs 200.6) (all q &#60;0.05) in <i>SPOP<\/i>-mutated EC, compared to non-mutant <i>SPOP<\/i>, the former diverging from earlier published data in PCa. Analysis of inferred immune cell infiltrates showed that in <i>SPOP<\/i>-mutated PCa, M1-M&#934; (36.8% vs 48.1%), CD8 T cell (20.2% vs 30.4%) and DC (53.3% vs 79.4%) are decreased and M2-M&#934; (100% vs 99.9%) are increased; while in <i>SPOP<\/i>-mutated EC, M1-M&#934; (87.2% vs 83.3 %), CD8 T cells (56.8% vs 49.7%) and DC (94.9% vs 93.3%) are increased and M2-M&#934; (98.8% vs 98.9%) are decreased (all q &#60;0.05). In PCa, higher AR expression was found in <i>SPOP<\/i>-mutated vs non-mutated tumors (98.5% vs 97.3%, p=0.09), with improved OS outcomes after hormone targeting agents leuprolide (2125 vs 1803 days; HR: 0.71, 95% CI (0.51-0.99), p=0.04) and bicalutamide (2538 vs 1854 days; HR: 0.57, 95% CI (0.41-0.79), p&#60;0.001). In EC, ER and PR expression was significantly lower in <i>SPOP<\/i>-mutated vs non-mutated tumors 50.8% vs 65.4% and 35.4 vs 49.5% (all q &#60;0.05), respectively, although no difference in OS was noted in the overall EC population.These data indicate that <i>SPOP<\/i>-mutations drive different molecular and immune microenvironments in PCa and EC, with apparently opposing roles in these malignancies, and provide a rationale for tailored therapeutic approaches in <i>SPOP<\/i>-mutated PCa and EC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenomics,Gene profiling,Prostate cancer,Endometrial cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ludimila Cavalcante<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sachin  K.

Gaps, however, remain in interpreting comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) results, and determining their actionability. Our MTB, established in October 2020 and conducted at a tertiary cancer center in Saudi Arabia, focused on discussing patients with complex CGP results and recommending genomic based therapies. Meetings occurred virtually, every month, with oncologists, pathologists and genomicists attending.<br \/>Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients discussed in our MTB from October 2020 till October 2022. We report the outcomes of these patients who had progressive disease on standard of care (SOC) therapies, and have had non Tier 1 alterations (ESCAT classification) in their CGP reports. We chose an FDA approved, commercially available CGP, which tests 324 genes (FoundationOne CDX). We present the demographics, clinical characteristics, CGP results, recommendations of the MTB, and patient outcomes.<br \/>Results: Sixty patients fitting the criteria above have been discussed. Median number of prior systemic therapy lines was 2 (range 0-8). The most common primary diagnosis was soft tissue sarcoma (25%), followed by liver and pancreato-biliary cancers (20%), followed by head and neck cancers (15%) and skin cancers (8%). Of the 60 patients, 48 patients had response evaluations. Thirty five patients (out of 48, 73%) have had recommendations for genomic based therapies based on their CGP results. Only 16 patients (out of 35, 46%) received MTB recommended therapies. Eight patients (out of 16, 50%) have remained progression free and on MTB recommended genomic therapy for 6 months and above. The commonest reasons for not receiving MTB recommended therapy were patient clinical deterioration or death (9 patients, 47%) followed by patients responding on current line of therapy (7 patients, 37%). Most common pathogenic targetable alterations were CDKN2A\/B mutations (6 patients), followed by alterations in FGFR (5 patients), PTEN (4 patients), BRAF (4 patients), PIK3CA (2 patients) and ERBB2 (2 patients) followed by others (will be presented).<br \/>Conclusion: Following recommendations, of the first MTB in Saudi Arabia, resulted in improved outcomes of cancer patients who had progressive disease on SOC therapies. Consideration of performing CGP and discussing patients early in their cancer journey may allow them to receive, and benefit from recommended genomic therapies earlier.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Molecular profiling,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Kanan Alshammari<sup>1<\/sup>, Fouad Sabatin<sup>1<\/sup>, Mehlika Hazar-Rethinam<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Faizah Alotaibi<\/b><sup>3<\/sup>, Reham Ajina<sup>3<\/sup>, Hussam Shehata<sup>1<\/sup>, Mohammad Alkhayyat<sup>1<\/sup>, Abdullah Alsaleh<sup>3<\/sup>, Mohammed Algarni<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs (MNG-HA), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,<sup>2<\/sup>Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA,<sup>3<\/sup>King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,<sup>4<\/sup>King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"597eeff5-10c8-4279-9295-f84ea002bec9","ControlNumber":"4560","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

Much of the molecular characterization relied on availability of tissue samples. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has emerged as a promising non-invasive approach for molecular profiling in lymphomas. In this study, we characterized the molecular features of PMBCL and cHL in the Chinese population utilizing both tissue-based and liquid biopsies.<br \/>Methods: Tissue and\/or plasma samples from a total of 35 PMBCL patients, 52 cHL patients and 81 DLBCL patients that were subjected to targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) using a 475 cancer-related gene panel were included in the analysis.<br \/>Results: Analysis of matched tumor and plasma samples from 38 cHL patients revealed 152 (28.10%) overlapping genetic alterations, with a higher number of mutations detected in the plasma compared to tissue (Total=472 vs. 221; Median=11 vs. 3 per patient, P&#60;0.01). Of these, 320 (59.15%) were unique to the plasma, whereas 69 (12.15%) were only found in the tissue. Mutant allele frequencies (MAFs) were also lower in the tissue than in the plasma, with a median of 1.71% vs 2.99% (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.01). In 18 PMBCL patients, who had paired plasma and tumor samples, similar number of genetic alterations were detected (Total=347 vs. 411; Median=19.5 vs. 21 per patient, P=0.09). Of these, 273 (56.29%) alterations were shared variants, 74 (15.28%) were unique to the plasma sample and 138 (28.45%) were unique to the tissue. MAFs were higher in the tissue compared with the plasma (23.35% vs. 8.78%, P&#60;0.01). Comparisons of mutational profiles among PMBCL, cHL, and DLBCL showed similar mutational profiles between PMBCL and cHL. The most frequently detected genetic alterations in PMBCL and cHL were <i>STAT6<\/i> (68.57% vs. 40.38%), <i>SOCS1<\/i> (57.14% vs. 57.69%), <i>ACTB<\/i> (48.57% vs. 23.08%), <i>B2M<\/i> (48.57% vs. 42.31%), and <i>TNFAIP3<\/i> (34.29% vs. 40.38%). On the contrary, the frequencies of <i>STAT6<\/i> (68.57% vs. 6.17%, <i>P<\/i> &#60;0.01), <i>SOCS1<\/i> (57.14% vs. 18.52%, <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.05), and <i>ACTB<\/i> (48.57% vs. 9.88%, <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.05) were markedly different comparing PMBCL and DLBCL. Meanwhile, the more common genetic alterations in DLBCL, such as <i>MYD88<\/i> (33.33% vs. 0.00%, <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.01), <i>BCL6<\/i> (33.33% vs. 11.43%, <i>P<\/i>=0.06), <i>BCL2<\/i> (20.99% vs. 2.86%, <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.05), and <i>CDKN2A<\/i> (24.69% vs. 2.86%, <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.05) were rarely detected in PMBCL patients.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings support that ctDNA in PMBCL and cHL may be an attractive source of genetic materials to assess tumor genomics and guide treatment decisions, especially in cHL with only 1% Hodgkin and Reed\/Sternberg (HRS) cells. We also demonstrate for the first time in the Chinese population that PMBCL and cHL shared comparable mutational profiles, which were different from that of DLBCL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma,Liquid biopsies,Gene profiling,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Xiaonan Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Lu Shen<sup>1<\/sup>, Liuqing Zhu<sup>1<\/sup>, Jiani  C.

Clinical and genomic features of MET&#916;ex14 in NSCLC remain to be further characterized.<br \/>Methods: A total of 556 baseline samples, 54 MET inhibitor-resistant samples and 16 EGFR\/ALK inhibitor-resistant samples from 586 MET&#916;ex14 NSCLC patients were included in the analysis. Tissue and\/or plasma samples were subjected to targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) using Geneseeq&#8217;s 139\/425 cancer-relevant gene panels.<br \/>Results: The overall frequency of MET&#916;ex14 was 1.1%, with a total of 266 distinct variants detected. Of these, 40.2% were base substitutions in the intronic non-coding region immediately adjacent to the splice acceptor site, followed by indels (25.6%) and base substitutions (4.5%) in the splice donor site, and indels (21.4%) and base substitutions (2.3%) in the splice acceptor site, etc. No associations with clinical features were found among different variants. At baseline, MET&#916;ex14 commonly co-occurred with <i>TP53 <\/i>mutations (40.8%), and <i>CDK4<\/i> (15.8%) and <i>MET<\/i> (7.9%) amplifications. In 42 (7.6%) patients, concurrent oncogenic mutations in <i>EGFR<\/i>, <i>KRAS<\/i>, <i>ALK<\/i>, <i>RET<\/i>, <i>BRAF<\/i>, and <i>ERBB2<\/i> were also detected. Such patients displayed a different spectrum of MET&#916;ex14 variants compared with those without concurrent oncogenic mutations (P=0.08). In patients treated with MET inhibitors, no difference in survival was seen among different MET&#916;ex14 variants (P=0.38). Notably, activation of <i>EGFR<\/i> or <i>MET<\/i> (kinase domain mutations\/amplification) conferred primary resistance to savolitinib and crizotinib. In addition, patients with high chromosomal instability or low intratumoral heterogeneity had unfavorable PFS. Secondary resistance to MET-TKI included <i>MET<\/i> activation (D1228N\/H, Y1230C\/S, amplification), <i>EGFR<\/i> activating mutations\/amplification, <i>KRAS<\/i> G12V, as well as <i>FGFR2<\/i>\/<i>4<\/i> amplification. Surprisingly, we identified a <i>FGFR3<\/i>-<i>TACC3<\/i> fusion as a previously unreported secondary resistance mechanism to savolitinib in the second line setting. Finally, we found that <i>MET<\/i> exon 14 skipping mutation might be a rare secondary resistance mechanism to EGFR\/ALK inhibitors.<br \/>Conclusion: In this study, we characterized MET&#916;ex14 in a large cohort of NSCLC patients and explored potential primary and secondary resistance mechanisms to savolitinib and crizotinib, which may facilitate drug development and help inform clinical actions. <b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET),exon 14 skipping,Gene profiling,Resistance mechanism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Xue Wu<sup>1<\/sup>, Yaru Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Jiaohui Pang<sup>2<\/sup>, Li Lin<sup>2<\/sup>, Jiani  C.

Data regarding disease-related events showed low median variance in the timing of first metastasis (0 months) and castration-resistance (-2.1 months), with substantial observed variance trending towards earlier event calling.<br \/>Longitudinal analysis of 2500 abstractions showed relatively stable completeness in staging data over time, suggesting that missing data is at least partially attributable to imposed restrictions in data source hierarchy rather than inexperience. Targeted retraining mid-way after 1300 annotations considerably increased the speed of data entry without noticeable changes in data completeness.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: Commercial data abstraction can be effectively utilized to perform clinical data annotation for large biospecimen repositories with acceptable levels of completeness and accuracy. With appropriate training and direct oversight by an experienced on-site research team, this represents a scalable method for extracting valuable clinical data from largely unstructured patient medical records.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Databases,Biomarkers,Biobank,Biospecimen,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Emily  A.

The test stratifies patients into two groups, HIC-H and HIC-C and helps evaluate patient prognosis and response to treatment. While much work has been done to evaluate the clinical validity of the HIC test, to date, no recent real-world studies have described healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and costs amongst patients utilizing the test. This subset analysis of HIC claims examined demographic and baseline clinical characteristics among patients with lung cancer using the HIC proteomic test as well as HCRU and costs prior to test use.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: This retrospective claims analysis utilized MarketScan&#174; Commercial and Medicare Supplemental Databases using data from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2021 linked to Biodesix data files of HIC test results. Patients were age 18 or older on index date (date of HIC testing), underwent a HIC proteomic test, were continuously enrolled in the MarketScan database for the 6-months before index (pre-index period), and had at least one non-diagnostic medical claim of lung cancer during the pre-index period. Clinical characteristics and HCRU and costs were measured per patient per month (PPPM) during the pre-index period and compared between HIC-H and HIC-C cohorts.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Of the 328 included patients, 260 patients were HIC-H and 68 were HIC-C. On index, 178 patients had non-metastatic lung cancer and 150 patients had metastatic lung cancer. When assessing lung cancer related comorbid conditions, significantly more HIC-C patients had empyema (3% vs 0%,<i> P<\/i>&#60;0.05) and pneumonia (34% vs 19%,<i> P<\/i>&#60;0.05). When examining HCRU in patients prior to the HIC test, significantly more HIC-C patients had an outpatient visit with an oncologist (40% vs 27%, <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.05) or a primary care physician (71% vs 56%,<i> P<\/i>&#60;0.05). Total costs and inpatient costs were higher amongst HIC-C patients ($10,299 vs $9,689 and $4,032 vs $3,218, respectively) although not significant. While fewer HIC-C patients underwent lung biopsy (41% vs 53%), HIC-C patients had significantly higher biopsy costs than HIC-H patients ($1,285 vs $400, <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.05). Although not statistically significant, more HIC-C patients had an inpatient admission (47% vs 38%) and longer average length of stay (5.3 vs 4.2 days).<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Patients with NSCLC who are identified as HIC-C have higher HCRU and costs, including lung cancer workup costs, prior to HIC testing.

However, outside of RCTs, patient assessments are not precisely timed, uniformly documented or manually curated, introducing difficulties in deriving cancer outcomes using real-world data (RWD). Novel informatics-based approaches to estimate cancer outcomes are needed to advance the use of RWD for facilitating rigorous cancer research. The goal of this study was to report on current methodologic approaches to measure (or approximate) real-world (RW) disease progression using lung cancer as an illustrative example.<br \/>Methods: A methodical literature review was conducted using PubMed to identify approaches to estimate\/approximate RW-progression among patients with lung cancer. Between 2008-2022, a total of 40 articles were identified relating to the estimation of lung cancer RW-progression. Data abstracted during the review included data source type, approach used to estimate RW-progression, and whether the RW-endpoints were compared to a gold standard, and how the gold standard was defined.<br \/>Results: Data sources used to estimate RW-progression within the various methods included clinical notes, medication information, pathology\/radiology reports, and radiological images. A total of five different methods to estimate RW-progression were identified from the search results, including studies reporting manual abstraction (n=17), treatment-based algorithms (n=6), natural language processing (n=4), algorithms based on changes in tumor volume (n=7), and radiomics (n=6). Comparisons of RW-progression endpoints to a &#8220;gold standard&#8221; were used by 50% of studies although the definitions of the gold standard varied across studies. As a final step, a comparison of the RW-progression endpoints will be presented.<br \/>Conclusions: A substantial amount of literature exists relating to methods for curating RW-disease progression in patients with lung cancer. However, comparison of methods and results across studies is challenging due to the lack of a consistent gold standard. Furthermore, no studies assessed a variety of methods within the same lung cancer patient population. Studies are needed that compare several methods within the same patient population in order to identify an optimal method for estimating RW-progression with high effectiveness and accuracy. Lastly, concerted efforts are needed to define a gold standard and quality metrics for RWD.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Outcome,Progression,real-world data,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Rossybelle  P.

The rise of liquid biopsies could potentially fill this unmet clinical need, such as our recently developed pancreatic LDT which isolates extracellular vesicles (EVs) from blood for detection of PDAC at earlier stages. In this case study, we describe a 60-year-old healthy male with acute pancreatitis who underwent an extensive imaging work-up that failed to detect radiographic evidence of lesions prior to surgery. Results from our EV-based early detection blood test, previously reported to have a specificity of 91.1% and sensitivity of 95.7% for stage I\/II PDAC, indicated a high likelihood of PDAC. Subsequent pathology review after Whipple surgery confirmed high-grade intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms (PanINs).<br \/><b>Case Description<\/b> The patient was brought to the clinic for persistent abdominal bloating and pressure. A CT scan of the abdomen and an elevated lipase yielded a diagnosis of first episode of acute pancreatitis. Two MRIs of the abdomen confirmed an abnormal pancreatic duct dilatation, but no evident masses. An endoscopic ultrasound later demonstrated an abrupt stricture of the pancreatic duct. Due to complete duct occlusion, an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed with stent placement. Cytology brushings from the ERCP were non-diagnostic, and CA-19-9 and CEA were non-elevated. The patient sought additional genetic analysis on his captured cyst fluid cells, which showed mutations in K-RAS and p53, raising clinical concern. Testing with a DNA-methylation test for cancer detection reported a result of &#8220;No Cancer Signal Detected&#8221;; however, blood testing with our EV-based early detection blood test indicated a high probability of PDAC. The patient decided to undergo a Whipple procedure. The final surgical pathology revealed a main-duct high-grade dysplasia IPMN with PanINs. Recovery post-surgery was unremarkable.<br \/><b>Discussion<\/b> This case report illustrates the successful clinical utility of an EV-based blood assay for detection of high-grade IPMN and PanINs, lesions not identified through extensive imaging workup lesion and destined, with high probability (~60-70%), to progress to a pancreatic cancer. The eventual impetus for this patient to undergo surgery was the combination of his known pancreatic duct pathology and other clinicopathological characteristics, with the results of the EV-based liquid biopsy test acting as an adjunct clinical tool to support to his decision.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b> PDAC is a lethal malignancy with a long-term survival of &#60;10%.

Since the seminal paper of Hartwell and colleagues has raised the possibility that SL can be used to devise highly selective cancer treatments, it has been one of the promising approaches for precision oncology and drug discovery. Many different avenues have so far been explored to bring this idea to the clinic. As 25 years have passed by now, we take stock and systematically and comprehensively chart the landscape of SL-based preclinical research and clinical trials.<br \/>Approach and Key Findings: We systematically mined both public and commercial databases to curate the preclinical and clinical landscape of the SL-based oncology studies. Our analysis shows that the number of SL oncology studies is rapidly growing since the first identification of the well-known BRCA-PARP synthetic lethality axis. Importantly, we find that the success rate of SL oncology trials is significantly higher than non-SL-based trials. While more than 70% of SL-oncology trials involve genes in the most-studied DNA damage response (DDR) pathways, the fraction of SL trials involving non-DDR pathways keeps growing since 2009. We further charted the landscape of SL triplets, which is a promising future higher-order extension of the conventional pairwise SL interactions. We find that only about 8% of preclinically validated SL triplets were clinically tested in trials, providing new opportunities for more refined clinical trial design. Our analysis suggests that emerging opportunities in SL oncology may arise from metabolic and paralogous interactions, disease-agnostic biomarkers, context-specific combinations against treatment resistance, artificial intelligence and data science approaches, and multi-omics patient stratification signatures.<br \/>Significance: Taken together, our findings testify that a considerable potential benefits of SL based approaches are yet untapped, reinforcing the belief that the synthetic lethality approach may serve as a key driver of precision oncology going forward.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-04 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synthetic lethality,Drug discovery,Biomarkers,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Joo Sang Lee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Youngmin Chung<sup>1<\/sup>, Ashwin  V.
