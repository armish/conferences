[{"Abstract":"<u>Background <\/u>PTEN loss of function is frequent in GBM correlating with poor prognosis, impaired antitumor responses and reduced efficacy of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI). Ipat is a potent, selective, small-molecule inhibitor of Akt. Ipat efficiently depletes FOXP3<sup>+<\/sup> regulatory T cells from the tumor microenvironment (TME) resulting in increased infiltration of effector T cells in solid tumors (Lopez 2020, AACR). We hypothesize that Akt inhibition in PTEN loss glioblastomas may deplete the TME of suppressive immune cells, and render malignant brain tumors more responsive to ICIs.<br \/><u>Methods <\/u>Relapsed WHO grade IV GBM pts with stable neurological symptoms &#8805;5 days prior to enrollment, requiring &#60;3mg Dexamethasone were recruited into a dose determination cohort (A2; n=12) and an expansion cohort (B3; n=11) of this early phase, open-label trial studying the combination of Ipat and A. Primary objectives were to determine the safety and tolerability of the combination (A2) and preliminary efficacy (B3).<br \/><u> <\/u><u>Results <\/u>23 recurrent GBM pts (median age 55 yrs (25-71 yrs; 74% male) were enrolled. Median ECOG PS 1. All pts had surgery followed by radical-chemoradiotherapy. Median prior lines of therapy 1 (range 1-4). 15 pts had PTEN loss by IHC (H&#60;30) indicative of biallelic loss of function, 1 had deleterious PTEN mutations detected by next generation sequencing. No DLTs, no significant treatment-related (TR) serious adverse events (SAEs), or immune-related AEs were observed. Most common TR AEs were G1-2 diarrhea (61%), rash (26%) and mucositis (22%). Clinical benefit rate (CR, PR and SD&#62; 6 cycles) in 19 efficacy evaluable pts was 32% (6\/19 overall) and 28.6% (4\/14) for pts with PTEN loss. Multiplex IHC of archival samples (n=19) showed PTEN loss tumors had significantly greater numbers of CD3+ infiltrating T-lymphocytes within the TME compared to PTEN wild type tumors (median 53.64\/mm2 vs 1.94\/mm2; p=0.0021). Within the PTEN loss cohort (n=13), pts with clinical benefit had significantly higher baseline number of CD8+ effector T cells as compared to non-responders (median 46.50\/mm2 vs 8.21\/mm2; p=0.0336). Two pts with PTEN loss proceeded to re-resection on trial. One exceptional responder, a 58yr male refractory to radical chemo-radiotherapy and Bevacizumab had a resection of enhancing disease after 5 cycles that showed &#62;70% depletion of CD4+ T regulatory cells with an increase in CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration and no residual evidence of tumor (pathological CR). In contrast, a non-responding patient who proceeded to debulking surgery had no change in infiltration of CD8+ lymphocytes, but a marked increase (&#62;27-fold) in CD4+ regulatory T cells.<br \/><u>Conclusion <\/u>The RP2D of 400mg Ipa OD + 1200mg A Q3W was well tolerated in GBM pts. Early efficacy signals were detected with PTEN loss being a promising predictive biomarker for response to combination.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Immuno-oncology,PTEN,Phase I,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Crescens Tiu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wing Hing Yau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Liam C.

Gremlin-1, secreted by cancer-associated fibroblasts, downregulates bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), members of the transforming growth factor &#946; superfamily, resulting in tumor stemness, hyperproliferation, and invasiveness. Ginisortamab, a fully human IgG4P mAb, neutralizes gremlin-1, thus restoring BMP signaling. Preclinical studies showed that ginisortamab binds to gremlin-1 and has antitumor activity in several mouse models, including GI cancers. Here we report the initial findings from Part A (monotherapy dose escalation) of the first-in-human study. ONC001 (NCT04393298) is an ongoing multi-part, multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, Phase I\/II study assessing the safety, PK\/PD, and antitumor activity of intravenous (IV) ginisortamab as monotherapy or in combination with selected standard of care regimens in patients (pts) with advanced solid tumors. ONC001 includes 3 dose escalation modules (Parts A-C) and a dose adaptation module (Part A1). To be eligible for Part A, pts had to be aged &#8805;18 years (y) with advanced disease, resistant or refractory to standard therapy, with ECOG PS &#8804;1. We present the primary (safety, tolerability), secondary (PK\/PD), and exploratory (antitumor activity) endpoints, as well as the monotherapy RP2D from Part A. At data cutoff (June 20, 2022), 25 pts received &#8805;1 dose of ginisortamab (median [range] age: 64 [37-74] y; 68% male; 88% White; 36% had &#62;3 lines of prior therapy). The most common tumor type enrolled was colorectal adenocarcinoma (44%). Ginisortamab was escalated using a modified rolling 6 design through 5 levels (100, 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 mg IV Q2W) in 28-day cycles. No DLTs, Grade &#8805;3 AEs related to ginisortamab, or serious related AEs were observed; the 2000 mg dose was deemed safe for further development. Temporary treatment interruption and study discontinuation due to AEs unrelated to ginisortamab occurred in 7 (28%) and 2 pts (8%), respectively. Ginisortamab PK aligned with expectations from preclinical models for an IgG4 mAb, allowing favorable dosing intervals. Confirmation of target occupancy was demonstrated by increases in total circulating gremlin-1. Antidrug antibody formation was not observed. The best overall response of stable disease was observed in 7\/24 pts (29%); 4 pts had a reduction of the sum of the dimensions of their target lesions relative to baseline. Favorable safety and PK\/PD data at the maximum dose of 2000 mg and preliminary antitumor activity were observed with the first-in-class anti-gremlin antibody ginisortamab. These data support further evaluation of the efficacy and safety of ginisortamab monotherapy at 2000 mg Q2W, or in combination with standard of care regimens (FOLFOX, trifluridine\/tipiracil) in advanced solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Gremlin,Ginisortamab,First-in-human clinical trial,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Debashis Sarker<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Blagden<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natalie Cook<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas R.

Occurrence of intratumoral senescence harbors broad therapeutic implications and may limit the prognosis of cancer patients, as senescent cells, via their senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP), can suppress anti-tumor immune responses and may increase the metastatic potential of non-senescent cancer cells. Preclinical data suggest that an eradication of senescent cells (senolytic therapies) or an application of SASP modulating therapies might improve the outcome of systemic cancer therapies, however, as a prerequisite to guide such approaches, robust and non-invasive modalities to visualize and quantify intratumoral senescence are needed. We recently reported on the safety evaluation of the novel Positron-Emission-Tomography (PET) tracer [<sup>18<\/sup>F]FPyGal, a radiolabeled substrate of senescence-associated &#42933;-galactosidase in healthy volunteers (AACR 2022, #7958). In summary, our data showed that the use of [<sup>18<\/sup>F]FPyGal is safe and well-tolerated in the described human study population. In the second stage of our trial, we are now investigating the concordance of histopathological senescence markers with [<sup>18<\/sup>F]FPyGal senescence signals in i) rectum cancer-, ii) non-small cell lung cancer- and iii) adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEG) patients, who are undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. Here, we report on patients from the rectum cancer cohort of the trial. [<sup>18<\/sup>F]FPyGal PET imaging was done before and after administration of neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (RCTx). [<sup>18<\/sup>F]FPyGal PET signal was correlated with immunohistochemical senescence markers (p16, p21, p53) and quantification of SA-&#223;-gal (Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase) positive cells in biopsy materials (pre-therapy) and surgical resection materials (post-therapy). Expectedly, senescent cells were only detected at very low frequency in therapy na&#239;ve tumors and the lack of histological detection of senescence correlated with negativity in [<sup>18<\/sup>F]FPyGal imaging. In stark contrast, homogenous senescence, quantified with the indicated senescence markers, was detected in the majority of cancer cells after RCTx. Interestingly, in one rectum carcinoma, which underwent a full remission after RCTx, senescence of stroma cells in the area of the former tumor bed was detected by PET imaging and histologically. Collectively, our data indicate the utility of [18F]FPyGal PET imaging to non-invasively detect senescence.

The orally available TLR7 agonist prodrug RO7119929 is converted to active drug predominantly in the liver. It was hypothesized to effectively reprogram the local immune microenvironment and thus enhance anti-tumor activity in liver tumors.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> In this phase 1, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation study (NCT04338685), eligible pts had histologically confirmed advanced or metastatic primary liver cancers or solid tumors with predominant liver involvement. Pts received oral RO7119929 weekly in 3-week cycles in Part A (dose-escalation: Flat dosing [FD][A1], step-up dosing [SUD][A2] or FD with tocilizumab pre-treatment [A3]) and Part B (FD dose expansion with paired biopsies). Participants received treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal. Primary endpoints were maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and\/or optimal biologic dose and safety.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> At data cut-off (22 April 2022), 55 pts were enrolled (A1: n=27; A2: n=9; A3: n=1; B1: n=18). Median age: 58 years; 76% male; 51% Asian; 52% received &#8805;3 prior lines of therapy; 31% HCC as primary tumor type. Most pts discontinued treatment due to disease progression (75%). Among 17 HCC pts, a durable complete response was observed in one pt and 10 (59%) pts had stable disease. Treatment-related AEs were reported in 91% of pts, most common event was CRS (87%). Fever following drug administration was generally reported as CRS, and most CRS events were Grade 1 (fever). With FD, Grade 2 CRS occurred in 20 (44%) pts and Grade 3 CRS in 6 (13%) pts. With SUD, Grade 2 CRS occurred in one (11%) pt and no Grade 3 CRS was reported. The incidence and severity of CRS events was dose&#8209;dependent. Events generally had a predictable onset within 12h post-dosing. All events resolved, the majority within 1-2 days. CRS events of Grade 2\/3 commonly occurred in Cycle 1, with later events rarely exceeding Grade 1. Increases in the TLR7-related peripheral pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers IFN&#945;, ISG15 and IL6 were associated with higher doses, with particularly IL6 correlating with CRS severity. With SUD, high levels of IFN&#945; and ISG15 levels were maintained while IL6 levels were reduced compared with FD. Pharmacokinetics (PK) of the active TLR7 agonist drug appeared linear (Cmax, AUC) and time-independent with a short effective t<sub>1\/2<\/sub> of approximately 5h on average. PK, PD and safety modeling-informed dose decisions.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b> CRS was identified as a dose-limiting safety risk, the incidence and severity of CRS appeared dose-dependent, and events were predictable and manageable. SUD reduced the risk of CRS whilst maintaining mode of action relevant PD effects. Combination therapy with a checkpoint inhibitor may be needed to leverage the pro-inflammatory potential of RO7119929 and further increase anti-tumor activity.<b><\/b><b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Liver cancer,TLR7,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Changhoon Yoo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Helena Verdaguer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chia-Chi Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Camilla Qvortrup<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Yau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Do-Youn Oh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Felix Lichtenegger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Izolda Franjkovic<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole Kratochwil<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juliana Bessa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva Rossmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elia Hall<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Congqi Dai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Oliver Krieter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Audrey Yeo Te-Ying<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Cannarile<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christina Schiff<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bruno Sangro<\/i><\/presenter>.

GPC3 is a surface antigen overexpressed in hepatocellular cancer (HCC) and virtually absent on healthy tissues. In this first-in-human (FIH) study, we investigated the feasibility, safety and initial anti- HCC efficacy of C-CAR031. C-CAR031 is an autologous, GPC3-directed armored CAR-T with affinity-tuned scFv to enhance the safety profile, and a 4-1BB and CD3&#950; signaling domain. The C-CAR031 transgene includes a T2A viral self-cleaving peptide and a dominant negative TGF-&#946; receptor II (TGF&#946;RIIDN). The expression of TGF&#946;RIIDN protects the cells against the immunosuppressive HCC TME and the T2A peptide allows for equimolar expression of the two transgene products.<br \/>Methods: This FIH, open-label dose escalation trial employs an accelerated titration plus i3+3 design. Histologically confirmed GPC3+ advanced HCC patients (pts) who failed systemic treatments received a single-dose i.v. infusion of C-CAR031 following standard lymphodepletion. The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability. Adverse events (AEs) were graded using CTCAE 5.0, and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) \/ immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) were graded according to ASTCT 2019 criteria.<br \/>Results: As of Dec. 31<sup>st<\/sup> 2022, 7 pts received two dose levels (DL1, n=1; DL2, n=6) of C-CAR031. The median number of prior lines of therapies was 4 (range 1-6). The median follow-up was 77 (40-213) days. Six pts with &#8805;28 days&#8217; follow-up were eligible for safety evaluation. The only &#8805;Gr3 non-hematologic product-related AE observed was transient Gr3 AST elevation in two pts. Five of 6 pts experienced Gr1\/2 CRS, with median time to onset and duration of 3 (range 2-7) and 4 (4-6) days. No DLT or ICANS was observed. Of the 5 pts evaluable for preliminary efficacy, 4 pts had unconfirmed PR, which are currently pending confirmation. AFP was also stabilized or reduced in all 4 patients with uPR. All 5 pts had reduction in tumor burden, with a median change of -31.2% (range -3.4- -60.6%) \/ -41.4% (-3.4- -56.6%) per RECIST1.1 \/ mRECIST. C-CAR031showed a robust cellular kinetic profile. In DL2, the median Tmax, Cmax and AUC0-28Day were 15 days, 772,014 copies\/&#956;g gDNA and 7,747,054 days*copies\/&#956;g gDNA, respectively. CAR-T cells were detectable in blood of all pts in the last follow-up.<br \/>Conclusions: In this FIH study, C-CAR031 is well tolerated and shows promising anti- tumor activity.

LY3410738 is a potent, selective, covalent, dual inhibitor of IDH1\/2 mutations (IDH1\/2m). LY3410738 binds covalently at a novel binding site, enabling continued potency in preclinical models in the setting of second site IDH resistance mutations. We present initial results from the first-in-human phase 1 study of oral LY3410738 in patients (pts) with IDH1\/2m CCA, and IDH1m glioma or other solid tumors.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Dose escalation (3+3 design) evaluated LY3410738 monotherapy in advanced IDHm CCA and other solid tumors (NCT04521686). Key objectives included determining the RP2D, safety, PK, PD (inhibition of plasma D-2-HG), and preliminary antitumor activity.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>As of 28 July 2022, 80 pts including 42 with CCA (33 IDH1m, 9 IDH2m), 27 with glioma (IDH1m), and 11 other tumor types (IDH1m) received LY3410738 dosed at 25-600 mg QD or 300 mg BID. Pts were median 52 years of age (range, 23-80) with a median of 2 prior therapies (range, 1-7). 19% of CCA pts had received prior IDH1 inhibitor. Median time on treatment was 3.7 months (range, 0.1-19). No DLTs or treatment related deaths were observed; the MTD was not reached. Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) &#8805;15% included nausea (35%), vomiting (21%), and decreased appetite (19%) and were mostly grade 1-2. Most frequent grade &#8805;3 TEAEs &#62;2% were anemia (4%), cholangitis (3%), headache (3%), decreased lymphocyte count (3%), and hyponatremia (3%). LY3410738 exposure was dose proportional. In pts with IDH1m cancers, LY3410738 achieved sustained D-2-HG inhibition at all dose levels, including in pts who received prior IDH1 inhibitor. In pts with IDH2m cancers, a higher dose (&#8805;150 mg daily dose) was required for D-2-HG inhibition. Among the 42 pts with R\/R CCA, the best response included 1 PR and 22 SD.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) based therapy is a promising immunotherapeutic strategy. In preclinical models, we established ALF501, a novel CAR-NK cells with both a high affinity for PSMA and a clinically significant tumoricidal effect on CRPC. Here we report the results from the first-in-human case of ALF501 for CRPC.<br \/>Methods: In this study, ALF501was dosed intravenous for a total of three courses, with an interval of 3 months, each infusion of 5&#215;10<sup>8<\/sup><sup> <\/sup>cells, and 3 consecutive days of infusion as a course of treatment. Observation continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity for up to 1 years. Primary objectives were safety and tolerability; secondary objectives included preliminary antitumor activity.<br \/>Results: An 80-year-old man who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in February 2018 and developed a relapse in April 2021. Starting with July 16 2021, he received three courses of ALF501. No liver and kidney toxicity was observed, and the safety profile was good. Progression-free survival was 12months as of April 23, 2022, during which PSA decreased by 97.5% from baseline. Imaging follow-up showed that the tumor was stable, and chest CT showed that the original pleural effusion and pericardial effusion disappeared, and the high-density shadow previously considered osteogenic bone metastasis was reduced overall.<br \/>Conclusions: ALF501 is safe and feasible for the treatment of CRPC, and has preliminary anti-tumor efficacy. This is a case study, and it is necessary to expand the patient sample size in the future to confirm whether there is a difference in efficacy for different patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PSMA,Natural killer cells,Prostate cancer,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Hui Shi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanan Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jie Ran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yan Jin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shengbang Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qi Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huiyuan Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Lida Wu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuchun Gu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shengjiang Tan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yao Wang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Although several strategies show successful results, it remains to prevent the subsequent cancer escape from the immune surveillance. The further success depends on a variety of functional effector cell types involved and their sustenance following activation. For this purpose, simultaneous induction of innate and adaptive immunity should be one of ideal strategies. We focus on DCs, which play a pivotal role in determining the quality and magnitude of innate and adaptive immunity. To effectively utilize the DC <i>in situ<\/i>, we have developed a system using allogeneic cells as artificial adjuvant vector cells (aAVCs), comprised of a CD1d-NKT ligand complex on the cell surface and containing tumor antigen inside of the cells. This approach induces adjuvant effects by combining NKT cell activation with delivery of tumor antigen to DCs<i> in vivo<\/i>. In addition to linking innate and adaptive immunity, aAVC therapy can lead to efficient trafficking of specific anti-tumor CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells to the tumor site and also the formation of long-term memory T cells. This novel design of aAVC therapy is a platform and allows for a replacement of any cancer antigens as the therapeutic package. After completion of the regulatory science consultation for discussing the pharmaceutical quality and the design of a clinical study with PMDA in Japan, we developed the WT1-expressing aAVC (aAVC-WT1) for the clinical application.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>This first-in-human, open label, single-center trial involves a bifurcated 3+3 design with aAVC-WT1 dose escalations (1 &#215; 10<sup>6<\/sup>, 1 &#215; 10<sup>7<\/sup>, and 1 &#215; 10<sup>8 <\/sup>per body). The three patients in each cohort had not received any chemotherapy during more than 2 weeks before the therapy and had received aAVC-WT1 intravenously twice in a 4-week interval. Nine of the ten enrolled patients with relapsed and refractory AML underwent complete analysis per-protocol set and were evaluated<i> <\/i>in our phase I dose-escalation trial of aAVC-WT1.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> No dose-limiting toxicities were observed, whereas activation of NKT and\/or NK cells was observed in all patients. Five patients experienced objective leukemic regression, which correlated with WT1-specific T-cell responses. Paired single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing demonstrated effector CD8<sup><sup>+<\/sup> <\/sup>T cell clones in the bone marrow. Some bone marrow CD8<sup><sup>+<\/sup> <\/sup>T cells underwent transition from pre-existing precursor exhausted T cells to functional T cells or emerged as newly activated T cells, some of which were maintained long-term. These demonstrate the feasibility and safety of aAVC-WT1 therapy and the capacity of this platform to activate both innate and adaptive immunity in humans.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: aAVC-WT1 therapy showed an acceptable safety profile at doses tested and encouraging signs of clinical response. These data support further development of aAVC-WT1 for patients with AML.

The effectiveness of stem cell transplant and associated graft vs. leukemia effect implies an important role for immune-based therapy in producing long lasting remissions. Traditional approaches using immunotherapy have failed to establish a suitable surface target or treatment paradigm that is effective in myeloid malignancies. Hu8F4 is a humanized T-cell receptor-like monoclonal antibody that binds to the conformational epitope of PR1 bound to HLA-A2, which is highly, differentially expressed on the surface of AML compared to normal progenitors.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We conducted a first in human, phase I dose escalation trial of Hu8F4 in pts with myeloid malignances. Pts with R\/R AML, MDS, CMML, and myeloid blast phase of CML with adequate organ function and PS &#8804; 2 were eligible. Pts were treated on 7 escalating dose levels, ranging from 0.01 mg\/kg to 10 mg\/kg IV on D1 &#38; 15. Initial dose levels required 1 pt per dose (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1), followed by 3 pts per dose (3, 10).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>10 pts with R\/R AML have been enrolled, with a median age of 65 years (range, 23-77), including 6 females (60%). Pts had received a median of 4 (1-4) prior therapies; 5 pts (50%) had a PS of 2. At enrollment, the median WBC was 1.9 (0.1 - 18.4), median BM blasts were 32% (8 - 76); 9 (90%) pts had complex karyotype and 3 (30%) had a <i>TP53<\/i> mutation. All pts had &#62; 98% surface expression of PR1 on the myeloid blasts. Hu8F4 Cmax ranged up to 160,000 ng\/mL with t1\/2 of 48 hours and clearance of 2.61 hr*ng\/mL at the highest dose. Weak anti-drug antibodies were observed after week 4 in 2 of 3 pts treated at 3 mg\/kg. With a median follow up of 3.5 months (1.1 - 9.9), pts have received a median of 1 (1-4) cycle of therapy. Two pts had decline in BM blasts and 4 had stable disease. Routine peripheral blood testing revealed sharp decline in peripheral blasts immediately after infusion of Hu8F4 on D1 and 15 with associated elevation in serum LDH in some pts and a rise in normal granulocytes, consistent with on-tumor effects. The pharmacokinetic parameters and transient blast reduction indicated a possible sink effect mediated by high levels of circulating blasts. SAEs documented on study were mostly disease-related and included infections, cytopenias, hemoptysis, pneumonia, and GI bleeding. Treatment related AEs were temporally related to the infusion included hypotension (Grade 2: N=2), rigors (Grade 2: N=2; Grade 1: N=1). All infusion reactions were observed at dose levels of 3 and 10 mg\/kg, but were transient, and managed with steroids and antihistamines. All pts proceeded with their next dose without further issues. No cytokine release syndrome or neurologic toxicity was observed. Correlative studies support antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis as important mechanisms of anit-AML activity.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b>Hu8F4 was well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities observed at the maximum planned dose. On-target peripheral blast reduction temporally related to infusion suggests biological activity. Real-time pharmacokinetic data on study indicate a possible sink effect that may be overcome by a more frequent dosing strategy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Acute myeloid leukemia,Monoclonal antibodies,T-cell Receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tapan M.

The molecule also potently targets classical EGFR mutations ExDel19, L858R and T790M with a high degree of selectivity over wild-type EGFR.<br \/>Methods: The study is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation and expansion study conducted entirely in China, to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor effect of PLB1004, administered orally once per day, in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety profile of PLB1004 and determine the RP2D of the molecule.<br \/>Results: Dose escalation ranged from a starting dose of 10 mg QD to a top dose of 480 mg QD in 11 cohorts of patients. Dose expansion is ongoing at two dose levels, 320 mg QD and 400 mg QD. At the cutoff date for this abstract, July 31, 2022, a total of 65 patients (32 in escalation and 33 in expansion) had received treatment with PLB1004. The median age of the patients is 58 years old (range 31 to 77). Most patients are women (60%) with adenocarcinoma (95%) and good performance status (ECOG 0-1 in 90%). Prior therapy for NSCLC included platinum-based chemotherapy in 54% of patients and TKI therapy in 58%. Of note 58% of patients had intra-cranial metastases at baseline. The most frequent treatment related adverse events included diarrhea in 75% of patients (18% Grade 3), rash in 60% of patients (11% Grade 3), mouth ulceration in 43% of patients (1.5% Grade 3), elevated serum creatinine in 43% of patients (0% Grade 3) and elevated aspartate aminotransferase in 41% of patients (3% Grade 3). The criteria for DLT were not reported at any dose level and thus an MTD was not determined during cycle 1 of drug administration. Beyond Cycle 1, at the highest dose levels, frequent dose interruptions and reductions due to toxicity were observed, and further dose escalation was not attempted above 480 mg QD. A more complete summary of safety data will be presented at the meeting. Across all dose groups, a total of 38 subjects had EGFR Ex20ins mutations, including 29 at doses &#8805; 160 mg QD, among whom 26 completed at least 1 tumor assessment. In these 26 patients the confirmed response rate was 57.7% (15\/26) and the disease control rate (DCR) was 100% (26\/26). Duration of response exceeded 6 months in 40% of responders.<br \/>Conclusion: In the ongoing Phase 1 study, PLB1004 appears to be safe and well-tolerated with promising anti-tumor activity in patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI),EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations,NSCLC,Phase I,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jinji Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yilong Wu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meijuan Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yanqiu Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianying Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ying Mao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Huimin Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yun Fan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David Chung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Kevin Schaab<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Preclinical studies show MEM-288 induces robust dendritic cell-mediated systemic T cell responses capable of inhibiting abscopal tumor growth as monotherapy and synergizes with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI).<br \/>Methods: Safety, antitumor and immunologic activity of MEM-288 are being evaluated in this Phase 1, multicenter, open-label trial (NCT05076760). Pts with select solid tumors including NSCLC (a) refractory to standard therapy and (b) with a tumor lesion deemed feasible for biopsy and MEM-288 intratumoral injection are eligible. The primary objective is to determine a recommended phase 2 dose of MEM-288 monotherapy across 3 dose levels (DL1-3) spanning 1e10 to 1e11 viral particles by intratumoral injection once every 3 weeks, for up to 6 injections, using a BOIN design. Secondary objectives include efficacy assessment (including response rate of injected and non-injected tumors assessed separately). Tumor biopsies immediately prior to the 1st and 2nd injections, and peripheral blood at serial timepoints, are used to explore biomarkers and anti-tumor immune responses.<br \/>Results: As of Jan 2023, the study is ongoing with the DL3 high-dose cohort completing accrual. 11 pts (10 NSCLC and 1 pancreatic) enrolled and received &#8805;1 dose of MEM-288 (n=3 DL1, n=5 DL2, n=3 DL3). No dose limiting toxicities have been reported to date and no pts have discontinued treatment due to toxicity. Treatment-related adverse events observed in &#62;1 pt include grade 1 injection site reaction (45%) and chills (18%). Of 7 pts evaluable for response, 3 had shrinkage of injected tumor (range -40 to -54%), and multiple pts also had stabilization or shrinkage of distal non-injected lesions with best RECIST response in uninjected tumors as 2 SD and 5 PD. After a single MEM-288 injection, biopsies show decreased tumor cell percentage concomitant with substantial increases in overall CD8+ T cells, increased T clonotype diversity in both tumor and peripheral blood, and increased TCF1+ stem-like CD8+ T cells that are strongly associated with response to ICIs. Plasma cytokine analysis showed increases in IFN&#947; and of IFN-inducible cytokines and chemokines, supportive of stimulation of systemic response after MEM-288. Of note, a pt with strong stimulation of tumor and systemic T cell immunity after MEM-288 had a subsequent CR (ongoing &#62;6 months) to docetaxel + ramucirumab following prior treatment failure with platinum doublet + ICI received before MEM-288.<br \/>Conclusions: Preliminary safety, antitumor and immune response data are encouraging. Updated results and immune data will be presented. An expansion arm is planned with combination MEM-288 and anti-PD1 antibody in pts with advanced NSCLC refractory to ICI.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic virus,CD40,Interferons,NSCLC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andreas N.

This first-in-human clinical trial studied the safety and biodistribution of two novel MC1R-targeted imaging tracers designed to support the development of MC1R-targeted alpha particle therapy through image-based identification of MC1R and radiation dosimetry. Imaging was compared to MC1R expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) of subjects&#8217; melanoma tumors.<br \/>Methods: Subjects with stage IV melanoma were randomized to receive either [<sup>203<\/sup>Pb]VMT01 SPECT\/CT imaging followed by [<sup>68<\/sup>Ga]VMT02 PET\/CT imaging approximately 1 month later, or vice versa in a cross-over design during their normal melanoma treatment course. Patient selection included a positive [<sup>18<\/sup>F]FDG PET\/CT within 30 days of imaging tracer injection. 555 - 925 mBq of [<sup>203<\/sup>Pb]VMT01 was injected IV with imaging performed at 1, 4, and 24 hours. 74 - 277 mBq [<sup>68<\/sup>Ga]VMT02 was injected IV and imaging performed dynamically up to 1 hour, and at 2 and 3 hours. Due to an interruption in drug supply, only 3 subjects received [<sup>203<\/sup>Pb]VMT01 imaging. Key FDG-avid melanoma lesions were marked and presented to three experienced Radiologists serving as blinded reviewers. The blinded reviewers compared [<sup>18<\/sup>F]FDG PET\/CT to experimental imaging and scored scans and key lesions on multiple metrics. Imaging positivity was defined as tumor uptake and retention of tracer in &#8805; 1 melanoma tumors above background liver activity. Melanoma biopsy tissue was obtained and MC1R IHC performed as available.<br \/>Results: 7 subjects were enrolled; 6 were imaged and 5 had available pathology. 3 of 6 imaged subjects had MC1R positive tumors <i>via<\/i> experimental imaging tracers. [<sup>68<\/sup>Ga]VMT02 PET\/CT at 3 hours led to the best tumor to background ratio, and [<sup>203<\/sup>Pb]VMT01 SPECT\/CT showed tumor retention at 24 hours. 4 of 5 subjects had positive MC1R staining by IHC. Of the 3 subjects with negative imaging, 2 had positive staining by IHC. Of the 3 subjects with positive imaging, 2 had available biopsies and all stained positive for MC1R by IHC.<br \/>Conclusion: A subgroup of advanced melanoma patients were identified to express MC1R using new MC1R-targeted imaging agents. Full concordance between imaging and IHC of positive scans, but not with negative scans, suggests that IHC is a more sensitive biomarker detection method. Additional testing is needed to establish frequency of positive MC1R imaging in stage IV melanoma and its correlation to histological findings and treatment outcomes. Preferential tumor retention provides proof-of-concept that the MC1R-targeting therapy trial for [<sup>212<\/sup>Pb]VMT01 alpha-emitting therapy will deliver localized radiation to high MC1R expressing tumors as screened by [<sup>203<\/sup>Pb]VMT01 or [<sup>68<\/sup>Ga]VMT02. Imaging quality is sufficient for subject selection and dosimetry but may exclude subjects with MC1R receptor expression only detectable by IHC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Radiation therapy,Targeted alpha therapy,Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brenna M.

HH2853 was administered orally twice daily (BID) on a continuous 28-day treatment cycle. Ph I consist of two parts: dose escalation part adopting accelerated titration followed by a Bayesian optimal interval design and dose extension part. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was evaluated during the 1<sup>st<\/sup> cycle in dose escalation.

Immunotherapy (IO) augments anticancer activity with intratumoral agents in prior preclinical and clinical studies. This phase 1b dose escalation study assessed safety and potential synergistic effects of pembrolizumab and C. novyi-NT in advanced solid tumors. METHODS: We enrolled patients with percutaneous injectable, solid tumors to receive single intratumoral injection of C. novyi-NT administered on Day 8 across 4 dose cohorts (3x10^4 to 100 x10^4 spores, 3+3 design) with pembrolizumab 200mg IV Q3weekly starting on Day 0 up to 24 months. Primary objectives: Safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of combination. Secondary objectives: anti-tumor activity of combination in the injected tumor lesion and overall response by iRECIST 1.1. RESULTS: At data cutoff on October 24, 2022, 16 patients were enrolled and evaluable for toxicity and efficacy. It was well tolerated across all cohorts without dose limiting toxicities with median number of 5 cycles administered (1-34). 10 patients (63%) experienced progression; 1 withdrew consent; 1 completed therapy; 1 came off trial due to toxicity (immune related dermatitis) and 3 patients remain on trial. Median age was 62.5 years (40-71) while all patients (100%) had performance status of 1. 8 (50%) received prior IO and 7 (44%) had &#62; 4 lines of prior therapies. Confirmed overall objective response rate (ORR) was 25% in 4 patients [non-keratinizing undifferentiated nasopharyngeal squamous carcinoma (NPC), human papilloma virus positive squamous cell carcinoma of base of tongue, vulvar melanoma and chordoma] with 3 partial responses (PR) and 1 complete response (CR). Among responders, median duration of response was 8.18 months and 1\/4 (25%) had prior IO. NPC patient completed 24 months on trial to completion with best response at PR (-87%) while vulvar melanoma patient remains on trial with best response at CR (-100%). Median injected tumor size was 2.65cm (1-11) with confirmed ORR in injected lesions at 19% with 2 PRs and 1 CR. Most prevalent grade 1 and 2 adverse events were injection site reaction (25%), pyrexia (19%), pruritus (13%), leukopenia (13%) and anemia (13%). No grade 3 or 4 treatment related adverse events noted. Signs and symptoms of C. novyi-NT germination (infection) including fever, injection site pain, erythema, swelling, tenderness, and in some cases, ulceration, spontaneous drainage, tissue sloughing, bleeding, and malodor were observed in 5 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Intratumoral C. novyi-NT with pembrolizumab demonstrates clinical activity with favorable tolerability in patients regardless of tumor histology.

This first-in-patient, phase 1b, study assessed the use of ponsegromab, a monoclonal antibody against GDF-15, in participants with advanced cancer and cachexia.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Methods: <\/b>Adult participants (n = 10) with cachexia, advanced cancer (non-small cell lung, colorectal, or pancreatic), and elevated serum concentrations of GDF-15 received open-label subcutaneous ponsegromab every three weeks (Q3W) for 12 weeks in addition to standard of care anti-cancer treatment. Study endpoints included assessment of ponsegromab safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics. Serum GDF-15 concentrations and exploratory measures of efficacy were also assessed.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>No treatment-related adverse events or injection site reactions were reported. No adverse trends in clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, or electrocardiogram parameters attributable to ponsegromab dosing were evident. Ninety-two adverse events deemed unrelated to treatment were reported; most were mild (Grade 1 = 58.7%) or moderate (Grade 2 = 28.3%) in severity. All participants were negative for anti-drug antibodies at baseline (n = 10) and after receiving 5 doses (Q3W) of ponsegromab (n = 9). Mean unbound ponsegromab C<sub>trough<\/sub> ranged from 4.041-4383 ng\/mL between Days 22-106. An elevated GDF-15 concentration was required for inclusion in the study. Following initiation of study treatment, median unbound GDF-15 concentration was reduced to below the lower limit of quantification (0.0424 ng\/mL) on day 1 and remained suppressed until week 15 (3 weeks after final dose). Increases in body weight were observed at all time points during the treatment (weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12) and follow-up (weeks 15, 18, and 24) periods. The mean (SD) body weight at baseline was 70.49 (16.97) kg. An LS mean (SE) increase of 4.63 kg (1.98) was observed at week 12 (end of treatment); representing an increase of approximately 6.5% relative to baseline. Improvements in actigraphy-based assessments of physical activity and in quality of life, including appetite, as assessed by Functional Assessment of Anorexia-Cachexia Therapy (FAACT) total and subscale scores, were also observed during the course of ponsegromab treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: In participants with advanced cancer, cachexia, and elevated baseline GDF-15, ponsegromab was well tolerated and suppressed serum GDF-15 concentrations to below the median concentration seen in healthy subjects. Preliminary evidence of efficacy, including a mean observed weight gain of approximately 6.5% at 12 weeks, supports continued development of ponsegromab for the treatment of cancer cachexia.

RBN-2397 is a first-in-class PARP7 inhibitor that induces IFN and an adaptive immune response. The tumor-intrinsic immunomodulatory mechanism of RBN-2397 and preliminary antitumor activity in patients (pts) was demonstrated during dose escalation (Falchook, ASCO 2021; Kuplast-Barr, AACR 2022).<br \/><b><\/b><br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Pts with solid tumors were treated with RBN-2397 at the RP2D of 200 mg BID in 3 expansion cohorts: squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (SCCL), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (HR+ BC). Objectives of the expansion phase included safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity.<br \/><b><\/b><br \/><b>Results:<\/b> As of 2 July 2022, 31 pts have been treated: SCCL (n=13), HNSCC (n=10), and HR+ BC (n=8). RBN-2397-related AEs (all grades &#62;10%) included dysgeusia (42%, n=13), nausea (26%, n=8), fatigue (23%, n=7), with Grade 3 events of nausea and pleural infection (each n=1) and ALT\/AST increase (n=2), and no Grade 4 events. No significant chronic toxicities were observed. The disease control rate in response-evaluable pts was 44% in SCCL (stable disease [SD] in 4\/9 pts), 71% in HNSCC (RECIST partial response [PR] for 12+ months in 1\/7; SD in 4\/7), and 29% in HR+ BC (SD in 2\/7). Biomarker analyses confirmed <i>PARP7 <\/i>mRNA expression in all baseline biopsies, with H-scores higher in tumor cells than in stromal cells (n=26, H-score range 66-256, P&#60;0.0001). Four of 17 evaluable pts showed <i>PARP7 <\/i>focal copy number gains, and 2 had copy number gains that tracked with chromosome 3 copy number. One pt with HPV-negative HNSCC (nonsmoker; paranasal sinus primary) has an ongoing durable RECIST PR (&#8722;41%) for 12+ months. Tumor analysis of this responder confirmed <i>PARP7 <\/i>expression at baseline and <i>SMARCB1<\/i> deletion, and demonstrated an excluded immune phenotype by IHC and MIBI-SCOPE. Analyses of paired tumor biopsies confirmed induction of adaptive immunity with &#8805;2-fold increases in CD8+ T cells and\/or granzyme B expression in 10 (63%) of 16 pts across tumor types. Increases in immune checkpoint expression (PD-1 and LAG3 on T cells; PD-L1 on tumor cells) from 30% to 150% were observed in 3 (60%) of 5 pt tumor samples evaluated using MIBI-SCOPE, indicating the potential to prime tumors for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. These changes were independent of PARP7 copy number or <i>PARP7<\/i> mRNA expression level at baseline.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> RBN-2397 was well tolerated at biologically active drug exposures, with preliminary antitumor activity observed. Paired tumor biopsy translational studies demonstrated the immunomodulatory mechanism of RBN-2397 and support the ongoing trial of RBN-2397 in combination with pembrolizumab (NCT05127590).<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Small molecule drugs,Squamous cell carcinoma,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Timothy A.

Q3W as monotherapy (S1: NCT04158583) or in combination with atezolizumab 1200 mg Q3W (S2: NCT04642365) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and\/or optimal biological dose, safety and preliminary clinical activity. DLT window was 4 weeks and dose increments were determined by a Bayesian-based continuous reassessment method (CRM) with overdose control. Adverse events (AEs) were graded by NCI CTCAE v5.0. Tumors were assessed by RECIST 1.1 every 8 weeks in the first year and then every 12 weeks.<br \/>Results<br \/>As of 27th May, 2022, 76 patients have been treated with RG6292 monotherapy (dose ranging from 0.3 - 165 mg). Six DLTs were reported, including rash, papular rash, rash macular-papular, AST elevation and ALT elevation. MTD is 165 mg. Seventy-five patients (99%) experienced at least one AE. The most common AEs were pruritus (32%), rash (29%) and fatigue (29%). Thirty-five patients (46%) experienced grade &#8805; 3 AEs and 2 patients discontinued from study treatment due to AEs. Fourteen patients (18%) experienced grade &#8805; 3 TRAEs. No AEs led to a fatal outcome. Median treatment duration was 43 days. Twenty-three patients have SD as best overall response. Forty-eight patients have been treated with RG6292 (dose ranging from 0.3 - 160 mg) in combination with atezolizumab. Two DLTs were reported, including immune system disorder and maculopapular rash. MTD has not been reached. Forty-seven patients (98%) experienced at least one AE. The most common AEs reported were pruritus (44%), rash (33%) and fatigue (33%). Twenty patients (42%) experienced grade &#8805;3 AEs and 2 patients discontinued from study treatment due to AEs. Five patients (10%) experienced grade &#8805;3 TRAEs. No AEs led to a fatal outcome. Median treatment duration was 54 days. Pruritus and rash were expected AEs and easily managed withtopical steroids or short course, low dose systemic steroids. Two patients have PR and 19 patients have SD as best overall response.<br \/>Conclusion<br \/>RG6292 is well tolerated and has a manageable safety profile as a single agent and in combination with atezolizumab. The preliminary safety and clinical activity from dose-escalation warrant further investigation of RG6292.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Regulatory T cells,Phase I,Safety,Efficacy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Valentina Gambardella<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Ong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Esperanza Rodriguez Ruiz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean-Pascal Machiels<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Miguel Fernandez de Sanmamed<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josep Maria Tabernero<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Spreafico<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel J Renouf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen J Luen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachel Galot<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bernard Doger de Speville Uribe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emiliano Calvo Aller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aung Naing<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samira Curdt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva Rossmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tamara Tanos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin Smart<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Amann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuying Xie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabriel Schnetzler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christophe Boetsch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vaios Karanikas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Theresa Kolben<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linxinyu Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristoffer S Rohrberg<\/i><\/presenter>.
