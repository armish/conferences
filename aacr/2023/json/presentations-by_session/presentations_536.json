However, development of resistance to VEN and its combinations is common, which poses a significant clinical challenge to the management of AML. Heterogeneity in resistance can exist not only across different tumors but also within the same tumor. While some mechanisms of resistance have been revealed, others remain elusive. Here, we derive a VEN resistance signature from AML cell-lines in CCLE, and utilize non-negative matrix factorization to decompose the signature and systematically define four transcriptionally distinct clusters of VEN resistant AML patient using the BeatAML cohort, consisting of 186 patients. By integrating gene expression and drug response profiles from these patients, we elucidate distinct expression programs underlying VEN resistance in these clusters and their associated vulnerabilities. Samples in Cluster 1 are characterized by high frequency of <i>DNMT3A<\/i> and RAS (<i>KRAS<\/i> and <i>NRAS<\/i>) mutations, strong monocytic phenotype and high PI3K-mTOR signaling, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and fatty acid metabolism, indicating improved metabolic fitness. These samples also show remarkable sensitivity to panobinostat, an HDAC inhibitor, which suppresses mTORC1 signaling and OXPHOS. Cluster 3, in contrast, is characterized by <i>TP53<\/i> and <i>SRSF2<\/i> mutations, high CTL infiltration and activation of JAK-STAT and MAPK signaling, which regulate pro-survival pathways and proliferation. They also show selective sensitivity to JAK family inhibitors. Cluster 3-like AML cell-lines also show remarkable sensitivity to the JAK inhibitor, ruxolitinib. Cluster 2 samples exhibit high rates of NRAS mutations and suppression of <i>HOX <\/i>genes. Finally, Cluster 4 samples are transcriptionally similar to VEN sensitive patients, but show higher interferon signaling and higher rates of DNMT3A and IDH1 mutations. We validated these clusters using the TCGA AML (n=173) and a second BeatAML cohort (n=182).We further confirmed the existence and therapeutic value of these clusters by projecting them onto single-cell RNA-seq data obtained from a patient before and after VEN+azacitidine treatment. In pre-treatment cells, both VEN sensitive (41%) and resistance (59%) signatures were present in the patient tumor, however, post-treatment we observed that Cluster 1 (5%) and Cluster 2 (93%) like resistant cells accounted for most of the tumor cells. While Cluster 1 like cells were characterized by activation of metabolic pathways, the more proliferative Cluster 2 like cells dominated the tumor after relapse. Our study systematically identified and characterized mechanistic heterogeneity in venetoclax resistant AMLs and can aid therapeutic decision making and development of effective combination therapies with venetoclax.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Acute myeloid leukemia,Heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Vakul Mohanty<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Natalia Baran<sup>2<\/sup>, Yuefan Huang<sup>1<\/sup>, Shan He<sup>1<\/sup>, Ramiz Iqbal<sup>1<\/sup>, CTD2 consortium<sup><\/sup>, Jeffrey Tyner<sup>3<\/sup>, Gordon Mills<sup>4<\/sup>, Marina Konopleva<sup>5<\/sup>, Ken Chen<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>Leukemia, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>3<\/sup>Cell, Development and Cancer Biology, OHSU Knight Cancer Insitute, Portland, OR,<sup>4<\/sup>Cell, Developmental and Cancer Biology, OHSU Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR,<sup>5<\/sup>Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7443a37a-98ac-45fb-bf33-863ad5ec2346","ControlNumber":"6172","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>V.

Empirically developed combination therapies have had remarkable impact on cancer survival, yet the task of using preclinical data to predict combinations that will yield clinical benefits remains a challenge. Current combination strategies often prioritize drug synergy, where short-term effect of a drug combination is more than additive. However, prior studies of antibiotic resistance have shown that synergistic combinations can accelerate the emergence of resistance in bacteria. This occurs because synergistic drugs rely on one another for activity, resistance to one drug in the combination thereby depletes the efficacy of both. Consistent with experimental data on antibiotics, computational models of tumor evolution have predicted that when comparing equally active synergistic and non-synergistic combinations, synergy will accelerate the development of resistance in cancer cells.<br \/>Methods: In this study we aim to experimentally determine if synergistic drug combinations promote the development of resistance in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines, MOLM-13 and OCI-AML2. Using live-cell imaging we measured changes in growth rate over 21 days to observe the development of resistance to combination therapies ranging from additive to synergistic (Bliss score range - 1.6 to 19). We tested combinations of Venetoclax, Cytarabine, AZD5991, and AZD1775. We also measured the fitness benefit conferred from acquired resistance by comparing the difference between cellular growth rate during the first 72 hours of treatment and the maximum growth rate achieved by emerging resistant populations over the 21 day treatment.<br \/>Results: When controlling for both activity and drug synergy using logistic regression, increased drug synergy is consistently predictive of increased likelihood of resistance development within 21 days (MOLM-13 p=0.001, OCI-AML2 p=0.007, n=150 per cell line). As previously predicted, there is also significant correlation between drug synergy and the fitness benefit of resistance (MOLM-13 R=0.71, p=1.6e-6). Furthermore, using a model of competing drug-sensitive and resistant subpopulations treated with combination therapy, we demonstrate that these observations are a mechanistic consequence of synergistic combination, whereby the fitness benefit acquired by gaining resistance to either drug in a synergistic combination is greater than the fitness benefit in a non-synergistic combination.<br \/>Conclusion: Together these data have important implications for preclinical prioritization of combination therapies, and demonstrate that both short-term and long-term measures of drug efficacy can inform preclinical strategies aiming to develop novel combinations of cancer therapies with robust and durable efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Resistance,Combination therapy,Synergism,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Emily Mason-Osann<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Amy E.

Inhibition of the menin-MLL1 interaction by SNDX-5613 (revumenib) has demonstrated robust clinical responses in the current AUGMENT clinical trial (NCT04065399). During the trial, some responders relapsed during treatment due to acquired resistance in MEN1. Somatic MEN1 mutations were found at residues M327, G331 or T349 which diminished SDNX-5613 binding affinity and mediated therapeutic resistance. The presence of acquired resistance validates MEN1 as a therapeutic target in MLLr and NPM1c AML patients.<br \/>Here we characterize the effects of these mutations on the activity of 6 menin inhibitor chemotypes currently in clinical trials (NCT04065399\/Syndax, NCT04067336\/Kura, NCT04811560\/JNJ, NCT04988555\/Sumitomo, NCT04752163\/Daiichi, NCT05153330\/Biomea). In vitro activity and binding modes for these compounds were evaluated in wild-type (WT) and mutant menins using (i) competition binding assays, (ii) cell-based proliferation assays and (iii) X-ray co-crystallography.<br \/>For binding, His6-tagged MEN1 mutant proteins (G331R, M327I, M327V, T349M) were expressed and purified. Binding affinities were measured in competition binding format. The menin-MLL interaction was monitored by HTRF using Terbium labeled anti-His6 antibody and FITC labeled MLL peptide (4-43). Acquired mutations affected binding affinities (Ki) to varying degrees. Notably, M327I\/V mutations reduced binding for all menin-MLL inhibitors ranging from ~30-300, indicating a class effect for this mutation. An irreversible Biomea chemotype did not inhibit menin-MLL binding in our assays.<br \/>The decreased binding affinity to M327I was reflected in cell-based proliferation assays. Menin mutations were introduced into MV4;11 cells using CRISPR-Cas9 in conjunction with a homology directed repair template to edit the endogenous MEN1 coding sequence. Clonal lines were established harboring homozygous (homo) and heterozygous (het) M327I mutations. The M327I (het) MV4;11 cells experienced 15-50-fold shifts in IC50 vs WT cells, consistent with the reduced binding affinities.<br \/>The molecular basis for sensitivity to M327 acquired resistance was examined by X-ray co-crystallography of inhibitors bound to M327I and WT menin. Both KO-539 and SNDX-5613 show notable changes in binding in M327I vs WT menin. The isoleucine creates a steric clash, displacing their position in the pocket as previously noted. The Janssen chemotype shows a novel binding mode. Although it has 30-fold lower affinity for M327I, it shows little change in its bound position to M327I menin.<br \/>Given the clinical validation of menin inhibition in AML, the design of next generation compounds that block MLL1 binding while avoiding acquired MEN1 mutations may be a strategy to overcome acquired resistance to first generation menin inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Targeted therapy,Resistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Florian Perner<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sheng  F.

We generated Ba\/F3 models containing <i>FGFR3::TACC3<\/i> transcript with the FGFR3 kinase domain mutations detected in post-progression samples and exposed them to eight FGFR inhibitors (readouts: cell viability assays and Western blots). We established patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and cell lines to assess resistance mechanisms and perform pharmacological studies.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>Twenty-one patients with post-progression samples (n = 13 both tissue and ctDNA, n = 5 ctDNA only, n = 3 tissue only) were included in our study. The molecular driver was identified as <i>FGFR3 <\/i>mutations\/fusions in 19 cases, whereas one <i>FGFR4<\/i> mutation and one <i>FGFR2 <\/i>rearrangement were found in two patients. Patients progressed to erdafitinib (n = 14), futibatinib (n = 4) or pemigatinib (n = 3). Thirteen, six, and two patients experienced response, stable disease, and progression, respectively. At progression, we detected single mutations in the FGFR kinase domain in six (29%) patients (FGFR3 N540K, V553L, V553M, V555L, V555M, E587Q; FGFR2 L551F) and multiple mutations in one (5%) case (FGFR3<i> <\/i>N540K, V555L, L608V). Using Ba\/F3 cells, we confirmed that the detected mutations conferred resistance to FGFR inhibitors. FGFR3 V553L, emerging in a patient treated with pemigatinib, was sensitive to erdafitinib and futibatinib. We detected alterations in the mTOR pathway in 11 (52%) patients (n = 5 <i>TSC1\/2, <\/i>n = 5 <i>PIK3CA<\/i>, n = 1 <i>NF2<\/i>, n = 1 <i>PTEN<\/i>), with or without FGFR3 kinase domain mutations. In patient-derived models, erdafitinib combined with pictilisib was synergic in the presence of PIK3CA E545K, while erdafitinib-gefitinib combination overcame bypass resistance mediated by EGFR activation.<br \/><b>Conclusions <\/b>We detected a high frequency of <i>FGFR <\/i>kinase domain mutations at progression to selective FGFR inhibitors in urothelial cancer. Unlike <i>FGFR2<\/i>-driven cholangiocarcinoma, polyclonality of FGFR3 kinase domain mutations does not seem to be a hallmark of FGFR-driven urothelial cancer. The identification of off-target events and the preclinical validation sustain the potential clinical applicability of combinatorial treatment strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR),Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,erdafitinib,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Francesco Facchinetti<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Antoine Hollebecque<sup>1<\/sup>, Floriane Braye<sup>1<\/sup>, Damien Vasseur<sup>1<\/sup>, Yoann Pradat<sup>1<\/sup>, Rastislav Bahleda<sup>1<\/sup>, Cédric Pobel<sup>1<\/sup>, Ludovic Bigot<sup>1<\/sup>, Olivier Déas<sup>2<\/sup>, Juan-David Florez-Arango<sup>1<\/sup>, Giorgia Guaitoli<sup>1<\/sup>, Hayato Mizuta<sup>1<\/sup>, David Combarel<sup>1<\/sup>, Lambros Tselikas<sup>1<\/sup>, Stefan Michiels<sup>1<\/sup>, Sergey Nikolaev<sup>1<\/sup>, Jean-Yves Scoazec<sup>1<\/sup>, Santiago Ponce-Aix<sup>1<\/sup>, Benjamin Besse<sup>1<\/sup>, Ken  A.

Here, we performed a comprehensive characterization, at the single-cell level, of residual (persister) cancer cells that survive neoadjuvant treatment in HGSOC and can give rise to future recurrences. We aim to understand the adaptive responses that enable persistence and the key pathways that underlie them to find new targets for combination therapy with the ultimate goal of eradicating all tumor cells. We collected 27 tumor samples (16 pre-treatment and 11 post-neoadjuvant carboplatin\/taxol samples, with multi-site sampling per patient) for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq). To complement the patient-derived dataset and model the time course of drug persistence, we performed scRNA-Seq of 13 distinct ovarian cancer cell lines treated with chemotherapy <i>in vitro<\/i> for a series of time points up to 28 days.<br \/>We performed single-cell gene expression and copy number analyses of patient samples, annotated detailed cell types, and detected multiple immune cell populations, the majority of which maintained a highly immunosuppressive program both in untreated and treated samples. Remarkably, we detected a rare population of cancer cells that differed dramatically in their transcriptional program. These cells exhibited high expression of components of motile cilia and the transcription factor <i>FOXJ1,<\/i> a master regulator of ciliogenesis. We validated the presence of <i>FOXJ1+<\/i> cells in patient samples by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Ciliated cells were enriched in the post-treatment vs. pre-treatment samples, suggesting a possible role in drug persistence. We are now experimentally testing the role of the <i>FOXJ1<\/i>-driven transcriptional program in mediating drug resistance.<br \/>To systematically identify transcriptional programs activated in persister cells, we performed differential expression analysis on pre- vs. post-treatment samples. We identified previously implicated mechanisms of drug resistance, such as the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and the antiapoptotic response driven by <i>MCL1<\/i>. We additionally detected upregulation of the metallothionein family of genes, which may represent a mechanism of resistance to platinum-based compounds. We detected potentially novel mechanisms representing a stress response signature driven by <i>JUND<\/i>, an interferon gamma signature<i>,<\/i> and a pro-stem cell signature characterized by <i>LGR5<\/i> expression. Independently, our analysis of the ovarian cancer cell lines treated with taxol <i>in vitro <\/i>confirmed the <i>JUND<\/i> transcriptional program as potentially driving ovarian cancer persistence. Our study will help reveal pathways enabling ovarian cancer cells to persist through treatment and, ultimately, could lead to novel approaches for targeting persistence and achieving deeper therapeutic responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-03 Novel mechanisms,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Single-cell RNA Sequencing,Stress response,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Elizaveta Leshchiner<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Richard Panayiotou<sup>2<\/sup>, Anay Gupta<sup>1<\/sup>, Thomas Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Kayli Neil<sup>2<\/sup>, Nomeda Girnius<sup>2<\/sup>, Aylin Henstridge<sup>2<\/sup>, Brian  P.

However, acquired resistance to TKIs emerges over time in essentially all patients who initially respond. Recent evidence suggests that drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells, which survive and adapt to targeted therapies during an early phase of treatment, play an important role in the emergence of drug resistance. We previously reported that CD74 expression is upregulated in EGFR-mutated lung cancer after treatment with EGFR-TKIs and that CD74 can be one of the DTP cell markers. However, the mechanism underlying CD74 expression and the role of CD74 in DTP cells remain unclear. Here, we sought to identify the mechanism using cell culture systems and transgenic mouse models. We confirmed that CD74 upregulation at the mRNA level after TKIs treatments in various oncogene-mutated cell lines, including those with <i>EGFR<\/i> mutations, <i>ROS1<\/i> fusions, and <i>ALK<\/i> fusions. We found that CIITA, upstream of CD74, and TNF-&#945; expression were induced by TKIs treatments in tumor cells, leading to an increase in CD74 expression. In addition, we found that TKIs treatments enhanced the autocrine secretion of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a ligand of CD74, from tumor cells, suggesting that autocrine stimulation of the CD74 signaling results in block of apoptosis and emergence of DTP cells. To examine whether CD74 plays an important role in the emergence of resistance to TKIs <i>in vivo<\/i>, we crossed lung-specific EGFR-L858R-T790M transgenic mice with <i>Cd74<\/i> knockout mice. Complete deletion of CD74 overcame or delayed resistance to TKIs. Taken together, the MIF-CD74 axis can be a novel target to overcome resistance in driver-mutated NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Drug resistance,Targeted therapy,CD74,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Motohiro Izumi<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Meghan Lee<sup><\/sup>, Daisuke Shibahara<sup><\/sup>, Ikei S.

Despite the approval and development of KRAS G12C and KRAS G12D inhibitors respectively, mechanisms of resistance to MAPK pathway inhibitors are emerging and combination strategies are needed for patients with <i>KRAS<\/i> mt NSCLC . Avutometinib (VS-6766) is a unique RAF\/MEK clamp that inhibits MEK kinase activity and blocks RAF-mediated phosphorylation of MEK. We studied the preclinical and clinical activity of the combination of avutometinib with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in <i>KRAS<\/i> mt NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: A panel of <i>KRAS<\/i> mt NSCLC cell lines were treated for 1 hour with clinically relevant concentrations of avutometinib and everolimus and changes in phosphoproteins were measured using an antibody array. We then tested for synergy of avutometinib and everolimus in 3D proliferation assays and in the H441 NSCLC xenograft model. A clinical trial is ongoing (NCT02407509) testing the combination of 3.2 mg avutometinib with 5 mg of everolimus administered twice weekly 3 weeks on\/1 week off in 28-day cycles (previously defined as the recommended phase 2 dose) in a cohort of patients with <i>KRAS<\/i> mt NSCLC.<br \/>Results: Avutometinib inhibited the MAPK pathway (p-MEK, p-ERK, p-90RSK) with an increase in p-PRAS40, suggesting activation of the PI3K pathway as an adaptive resistance mechanism. Everolimus inhibited the PI3K pathway (p-p70S6K and p-RPS6). Among a panel of KRAS mt NSCLC cell lines, avutometinib + everolimus showed synergistic anti-proliferative activity across KRAS G12C, G12V and G12D variants (mean synergy score of ~18). In the H441 KRAS G12V NSCLC xenograft model, there was a significant reduction in tumor volume and increase in survival with the combination of avutometinib and everolimus (87% TGI; 66 days vs 36.5 days in control group) compared to control. In the clinical trial expansion, 16 patients with KRAS mt NSCLC have been treated so far with avutometinib and everolimus (5 G12V, 3 Q61H, 2 G12C, 2 G12A, 2 G12D, 1 G13A, 1 G13D; median prior lines = 2). The current objective response rate (ORR) among the 14 patients who have at least one post assessment scan is 3\/14 (21%; 1 G12V, 1 G12A, 1 G13A) with 11\/14 showing a reduction in tumor size as best response. The current progression free survival (PFS) is 5.3 months (95% CI 2.8-7.4 months) with 4 patients still on study. Updated data on the planned cohort size of 20 patients will be presented.<br \/>Conclusion: The combination of avutometinib and everolimus overcomes the activation of the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway which is an adaptive resistance mechanism to MAPK pathway inhibition. We have shown that avutometinib and everolimus induce synergistic anti-tumor effects preclinically, and preliminary data suggest clinically meaningful ORR and PFS in patients with KRAS mt NSCLC including non-G12C variants.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-05 Reversal of drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Combination therapy,MEK inhibitor,mTOR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Simon Rodney<sup>1<\/sup>, Adam  R.
