Lineage plasticity, the ability of cells to transform from one cell type to another, has been associated with intratumoral heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance. The molecular drivers and mechanisms of cancer cell plasticity and histological transdifferentiation of lung cancer are largely unknown. A deubiquitinating enzyme, Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 13 (USP13), is frequently amplified at chromosome 3q.26 amplicon in lung squamous cell carcinoma. USP13 knock-in overexpressing mouse model was crossed with <i>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D<\/sup>; Trp53<sup>fl\/fl<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>(KP) mouse to generate <i>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D<\/sup>; Trp53<sup>fl\/fl<\/sup><\/i>; <i>Usp13<sup>LSL<\/sup><\/i> (KPU) mouse model. Intratracheal administration of adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase to the lung of the KPU mouse developed aggressive lung tumors and a shortened survival compared to the KP mouse model. Importantly, while the KP mice developed lung adenocarcinoma, 100% of KPU mice developed lung squamous cell carcinoma. The squamous cell carcinoma of the KPU mice faithfully mimicked the molecular signatures, cellular pathways, and tumor microenvironments of human lung squamous cell carcinoma. Delivery of cell type-restricted viruses to the lungs further identified bronchiolar secretory club cells as the predominant cell-of-origin of KPU-induced lung squamous cell carcinoma. USP13 altered the levels of TTF-1 and c-Myc in club cells of the airway and reinforced the fate of CC10+ club cells to squamous carcinoma development instead of adenocarcinoma. USP13 directly acted on the K48-linked ubiquitination of c-Myc and increased the protein stability of c-Myc in human lung cancer cells. Overexpression of USP13 increased the half-life of c-Myc while inhibiting USP13 deubiquitinase activity decreased the c-Myc protein level. USP13 upregulated the expression of squamous lineage markers (Sox2, CK5, P40) in the primary mouse and advanced human lung cancer cells. Our findings revealed that USP13 promotes the lineage plasticity of origin-of-cells of the lung and drives transdifferentiation to squamous cell carcinoma. Finally, our study suggests the critical role of USP13 in unlocking the phenotypic plasticity of lung cancer, which may lead to novel therapeutics targeting lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ubiquitination,Myc,SOX2,Tumor heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Cecil Han<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
