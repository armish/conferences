Tumour development thus depends on bypassing restrictive signals while augmenting promoting signals. Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) are highly plastic cells and can adapt phenotypes that accelerate, brake or instruct tumour progression in a highly context-dependent manner. Here, I will describe and provide an update on a framework to understand and delineate CAF phenotypes and function in the tumour microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Claus Jorgensen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
