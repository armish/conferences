Here, we disclose for the first time the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress modulator (ERSM) M3913 that was discovered and developed following a phenotypic screening campaign. Mechanistically, M3913 engages an ER transmembrane protein not yet implicated in cancer biology to induce a Ca2+ shift from the ER towards the cytoplasm, resulting in an unfolded protein response and subsequent antitumor activity in sensitive preclinical models. We detected concurrent elevation of bona fide ER stress markers by several methods including qRT-PCR, Western Blotting analysis, and unbiased transcriptome analysis. Genetic removal of M3913&#8217;s putative ER transmembrane target abrogated the M3913-mediated, but not the Thapsigargin-mediated, ER stress response. PK\/PD studies confirmed a dose- and time-dependent upregulation of ER stress markers in preclinical cancer models <i>in vivo<\/i>. As a monotherapy, M3913 induced full and partial tumor regression in preclinical models of multiple myeloma, non-small-cell lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, and other cancers. An in vitro combination screen indicated combination potential of M3913 with standard-of-care agents and novel candidate drugs. IND-enabling toxicology and additional mechanism-of-action studies in rat and minipig uncovered specific target organs for M3913 in line with expression of the target in human tissues. This presentation details mechanistic profiling data from M3913, reveals its putative ER-resident target and discusses forward translation studies that support M3913 as a novel therapeutic option for hard-to-treat subtypes of a variety of cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Novel anticancer agents,Unfolded protein response (UPR),Drug discovery,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Frank Czauderna<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Richard Schneider<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shivapriya Ramaswamy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Susanne Brandstetter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elise Drouin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olga Bogatyrova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Johanna Mazur<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qing Sun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Catherine Jorand-Lebrun<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva Sherbetjian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jonny Nachtigall<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carolyn Wing<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christian Hildebrand<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Ellinghaus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Isabelle Lemoine<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mac Johnson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Russell Hoover<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Clark<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Ralph Lindemann<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

We hypothesized that MYC-driven cancer cell lines are addicted to protein translation, and therefore are vulnerable to the loss of the translation termination factor, GSPT1. We have discovered MRT-2359, a selective GSPT1 molecular glue degrader, that demonstrates potent and preferential antiproliferative activity in MYC-driven cell lines, such as high N- and L-MYC mRNA expressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) lines. MRT-2359 has been optimized for differential toxicity between MYC- and non-MYC-driven cancer cell lines, kinetics and depth of degradation, oral bioavailability, and in vivo efficacy. The anti-tumor activity of MRT-2359 was assessed in more than 80 lung patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) that confirmed the preferential anti-tumor activity in N- and L-MYC high NSCLC and SCLC PDXs when dosed orally daily or intermittently. Similar levels of activity were also observed in neuroendocrine lung cancer PDXs and lymphoma models.

Importantly, it is often overexpressed in several types of cancers including gastric, pancreatic, esophageal, ovarian, and lung. There are currently no approved targeted therapies for claudin 18.2-expressing cancers. As such, we designed an antibody drug conjugate, EO-3021\/SYSA1801 with the potential to selectively target and kill claudin 18.2-expressing cancer cells. EO-3021 is comprised of a novel tumor-targeting monoclonal antibody that selectively binds claudin 18.2 (Kd = 0.6 nM) that is conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). EO-3021 is internalized in claudin 18.2-expressing cells as well as demonstrates cell killing across a range of cancer cell lines with low (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 228 ng\/ml), medium (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 7 ng\/ml), and high levels of claudin 18.2 (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 28 ng\/ml) expression. More specifically, claudin 18.2-expressing cells undergo G2\/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis upon EO-3021 treatment. EO-3021 demonstrates tumor regressions with a single dose across low, medium, and high claudin 18.2-expressing in vivo models derived from pancreatic (9 mg\/kg), gastric (2 mg\/kg), and lung cancers (8 mg\/kg), respectively. In addition, a single dose of EO-3021 outperforms standard of care chemotherapies, such as cisplatin and gemcitabine, across in vivo models. Nonclinical toxicology studies suggested that EO-3021-mediated toxicities were reversible and manageable as well as afford a therapeutic index suitable for testing in humans. EO-3021\/SYSA1801 is currently being evaluated in a Phase I dose escalation study (NCT05009966) in patients with claudin 18.2 positive advanced malignant solid tumors. A case study will be presented where a confirmed and durable partial response (66.7% tumor reduction) was observed following EO-3021 treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Gastric cancer,Pancreatic cancer,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>David Dornan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

STK11-deficient syngeneic mouse tumor models reflect this biology and are insensitive to anti-PD1 treatment. Informed by <i>in vivo<\/i> CRISPR-based screens, histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) was identified as a target gene, which when knocked out in tumor cells, reverses anti-PD1 resistance driven by STK11 tumor suppressor gene loss. Here, we describe the discovery and development of TNG260 as a potent and selective inhibitor of the HDAC1-containing complex CoREST. TNG260 inhibits CoREST deacetylase activity with 500-fold selectivity over the other HDAC1-containing complexes, NuRD and Sin3, and the HDAC3-containing complex NCoR. In preclinical studies, selective CoREST inhibition by TNG260 results in transcriptional reprogramming of STK11-mutant tumor cells, altering tumor cell cytokine secretion and markedly reducing recruitment of suppressive Treg cells to STK11-mutant tumors. Moreover, TNG260, in combination with anti-PD1 treatment, drives durable tumor regressions in multiple syngeneic STK11-mutant xenograft models. TNG260 has no anti-tumor efficacy in athymic mice, indicating the responses with TNG260 are mediated by T cells. Unlike previously developed pan-HDAC inhibitors, which are directly cytotoxic to cancer (and immune) cells, IND-enabling toxicology studies in rat and dog showed that TNG260 was well-tolerated at exposures predicted to be efficacious in humans, with bone marrow suppression only detectable at doses where TNG260 is no longer selective for CoREST inhibition.
