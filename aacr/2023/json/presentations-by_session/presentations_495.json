[{"Abstract":"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia and second most common form of blood cancer in children and adolescents. Despite progress in understanding the biology of AML, therapeutic intervention plans have not changed nor outcomes significantly improved over the last years. Current AML treatment consists of intensive chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplantation. While initially many patients respond well to chemotherapy, relapse rates are high and still associated with poor prognosis. Evidence suggests that chemo-resistant leukemic stem cells (LSCs) have the ability to reinitiate and sustain the disease. Therefore, novel therapies are urgently needed to improve AML treatment and well-characterized in vivo models modelling this disease are a prerequisite for improving the current state.<br \/>At Reaction Biology, we have used NOG and NOD-SCID mice to establish a humanized MOLM-13 AML model concomitantly engrafted with human T cells. Luciferase positive MOLM-13_Luc AML cells were injected both in na&#239;ve mice and mice pre-treated with Cyclophosphamide. Thereafter, tumor growth was monitored by bioluminescence measurements to track disseminated tumor burden and isolated T cells were applied upon tumor growth detection (generally observed on day 8 or 15 post-tumor cell inoculation for NOG or NOD-SCID mice, respectively). For each of the inoculations, fresh T cells were obtained by negative selection from buffy coat derived PBMCs with a purity of &#62;95 %. Following administration of human T cells, animals were monitored daily, including the collection of animal weights (3x\/w), and tumor burden (2x\/w) via in vivo bioluminescence imaging technique.<br \/>MOLM-13_Luc tumor cells grew rapidly in all NOG mice with termination of the last animals as early as day 17. Neither Cyclophosphamide pre-treatment, nor the addition of T cells influenced tumor growth or prolonged survival. In Cyclophosphamide pre-treated NOD-SCID mice, onset of tumor growth was observed to initiate homogenously at day 13 post inoculation (with applied T cells being ineffective in reducing tumor burden), whereas tumor growth in non-pre-treated animals was heterogenous and delayed by more than 7d. The presence of T cells affected tumor growth even further. Beside T cell addition, also the application of NK cell therapies were successfully investigated (data not shown).<br \/>Taken together, the MOLM-13_Luc AML tumor model is found to be suitable for the investigation of bi-specific engagers using isolated T or NK cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-03 Human-in-mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,human immune cells,BiTE antibody,ADCC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Carla Castro<sup><\/sup>, Philipp Metzger<sup><\/sup>, Cynthia Obodozie<sup><\/sup>, <b>Holger Weber<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Reaction Biology Europe GmbH, Freiburg, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b631dc54-b209-4121-ad9f-14b7068dca07","ControlNumber":"6170","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;C.

Like the other subtypes of endometrial cancer, the incidence of CS has been increasing and it is projected to continue to rise. Additionally, there is racial disparity seen in African American women diagnosed with CS. African American women have an increased incidence of CS compared to other racial\/ethnic groups. They also have an overall increased mortality related to endometrial cancer. Compared to other histologic subtypes of endometrial cancer, CS remains rare and understudied on a molecular and cellular basis. It remains under-represented in clinical trials. Therefore, the current therapies available for CS are extrapolated from those treatments used in the other subtypes of endometrial cancer. There is a paucity of data surrounding targeted therapies for CS resulting in worse outcomes for patients who are diagnosed with this aggressive and lethal cancer. We have developed a clinically relevant, orthotopic CS murine injection model by injecting human CS patient-derived organoids (PDO) from diverse ancestries into the endometrium of immunocompromised mice. Tumor progression in the mice was monitored with physical examination, PET\/CT scan, contrast enhanced CT scan, and ultrasound. The tumor was established after three months and was visualized using various imaging techniques. The mice were sacrificed and the diagnosis of invasive CS was confirmed by macroscopic, histologic and genomic analyses. Our orthotopic CS PDO transplantation model has many potential applications for studying tumor biology and the response to treatment for CS in the pre-clinical setting. This may help identify targeted therapy for CS and potentially advance to Phase 1 human clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-03 Human-in-mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,Organoids,Orthotopic models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Arielle Katcher<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Charlie Chung<sup>2<\/sup>, Megan Gorman<sup>1<\/sup>, Brian Yueh<sup>2<\/sup>, Scott Lyons<sup>2<\/sup>, Joseph Merrill<sup>2<\/sup>, Libia Garcia<sup>2<\/sup>, Marina Frimer<sup>1<\/sup>, Gary  L.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for about 90% of primary liver cancer cases and is one of the leading causes of death from cancer worldwide. Establishing animal models that faithfully replicate the human disease is critical to improve our understanding of HCC pathogenesis and to test new therapeutic strategies. Here, we describe a novel human HCC model using genetically modified human hepatocytes in a humanized liver mouse. Primary human hepatocytes (PHH) were modified <i>ex vivo<\/i> through lentivirus or Lipid Nanoparticle (LNP)-mediated delivery of CRISPR\/Cas9 components, resulting in over-expression of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. These genetically engineered PHH were engrafted into the livers of FSRG (FAH<sup>-\/-<\/sup>, SIRPa<sup>hu<\/sup><sup>\/hu<\/sup>, RAG2<sup>-\/-<\/sup>, IL2Rg<sup>-\/-<\/sup>) mice, developed by Regeneron VelociGene technology, in which mouse liver parenchyma can be replaced with human hepatocytes. Tumor formation was validated in livers engrafted with human hepatocytes after different combinations of genetic modification, including over-expression of cMYC plus HRAS<sup>v12<\/sup>, and cMYC over-expression together with p53 KO. Tumor progression could be monitored by measuring human Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) in serum of engrafted mice. Liver tumors were positive for fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) and human Asialoglycoprotein Receptor 1 (ASGR1), confirming their human origin, as well as the proliferation marker, Ki67, and Glypican-3 (GPC3), which is frequently over-expressed in HCC and a potential therapeutic target. In these studies, mice were engrafted with a mix of lentivirus-transduced and non-transduced hepatocytes, resulting in humanized livers with both normal and transformed human hepatocytes, providing an ideal system to recapitulate neoplastic transformation and clonal expansion of human hepatocytes carrying oncogenic mutations as well as to test the specificity of novel therapies. By combining genetic manipulation of human hepatocytes with the FSRG humanized liver mouse platform, we have established a flexible system to model clinically relevant combinations of HCC mutations for both new target discovery and therapeutic testing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-03 Human-in-mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,Modeling,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Orthotopic models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Marisa Carbonaro<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Ciro Bonetti<sup><\/sup>, Hui Huang<sup><\/sup>, Kehui Wang<sup><\/sup>, Mathieu Desclaux<sup><\/sup>, Guochun Gong<sup><\/sup>, John C.

Models are developed by the NCI PDMR in decreasing order of complexity, specifically 1) patient material can be used to develop PDXs, PDOrgs, PDCs, and CAFs, 2) PDX material for PDOrgs and PDCs, and 3) PDOrg material for PDCs, but a PDC is never used to develop a PDOrg or PDX. Eleven pairs of 22 matched PDCs have been developed in parallel from either patient, PDX, patient-derived organoid, or PDX-derived organoid tumor material and sequenced by WES and RNASeq. Genetic stability was assessed using multiple approaches including microsatellite instability (MSI) generated from MSISensor2, percentage of genomic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) using a set of ~800k heterozygous SNPs from a population level genomic database (gnomAD), pairwise Spearman correlation based on BIN level copy number (CN)\/RNA expression profiles, and OncoKB annotated oncogenic\/likely oncogenic variants. No systematic differences were observed within PDC pairs derived from different origins or compared to their patient and\/or PDX material in MSI, LOH% and RNA expression profile but pairwise Spearman correlation (0.66-0.88) in CNV profiles were somewhat variable, likely due to low sequencing depth. In one PDC pair (299254), 3 out of 12 OncoKB annotated Indels and CNV showed opposite level of variant allele frequencies\/CN when comparing a model derived from patient material to one developed from a PDX-derived organoid, possibly driven by a lineage-specific subclonal outgrowth when compared to patient and PDX data. Phenotypic characteristics of matched PDCs also overall show no major differences, though variability in growth rates and the ability to form spheroids in serum-free medium were noted. In one pair (919269), the PDC derived from patient material was able to form a cell line xenograft (CLX) in NSG mice but not the PDC developed from a patient-derived organoid. Overall, these models demonstrate a high degree of concordance at the genetic and phenotypic level when compared to the originating patient and\/or PDX tumor. Though further characterization (e.g., preclinical drug testing) may be needed to define differences between matched PDC pairs, lack of access to patient tissue or failure to generate tumor cell cultures from one source of material should not hamper development of preclinical in vitro models from other patient-derived model types as long as the source-of-origin is clearly defined.

Lung cancer often metastasizes to the brain, significantly reducing life expectancy. Up to 7% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) already have brain metastasis when they are first diagnosed, and 20%-40% of patients with NSCLC will develop this complication during disease progression. Currently there are no targeted therapies specific for brain metastases, and the blood-brain barrier can pose a physiologic impediment to many cytotoxic drugs and antibody-based therapies. Here, we will discuss the development and use of xenograft models to address metastatic brain disease via a direct intracranial implant coupled with a subcutaneous &#8220;primary&#8221; tumor to effectively allow evaluation of the response to treatment at both locations. Treatment with targeted therapies could have significantly different penetration and absorption rates, which will alter pharmacokinetic and\/or pharmacodynamic (PK\/PD) assessment across either tissue. The dual implant technique can be a powerful tool to assess the simultaneous impact of treatment on established metastatic disease and primary tumor. We have characterized the dual disease induction parameters for two human NSCLC cell lines: NCI-H1975-Luc and PC-9-Luc. Both cell lines have been transfected with luciferase to allow for bioluminescence imaging (BLI) to monitor the intracranial disease progression. Both NCI-H1975-Luc and PC-9-Luc are of interest to the research community due to their unique mutational EGFR T790M status. Consistent with the historical and published data, the H1975-luc and PC-9-luc models behaved as expected, producing reliable tumor progression with minimal intragroup variability. In each case, subcutaneous tumors (primary site) reached an evaluation size of ~1000 mm<sup>3<\/sup> in ~20 days, and intracranial tumors (metastatic site) exhibited a total flux doubling time of ~2 days by BLI. Treatment with Osimertinib, an approved first-line treatment for EGFR+ NSCLC patients, was effective against both the subcutaneous and intracranial tumors. Treatment with Osimertinib at 25 mg\/kg, given orally, produced 100% complete regressions (CR) against the subcutaneous tumors, which never re-grew prior to study termination on Day 26 post implant and 100% partial regressions (PR) against the established intracranial tumors, which re-grew following the conclusion of treatment at the same rate as the control brain tumors. These data show a difference between the responsive nature of subcutaneous and intracranial NSCLC tumors representing the difference in responsiveness of primary tumors and brain metastases.

Humanized mouse models offer a unique tool to assess the anti-tumor response by recapitulating aspects of human tumor biology. Humanized mice are created by injecting either human CD34<sup>+<\/sup> hematopoietic stem cells or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) into an immunodeficient mouse strain. Here we utilized a PBMC humanized NCG mouse model to investigate human T-cell mediated anti-tumor response (&#62;95% CD3<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells by day 21). The challenges encountered with this model include the onset of graft versus host disease (GvHD) and donor variability leading to donor specific engraftment rates. Consistency is required with humanized PBMC models to ensure their use as an appropriate research model. Therefore, we examined the relationship between donor selection and engraftment rates as well as the onset of GvHD. Inter-donor variability was assessed by collecting PBMCs from multiple healthy donors. Intra-donor consistency was assessed by collecting PBMCs from the same donors at subsequent collections and comparing to initial human immune cell profiling by flow cytometry. NCG mice were injected with 1x10<sup>7 <\/sup>PBMCs from individual donors. Animals were weighed three times a week to monitor for changes in body weight and general health status. Peripheral blood was collected at day 9, 21 and 42 for flow cytometry screening of human immune cell engraftment (hCD45<sup>+<\/sup>, hCD3<sup>+<\/sup>, hCD4<sup>+<\/sup> and hCD8<sup>+<\/sup>) at the initial collection. Human PBMCs isolated from additional collections from the same donors were also injected into NCG mice and flow cytometry was performed on the new cell lots at day 21. Donors were grouped into categories based on engraftment rates, which were donor dependent. Donor variability is an important aspect to consider when humanizing mice with human PBMCs. PBMC humanized models are important for the study of pre-clinical therapeutics, but donor engraftment rates must be considered when engrafting the mice to create a consistently humanized mouse.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-03 Human-in-mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,Human,Peripheral blood mononuclear cell,PBMC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Steven Bronson<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jenny Rowe<sup><\/sup>, Christoph Eberle<sup><\/sup>, Stephen Festin<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Wilmington, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3f0170cf-6156-42fe-9bb0-7fb83cb148b0","ControlNumber":"8143","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Continual focus is placed on developing new treatments for cancer, including breast, lung and colon cancer, which are the most common worldwide. Humanized mice are an important <i>in-vivo<\/i> animal model that recapitulate crucial aspects of human tumor biology and anti-tumoral immunity allowing for assessment of immunotherapies. Currently these models are primarily created using cord blood, which is in limited supply. This leads to the isolation of low numbers of hCD34+ stem cells, resulting in small cohorts of animals. This limitation represents a challenge in working with humanized mice making it important to consider alternative sources of hCD34+ stem cells. In this study, we compared NCG mice engrafted with an alternative source of adult healthy donor mobilized hCD34+ stem cells to those engrafted with cord blood derived hCD34+ stem cells.After evaluating engraftment kinetics between the two cell sources we examined the anti-tumoral effect of an anti-human PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor in mice bearing three different human tumor xenograft cell lines (CDX) (A549 lung, COLO-205 colon and MDA-MB-436 breast cancer). NCG mice were humanized using either cord blood derived or adult healthy donor mobilized hCD34+ stem cells. Levels of human immune cell engraftment were measured in peripheral blood using multi-color flow cytometry. Humanized NCG mice were implanted subcutaneously with cancer cells, and tumor bearing mice (TBM) were randomized into treatment groups when the average tumor size reached comparable volumes for each tumor type. Vehicle control mice were treated with isotype control IgG antibody, whereas TBM were dosed with anti-hPD-1 antibody. Clinical observations, body weights and tumor growth kinetics were recorded throughout the study. At the time of euthanasia whole blood, spleen and tumor tissues were collected and processed for immune profiling by multi-color flow cytometry. Adult healthy donor mobilized hCD34+ humanized mice have sustained humanization levels out to 34 weeks post-injection and can be successfully engrafted with human CDX tumors. The ability to monitor tumor growth kinetics and observe a response to an anti-hPD-1 checkpoint inhibitor across multiple tumor types indicates that NCG mice humanized with adult healthy donor mobilized CD34+ stem cells are useful when assessing immunotherapies. Future directions of this model will expand beyond monotherapies to include the evaluation of additional treatment methods such as bispecific antibodies and cell-directed therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-03 Human-in-mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mouse models,Human,CD34,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jenny Rowe<sup><\/sup>, <b>Steven Bronson<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Christoph Eberle<sup><\/sup>, Ann Fiore<sup><\/sup>, Bob Mihalek<sup><\/sup>, Stephen Festin<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Wilmington, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"768ca3f5-d589-4b1d-89ff-943a28332bf6","ControlNumber":"8021","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

These PDMs are clinically annotated with molecular information available in an easily accessible database for the extramural community. A key effort in developing these models is to develop matched models sets allowing for larger scale screening efforts using 2D or 3D models to prioritize selection of PDX models for preclinical translational research. To date, over 220 model sets with a PDX, PDOrg, and PDC from a single patient have been developed; 40 of these have matched CAF models allowing for exploration of research questions focused on tumor microenvironment. The largest model sets are in colorectal cancer (COADREAD, n=76), gynecologic cancers (n=33), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD, n=29), melanoma (MEL, n=19), and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC, n=17). Every model undergoes several quality control assessments that serve as go\/no-go criteria including pathology assessment, STR validation, NGS concordance assessment and for PDXs, human:mouse DNA content assessment. It should be noted that not every model is successful in the development or QC phase so additional model sets with only one or two of the model types are also available for researcher requests, for example there are over 125 PDX\/PDOrg matched model sets. The NCI is currently performing parallel preclinical screening of PDXs and PDCs or PDOrgs to determine the ability of the in vitro lines to predict in vivo activity. Genetic and histopathologic assessment of these matched model sets have demonstrated a high degree of stability by somatic mutation, copy number alteration (CNA) and gene expression data. Gene expression correlation analysis shows that mean of Spearman r between PDXs 0.89, between matched PDC\/PDXs 0.79, and between matched PDOrg\/PDXs 0.82. As expected, some variation at the gene expression level when comparing PDX to in vitro cultures by t-SNE can be observed, likely due to the differences in culture conditions.

Overall, compared to NSG mice, the absolute counts were similar for all immune subsets measured except for regulatory T cells (Tregs). B-NDG, NCG, and CIEA NOG mice had reduced Treg numbers in the spleen of tumor-bearing mice. In the tumor, Treg numbers were lower in the B-NDG and CIEA NOG mice. No differences were observed for any immune subset in the blood.<br \/>Overall, the tumor growth kinetics of BT-474 in B-NDG mice was most similar to historical data using NSG mice.

Historically, immunodeficient mice have been the standard rodent species for cancer xenograft modeling. However, an immunodeficient rat that supports a wide variety of human cancer cell types would provide a larger rodent strain for easier surgical manipulation, serial blood sampling, and provide a single model in which efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology can be performed. We have created a Sprague Dawley <i>Rag2 -\/-, Il2rg -\/- <\/i>rat (<i>SRG<sup>TM<\/sup> OncoRat&#174;) <\/i>that provides a highly supportive environment for growing tumors of human origin. The SRG rat lacks B, T, and NK cells and readily supports the growth of multiple human cancer cell lines. The SRG rat is more immunodeficient than the Nude rat, suggesting it may be permissive to a wider variety of human cancer types. Here we demonstrate the utility of the SRG rat for both subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft modeling. The SRG rat supports the growth of both lung and liver orthotopic cancers. In addition, the SRG rat supports the growth of orthoptic human glioblastoma multiforme in the brain. We use <i>in vivo<\/i> imaging to visualize tumor establishment and growth in subcutaneous, orthotopic, and metastatic models. Furthermore, our data show the ability of the SRG rat to support the growth of multiple different human cancer cell types subcutaneously in two different matrices, Matrigel<b><i>&#174;<\/i><\/b> and VitroGel<b><i>&#174;<\/i><\/b>. These data confirm that the SRG rat is an excellent host for studying human cancer. Our data demonstrate that the SRG rat has a high utility for studies using in vivo imaging, orthotopic tumor implantation, and standard subcutaneous tumor modeling.

We systematically evaluated and compared the response rates of MiniPDX&#174; assays and PDX assays pair-wise in 26 PDX models across 3 types of cancers to 12 clinically relevant regimens for chemical and targeting drugs. The results showed a high correlation between drug responses of the two assays, with sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 93%, respectively. More studies of different tumor types showed that MiniPDX drug sensitivity test results were consistent with clinical responses in most patients, which indicated that MiniPDX&#174; models have great potential in guiding personalized cancer therapy. LIDE has completed over 3,000 MiniPDX&#174; tests for clinical precision medicine, covering more than 50 indications. MiniPDX&#174; was used to rank clinically approved drugs or drug regimens to guide the selection of the best individualized treatment strategy. At the same time, screening other compounds facilitates selection of the best drug candidates for further R&#38;D. Importantly, performing MiniPDX&#174; Mouse Trial using fresh tumor samples generated from clinic is beneficial for determination of potential clinical indications. Only thousands of fresh cells leftover from MiniPDX&#174; preparation are sufficient to get genomic and transcription data by OncoVee&#8482; K-cell technology. The combination of MiniPDX&#174; assay and omics data would be very useful for determination of potential bio-markers in order to distinguish responders and non-responders in population with certain indication(s) and leveraged for patient stratification and selection criteria in clinical trial design. Currently, we are developing a new version of MiniPDX&#174; assay for immunotherapy (IO-FIVE, Immuno-Oncology Fast In Vivo Efficacy test) by using fresh patient cancer cells with autologous immune cells to maximally mimic human tumor microenvironment before seeding in immune-deficient mice.

Prognosis is poor in patients with advanced or metastasized RCC. Drug resistance towards Standard of Care (SoC, incl. everolimus, sorafenib, or sunitinib) drugs develops frequently within months. Therefore, development of novel options to target acquired TKI resistance mechanisms in advanced and metastatic RCC is still an urgent medical need. Preclinical models with high translational relevance can promote the implementation of novel personalized therapies. To evaluate novel targeted therapies and their combinations in preclinical settings, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models represent valuable tools. Responsible local ethics committees approved usage of patient tissue and all animal procedures. In this study, RCC tissue from 167 patients was collected and xenotransplanted in mice. Partially, a multi-region approach, xenografting tissue from different regions of one tumor, was used. PDX models were characterized by immunohistochemistry (Ki-67, CD31, Pax2 and Pax8 antibodies), gene expression, copy number variations and mutational analyses. To evaluate in vivo drug response of RCC PDX models, mice transplanted with PDX tumors were treated with bevacizumab (i.p.), with everolimus, sorafenib, or sunitinib (p.o.). Adopted clinical response criteria for solid tumors (RECIST) were applied to classify the anti-tumor activity of the tested compounds in RCC PDX models. Next generation sequencing (NGS, panel) and transcriptome data were used to compare primary tumors and metastases. A comprehensive panel of subcutaneous RCC PDX models with well-conserved molecular and pathological features over multiple passages was established. The overall take for the RCC PDX in this study was 21%. Tumor growth characteristics were heterogeneous throughout the different models but were stable during in vivo passaging. Drug screening towards four SoC drugs, targeting the VEGF and PI3K\/mTOR pathway, revealed individual and heterogeneous response profiles in the PDX, resembling the clinical situation. Intra-tumor heterogeneity can be assessed via PDX models from multi-tumor regions from one patient in our platform. Development of corresponding <i>in vitro<\/i> cell culture models from the PDX enables advanced high throughput drug screening in a personalized context. Analyzing novel targeted molecules is possible due to the pre-established molecular characterization of the PDX at the genomic and expression level. In conclusion, we established a new and molecularly characterized panel of RCC PDX models with high relevance for translational preclinical research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-03 Human-in-mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Renal cell carcinoma,preclinical platform,personalized therapy,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dennis Kobelt<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Dennis Gürgen<sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Becker<sup>1<\/sup>, Mathias Dahlmann<sup>1<\/sup>, Susanne Flechsig<sup>1<\/sup>, Elke Schaeffeler<sup>2<\/sup>, Florian A.

Informative pre-clinical testing of these approaches can be greatly facilitated using immune competent animals with spontaneous tumors. Pet dogs are immunologically outbred, immune competent and develop spontaneous tumors such as non Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma, glioblastoma, osteosarcoma, urothelial carcinoma and melanoma that share remarkable clinical, biological and genetic features with their human counterparts. As such, pre clinical testing of therapeutic approaches in dogs with cancer promises to accurately inform human clinical trial design. For this comparative approach to provide maximum information to accelerate human clinical translation of novel combination therapies and identify correlative biomarkers of therapeutic response, it is necessary to develop research tools for deep interrogation of the canine tumor microenvironment (TME). Here we present spatial transcriptomic analysis of multiple canine tumor and tissue types using GeoMx&#174; digital spatial profiler (DSP) Canine Cancer Atlas (CCA) panel.<br \/>Methods: FFPE slides or tissue microarrays were used to profile tumor and normal tissue from canines. Each slide was stained with tissue specific immunofluorescent antibodies, including Pan-cytokeratin, CD45, Vimentin, IBA1, CD3, and\/or CD68. Regions of interest were selected to assess the TME and normal tissue as possible. Slides were then run on the DSP using the CCA panel that contains 1900-canine specific genes using standard DSP methods.<br \/>Results: We were able to spatially detect over 1700 genes across multiple tissue types from canines, including osteosarcoma, glioblastoma, melanoma and normal tissues. Genes were detected in spatial compartments including malignant tumor, tumor stroma and normal tissue.<br \/>Conclusions: Together the GeoMx CCA allow for interrogation of the TME of multiple tumor types and has the potential to inform spatial biomarkers for response to therapy, as well as translate the effectiveness of these therapies to humans.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-08 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Gene expression,Translation,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sarah  E.

A small subpopulation of cancer cells that survives by reversibly switching to quiescence, is often responsible for relapse\/metastasis. Our goal is to model this resistant phenotype in cell culture, i.e., an ability to opportunistically switch between proliferation and quiescence. Cell culture models are convenient for mechanism-based manipulation and therapeutic evaluation. However, the major drawback is that typical cell culture conditions promote the proliferation of cancer cells irrespective of their fitness to survive in the body. To remedy this drawback, we have developed a strategy that eradicates majority (&#62;99.99%) of cells in aggressive triple-negative breast cancer cell lines under a prolonged metabolic challenge (a lack of glutamine). Importantly, this selection protocol enriches highly adaptable rare cancer cells that survive in reversible quiescence. This function-based approach is good at modeling cell fitness in cell culture. Here we investigated whether the approach is generalizable to other solid cancers by evaluating two aggressive melanoma cell lines- a human melanoma cell line A375SM and a mouse melanoma cell line B16-BL6. We found that, similar to the results obtained with triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, a lack of glutamine in culture medium eradicated majority of cells in both melanoma cell lines. Rare melanoma cells persisted in quiescence and then proliferated indefinitely. To determine whether the surviving melanoma cells have characteristics of resistant cancer, we asked whether they are resistant to paclitaxel. We found that surviving melanoma cells, both A375SM-MA and B16-BL6-MA (MA for metabolic adaptability), are more resistant to paclitaxel than parental unselected cells. Our protocol to test paclitaxel resistance was optimized to assess whether the increased resistance was due to an ability of melanoma cells to survive in quiescence. The protocol involved treatment of melanoma cells with different concentrations of paclitaxel and then following surviving cells under a microscope for several weeks. After prolonged treatment with paclitaxel, we observed rare non-proliferating cells that would yield colonies upon removal of paclitaxel. In this manner, we found that both A375SM-MA and B16-BL6-MA cell lines had an increased ability to survive in quiescence while maintaining a robust ability to proliferate. We conclude that the function-based strategy presented here may be broadly applicable across resistant heterogeneous cancers for modeling a clinically relevant cancer cell phenotype in cell culture, i.e., an opportunistic switching between quiescence and proliferation. This model is suitable for evaluating therapies to overcome deep intrinsic resistance in cancer.

Black males tend to smoke less, but have a 37% higher chance of developing lung cancer. The three most common histological subtypes of lung cancer are lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), squamous cell lung cancer (LUSQ), and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). To study lung cancer development, progression, and treatment, numerous tools are needed, including lung cancer cell lines. We undertook a literature and web-based investigation of lung cancer cell line availability from different racial\/ethnic groups. We identified 188 cell lines from White individuals, 374 cell lines from Asian subjects, but only 26 cell lines from Blacks and none from Hispanic patients. We conclude that Black and Hispanic lung cancer cell lines are strongly underrepresented. Here we focus on LUAD cell lines since LUAD is the most common histological subtype in all racial\/ethnic groups. While 67 White LUAD cell lines have been established, we only identified 5 Black LUAD lines. To remedy this lack of Black LUAD cell lines, we are collecting LUAD samples from Black patients to establish new cell lines (with full consent). In addition, we aim to increase the representation of Black cell lines by creating isogenic cell line variants of existing cell lines, like NCI-H23. NCI-H23 was derived from a Black male patient and carries a <i>KRAS<\/i><sup>G12C<\/sup> heterozygous mutation. We are using CRISPR\/CAS9-based genome editing to introduce amino acid substitutions, including <i>KRAS<\/i><sup>G12V <\/sup>and <i>KRAS<\/i><sup>G12A<\/sup>. Our gene editing DNA includes a silent restriction site to help identify edited clones. A fluorescently labeled structured tracrRNA is included during the genomic editing process, allowing the electroporated cells to undergo fluorescence-activated cell sorting. We use the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the relevant genomic region, followed by restriction digestion to identify potential clones and sequencing to confirm successful editing. Several clones are currently under evaluation. Once new hetero- and homozygous <i>KRAS<\/i> mutants have been identified, we will test the efficacy of polyisoprenylated cysteinyl amide inhibitors (PCAIs). PCAIs have been shown to disrupt the RAS-mediated signaling pathway in racially\/ethnically diverse cell lines (manuscript submitted). By generating newly-established and isogenic Black LUAD cell lines, we intend to ensure that potential therapeutics are tested on cell lines with the appropriate racial\/ethnic genetic background. In the future, we hope to establish similar cell lines from Hispanic LUAD subjects.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-08 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Lung adenocarcinoma,Cell lines,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Christopher Leon<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Matthew  A.

Animal models are often pointed at as the culprits for failure in clinical trials. While better animal models for cancer are needed and constantly developed, the incentive of drug developers to use those might not be clear, because the regulatory authorities do not require it. Subcutaneous tumors have earned their place in drug development but adding more sophisticated models to the testing panel before entering the clinical phase should improve the success rate. We present here the properties of subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor growth in two syngeneic models. HM-1 murine ovarian cancer cells were inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) and intraperitoneally (representing the stage of intraperitoneal carcinomatosis) and murine renal adenocarcinoma Renca cells s.c. and orthotopically within the renal capsule. Body weight and tumor growth were followed, and mice were sacrificed according to humane endpoint criteria. To compare tumor growth in s.c. sites and within the abdomen, the tumor weight at sacrifice was divided by the number of days since the inoculation. In the HM-1 model, the mice with intraperitoneal tumor were sacrificed due to build-up of ascites on average six days earlier that the mice with s.c. tumor. In s.c. HM-1 tumor-bearing mice, the reason for sacrifice was tumor ulceration. In the Renca model, the s.c. and intrabursal models were approximately the same length. There was a striking difference in the tumor growth rate (mg\/day) in s.c. versus abdominal sites in both models. The growth was 4-5 times faster in the abdominal sites than subcutaneously, highlighting the effect of tumor specific microenvironment. It is easy to understand that having promising results might be easier in a slower growing model. However, since both ovarian and renal cancer show very different growth kinetics within the abdominal cavity, testing drug candidates aimed for those indications in orthotopic models before accessing the clinical trials could give a more relevant evaluation of the potency of the drug candidates.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-08 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Renal cell carcinoma,Mouse models,Orthotopic models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mari I.

It arises from the transformation of melanocytes, and despite the effective treatment of the ocular tumor, hepatic metastases lead to a poor prognosis. Our hypothesis is that the invasive potential and therapeutic resistance of UM cells (UMCs) depend on interactions with stromal cells and properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Our study aims to determine the impact of UMCs in stromal cell activation, and to define the role of the ECM produced by choroidal fibroblasts or hepatic stellate cells (HSteCs) on UM cell proliferation and invasion.<br \/>Methods: Two types of tumor spheroids were generated i) one corresponding to primary melanoma (UMCs from eye tumor + choroidal fibroblasts and endothelial cells) and ii) the other to liver metastasis (UMCs from liver metastasis + HSteCs and sinusoidal endothelial cells). The organization of these mixed spheroids were studied by confocal microscopy using the following markers: Melan-A (UM cells), alpha-smooth muscle actin (aSMA; activated fibroblasts and stellate cells), CD31 (endothelial cells) and Ki67 (proliferation). The viability and invasion capacity of the mixed spheroids were analyzed using an ATP consumption assay, and the measurement of the invasion area in Matrigel. Next, two types of matrices were produced by tissue engineering using the self-assembly approach with choroidal fibroblasts or HSteCs. These matrices were devitalized and characterized by confocal microscopy (collagens, fibronectin), before seeding UMCs to study their morphology, proliferation and ECM remodeling.<br \/>Results: A higher concentration of alpha-SMA and proliferative cells were observed in the outer layers of the spheroids by immunofluorescence analyses. Choroidal and hepatic matrices were produced in 21 days. These tissue-engineered matrices contained fibronectin and collagen I. These devitalized matrices were seeded with UMCs in monolayer to study their change of morphology, proliferative state and ECM remodeling.<br \/>Conclusions: We characterized the viability and cellular organization in both choroidal and hepatic spheroid models, and successfully generated tissue-engineered choroidal and hepatic matrices. With the optimization of these 3D<br \/>models, we will better understand the steps involved in the progression of ocular melanoma to a metastatic stage. These complex models may replace the 2D model using tumor cells in monolayer for future drug screening, which will consider the impact of the microenvironment on UM therapeutic resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-08 Other animal and cell models of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Spheroids,Microenvironment,Extracellular matrix,3D cell culture,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Olivier Chancy<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Léo Piquet<sup><\/sup>, Kelly Coutant<sup><\/sup>, Andrew Mitchell<sup><\/sup>, Solange Landreville<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Ophtalmology, CHU de Québec - Universite Laval, Québec, QC, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"404e04d3-9086-48c0-8f2e-b05bf0f7e4f1","ControlNumber":"7645","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>O.

With this increase comes a need for validated immunodeficient animal models that allow engraftment of tumor xenografts, an important role in the drug development process. Immunodeficient rats are suited for studies that require serial tissue sampling such as blood. Under NIH guidelines, up to 88&#181;l of whole blood from a 125g rat can be collected per day compared to 21&#181;l of blood from a 30g mouse. Tumor size endpoints in rats are also larger at 40mm in diameter compared to 20mm in mice, contingent on other humane endpoints. This allows researchers to follow drug response or toxicology within the same animal over more frequent time intervals. The SRG is an immunodeficient rat with deletions in the recombination activating gene 2 (<i>Rag2<\/i>)<i> <\/i>and interleukin 2 receptor gamma (<i>Il2r-<\/i><i>&#947;<\/i>) that results in impaired V(D)J recombination and lymphocyte maturation respectively, ensuring T, B and NK cells deficiency. In this study, we set out to examine the levels of monocytes, another key component of the immune system response as well as for immunophenotypic differences between male and female SRGs, which have not been done in previous studies. We further evaluated the growth kinetics of 20 human tumor cell lines from 12 different cancer types in the SRG.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> Whole blood was collected from 20 SRG rats of each gender (n=40) with 2 CD (Sprague Dawley) rats of each gender used as control group (n=4).

Tumor cell lines were inoculated subcutaneously into individual SRGs and tumor measurements obtained at regular intervals until study or humane endpoints.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> While levels of circulating T, B and NK cells in SRGs were reduced compared to WT CD rats (p&#60;0.05), no statistically significant difference was observed in monocyte subpopulation (p&#62;0.05). There was also no significant difference in T, B, NK cells as well as monocyte levels between male and female SRGs (p&#62;0.05). All 20 human tumor cell lines tested in the SRG engrafted successfully and demonstrated good growth kinetics with some tumors growing more than 10,000mm<sup>3 <\/sup>in size.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b> The immunodeficient SRG has demonstrated utility in supporting the engraftment of human tumor xenografts across 12 different cancer types.

This malignancy accounts for about 10% of cholangiocarcinoma cases and is the second most common primary liver cancer. Effective treatments for iCCA are limited, and they are primarily treated by tumor surgical resection. Regrettably, surgical resection is limited to early-stage disease and has an unfavorable prognosis. Development of novel therapeutic strategies for iCCA is needed to improve outcomes for non-resectable late stage iCCAs. Therefore, establishing suitable animal models for <i>in vivo<\/i> investigation of oncology and immuno-oncology treatment strategies for iCCA is critical.<br \/>Methods: The <i>Pten<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>GEMM was generated by CRISPR-Cas9 and crossed with <i>Alb-Cre<\/i> and <i>LSL-Kras<sup>G12D\/+<\/sup><\/i> mice.

Therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors were evaluated <i>in vivo<\/i> for tumor growth inhibition.<br \/>Results: Within 8 weeks, all GEMM models had developed iCCA, resulting in the death of the animals. Hepatomegaly and obvious jaundice were observed in all mice at the study endpoint. Multiple diffuse and firm tumorous lesions were observed on livers. Histological analysis of the liver showed the adenocarcinoma lesions were distributed throughout theliver. Severe liver damage was also reflected by increased ALT, AST and bilirubin levels in serum. Murine subcutaneous homograft models of iCCA were successfully established using the liver fragments abundant within tumorous lesions from the GEMMs. The established homograft models were stably passaged <i>in vivo<\/i> with pathological features resembling the original GEMM.

Individuals with LFS experience early tumor onset, often during childhood, with a cumulative lifetime cancer risk of 68% in males and 93% in females. Being prone to multiple cancer diagnoses, individuals with LFS endure frequent long-term multi-modal cancer screening protocols, which have improved survival through early detection but are non-specific and can be very burdensome. Preclinical animal models recapitulating the genomic landscape observed in LFS offer the potential to define cancer-driving mechanisms in LFS to personalize tumor surveillance, while also providing a preclinical platform for testing molecularly targeted therapies. Zebrafish are a powerful cancer research tool due to their high degree of genetic conservation; histological\/molecular similarities in tumor development with their human counterparts; optical clarity facilitating high-resolution imaging and non-invasive tumor screening.<br \/>Experimental Design: We have generated two <i>tp53 <\/i>zebrafish point mutants, R217H and R242H, (representing commonly mutated human LFS and sporadic residues, R248 and R273H) and obtained <i>tp53 <\/i>null mutants (Langenau lab).

R242H mutants exhibit earlier tumor onset and higher life-time incidence than both R217H and<i> <\/i>null mutants, suggesting that this mutation is more aggressive. Additionally, R217H and R242H mutants each present with a distinctive anatomic tumor distribution and skewed sex ratios, indicating different tumor-driving mechanisms.

Mouse mammary tumor models driven by overexpression of MYC, such as MMTV-Myc, also exhibit a rapid onset and high frequency of mammary tumors indicating that MYC overexpression plays an important role in driving breast carcinogenesis. However, the role of MYC in breast cancer initiation and subtype determination is not well understood. In the normal mammary gland, MYC is a critical regulator of and is essential for alveolar luminal epithelial cell differentiation during pregnancy. Aberrant MYC expression can promote improper alveolar development and milk production and is a potent inducer of cellular proliferation. Based on these known functions of MYC during development, we hypothesized that its overexpression may induce early changes in epithelial cell differentiation leading to pre-tumorigenic shifts in cell lineages that contribute to the formation of luminal breast tumors. To investigate this, we analyzed the mammary glands of MMTV-Myc (MYC) mice prior to any signs of tumor formation. As early as 5 weeks of age, MYC overexpression led to alterations at both the histological and cellular levels. Interestingly, pre-tumorigenic MYC glands phenotypically resembled mid-pregnant glands of WT mice. Specifically, pre-tumorigenic MYC glands demonstrated budding along the mammary ducts and expansion of a Sca1<sup>-<\/sup>\/CD49b<sup>-<\/sup> luminal epithelial cell subset not typically seen in nulliparous mice. RNA-seq was performed on luminal epithelial cells isolated from WT or pre-cancerous MYC mammary glands to define the luminal differentiation states upon MYC overexpression. While there was an overlap in twenty-nine genes that control milk production and cellular metabolism between pre-cancerous MYC luminal cells and those from mid-pregnant WT mice, luminal cells from MYC mice also exhibited a unique fingerprint of forty-one genes that overlap with cell states found in breast cancer. These uniquely expressed luminal cell genes may be important for MYC-regulated tumorigenesis. Ongoing and future experiments will investigate the role of specific MYC-target genes in mammary gland development versus tumor formation to clarify the role of MYC in these divergent processes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-02 Developmental phenotypes of cancer genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myc,Mammary gland,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jerrica Breindel<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kayla  M.

Skin tumor initiation and progression are associated with chronic exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, mainly for light-skinned individuals, that can activate different oncogenes and pathways. Solar UV-induced mutations, characterized by C to T or CC to TT mutations, are well described in the TP53 gene in human skin cancers such as &#8203;&#8203;basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma. This study evaluated TP53 mutations in 2201 canine tumors enrolled in FidoCure Precision Medicine Platform. Tumors were classified in 26 different types according to their histology and anatomic location. Gastrointestinal tumors, insulinomas and mesotheliomas did not carry any TP53 mutation as opposed to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and cutaneous hemangiosarcoma (CHSA) that had higher number of TP53 mutations in 88.9% and 77.8% of cases, respectively. Canine CSCC had a similar frequency of TP53 mutations compared to humans, previously identified in 83.64% of cases (MSKCC, Nat Med 2017). The C to T transitions were the most prevalent type of mutations in both canine CSCC and CHSA representing 66.67% and 55.55% of TP53 mutations, respectively. On the other hand, C&#62;T corresponded to just 23.36% of TP53 mutations for the other 24 tumor types. R261H, G290R, R184*, S229F, N143K and R201* variants were identified more than 10 times in all canine tumors. Canine CSCC and CHSA were enriched with R201* (P&#60;0.0001; P=0.004) and R184*(P&#60;0.0001; P=0.048). These two nonsense variants are C&#62;T changes at the position 601 and 550, respectively. They are homologous to human R213* (637C&#62;T) and R196* (586C&#62;T). Canine R201* was identified in 44.4% of CSCC, and human R213* in 73.91% of cases (MSKCC, Nat Med 2017). This study identified a high frequency of TP53 mutations in canine cutaneous tumors consistent with solar induced lesions. These results position canines as excellent spontaneous models of human solar induced cancers that can be utilized to elucidate elements of cancer biology, prognosis and responses across a wide spectrum of therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-04 Model organisms in drug discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TP53,Skin carcinogenesis,Modeling,Sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lucas Rodrigues<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Thaynan Vieira<sup><\/sup>, Garrett Harvey<sup><\/sup>, Dorothy Girimonte<sup><\/sup>, Gerald Post<sup><\/sup>, Lindsay Lambert<sup><\/sup>, Aubrey Miller<sup><\/sup>, Abigail Hull<sup><\/sup>, Chase Schwalbach<sup><\/sup>, Christina Lopes<sup><\/sup>, Michelle White<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>FidoCure, Palo Alto, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5133ff8d-2e77-4002-8d2b-c176051ce344","ControlNumber":"3896","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;L.

However, many cell lines have been cultured in serum-containing medium for decades, continuously accumulating genetic and epigenetic aberrations. Without a doubt, these cell lines have very little in common with the tumor they originate from, resulting in low biological and clinical relevance. Despite these drawbacks, cell lines are still the most frequent research tool when it comes to the use of <i>ex vivo<\/i> models. Yet, in light of higher consistency, reproducibility, and biological relevance, more and more researchers are paying attention to which cells and culture medium to use. Although primary cell cultures certainly reflect cellular and genetic heterogeneity of the original tumor, finding a suitable medium that supports their growth and maintains genetic heterogeneity remains challenging. To this end, we developed serum-free cell culture media to cultivate primary epithelial tumor cells of pancreatic, renal, and ovarian origin. Notably, generating <i>in vitro<\/i> models with high biological relevance was successful when using our media during the derivation and expansion of tumor cell lines from primary and xenotransplanted tumors. Here, we present another serum-free cell culture media supporting the in vitro growth of primary colon adenocarcinoma. Using this optimized medium, we had a 42% success rate in establishing a primary cell culture for a given tumor sample, higher than for any other media tested in our hands. Next to 2D cell culture, our formulation supports 3D tumoroid formation when cells are embedded in a basement membrane matrix. Furthermore, targeted sequencing of 486 tumor-associated genes revealed that more than 99% of the detected genetic variants in an early passage (p11) were also present after extended time in culture (p53). In summary, our new serum-free medium enables the efficient derivation and expansion of primary tumor and xenograft-derived colon adenocarcinoma cell cultures in 2D and 3D, yet retaining their genetic identity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB05-11 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell lines,Cell culture media,Colorectal adenocarcinoma,3D cell culture,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Benjamin Theek<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Anne Franke<sup>1<\/sup>, David Agorku<sup>1<\/sup>, Katharina Lamfried<sup>1<\/sup>, Nojan Jelveh<sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Linnebacher<sup>2<\/sup>, Lilian Martinez Carrera<sup>1<\/sup>, Olaf Hardt<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Miltenyi Biotec B.V. & Co.

However, standard process for target discovery using models such as outgrown cell lines and well-averaged readouts has yielded a less than 5% approval rate for drugs entering trials (Thomas <i>et al.<\/i> 2016 Bio.org).<br \/>Here, we describe patient-centric target discovery through the use of disease relevant primary OC samples and single cell functional characterization using a platform with proven hemonc translatability (Kornauth <i>et al.<\/i> 2021, Snijder <i>et al.<\/i> 2017). We integrate data from our functional drug testing platform under multiple drug perturbations with matching genomic and transcriptomic data to reveal associations with novel downstream regulators of sensitivity.<br \/>Methods: Sensitivity of the cancer cell compartment in primary malignant ascites samples (n = 20; 75% HGSOC) to 85 small molecule drugs, was evaluated using a proprietary and translatable deep learning-driven single cell imaging platform (Vladimer <i>et al.<\/i> 2017). Cancer cell sensitivity from the drugs was combined with WES, bulk-RNAseq and drug induced changes in phosphoproteome, and single cell RNAseq transcriptome to identify perturbed targets and pathways.<br \/>Results: Here we describe a family of TKIs including ALKi that induce cytotoxicity of cancer cells in primary samples, not previously captured in publicly available cell line drug sensitivity screening data (Iorio <i>et al.<\/i> 2016). We report novel sensitivity of OC driven by non-canonical targets of ceritinib such as FAK1 or IGF1R, mediated by the downstream signaling hub YBX1 (Kuenzi <i>et al.<\/i> 2017), involved in NFB pathway regulation (Motolani <i>et al.<\/i> 2021). Indeed, transcriptomic scRNA analysis upon ceritinib treatment of primary OC cells revealed rapid perturbation of numerous NFB pathway members, alongside YBX1 inactivation.<br \/>Conclusions: Combining functional endpoints and single cell-based differential expression analysis of primary OC samples, we have identified the NFB pathway and the regulator YBX1 as a promising novel sensitivity for HGSOC treatment development. These and several other important targetable nodes identified, sit outside the recently suggested JAK\/STAT pathway (Izar <i>et al.<\/i> 2020), thereby demonstrating a pipeline towards novel drug target and pathway discovery driven by patient-centric, disease relevant models of high-need indications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Target discovery,Ovarian cancer,Multiomics,Screening,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Irene Gutierrez-Perez<sup>1<\/sup>, Bekir Ergüner<sup>1<\/sup>, Pisanu Buphamalai<sup>1<\/sup>, Joost Van Ham<sup>1<\/sup>, Paul Heinz<sup>1<\/sup>, Valentin Aranha<sup>1<\/sup>, Rin Okumura<sup>1<\/sup>, Elisabeth Waltenberger<sup>1<\/sup>, Isabella Alt<sup>1<\/sup>, Claudia Baumgaertler<sup>2<\/sup>, Maja Stulic<sup>2<\/sup>, Edgar Petru<sup>3<\/sup>, Christoph Minichsdorfer<sup>4<\/sup>, Judith Lafleur<sup>5<\/sup>, Lukas Hefler<sup>5<\/sup>, Laudia Hadjari<sup>5<\/sup>, Lucia Dzurillova<sup>6<\/sup>, Jozef Sufliarsky<sup>6<\/sup>, Nikolaus Krall<sup>7<\/sup>, Thorsten Füreder<sup>4<\/sup>, <b>Gregory Ian Vladimer<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Bojan Vilagos<sup>1<\/sup>, Robert Sehlke<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Translational Research, Exscientia, Vienna, Austria,<sup>2<\/sup>Clinical Operations, Exscientia, Vienna, Austria,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria,<sup>4<\/sup>Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria,<sup>5<\/sup>Ordenslinikum Linz - Barmherzige Schwestern, Linz, Austria,<sup>6<\/sup>National Oncology Institute of Slovakia, Brataslava, Slovakia,<sup>7<\/sup>Precision Medicine, Exscientia, Vienna, Austria","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"abab98a2-1087-4e45-ad04-0db08a51ebcc","ControlNumber":"1758","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;I.
