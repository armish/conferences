[{"Abstract":"Lung cancer initiation and progression driven by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation has been extensively studied in the past decade. Though many leaps have been made in the field in terms of treatment, early diagnosis screening is not widely available or well established. Meanwhile, EGFR mutation is a significant driver of tumorigenesis and drug resistance. This receptor is related to many downstream pathways that influence cancer metabolism and the ability of tumor cells to adapt to changes in the tumor microenvironment. Our study finds that cancer metabolism plays a prominent role in the progression of tumorigenesis in early-stage lung cancer. Kynurenine, a metabolite from the tryptophan pathway, was highly upregulated in early-stage, EGFR-mutation driven lung cancer by metabolomic analysis. The connection between EGFR mutation and the upregulation of kynurenine remains largely unknown. We hypothesize that kynurenine, based on our preliminary data and as a ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, may have a dual role in early tumorigenesis. We propose that kynurenine may be used by tumor cells to modulate their response to stress by triggering anti-apoptotic pathways. Additionally, kynurenine may be used as a signaling molecule in the tumor microenvironment to allow the early tumor cells to evade immune detection through the transformation of macrophages from M1 to M2. Currently, our data show that indoleamine 2,3- dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), the rate-limiting enzyme of the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway, is significantly upregulated in early-stage, EGFR-driven lung cancer murine models by RNA-seq analysis. This supports our idea that IDO1 could help to modulate the response to cellular stress and to regulate the immune response to favor tumor development. We hope that IDO1 could be a potential clinical target and a potential biomarker for the dysregulation of this pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Early detection,Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),Metabolism,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alice Rodriguez-Fuguet<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Luis Silva<sup>1<\/sup>, John Asara<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiaoman Li<sup>3<\/sup>, Susumu Kobayashi<sup>2<\/sup>, Wen Cai Zhang<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, Division of Cancer Research, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Medicine, Division of Signal Transduction, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard University, Boston, MA,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Computer Science, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"da5f7c1f-6a0b-4b77-9d49-002489063a32","ControlNumber":"4711","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Myeloid cells are one of the most abundant cell types in both inflamed and non-inflamed tumors, and may contribute to immune checkpoint blockade resistance. The plasticity of macrophages enables them to directly and indirectly modulate T cell responses, and directly kill tumor cells via phagocytosis. This suggests that targeting myeloid cells could be an effective therapeutic approach. Class I PI3Ks are a family of dual specificity lipid and protein kinases. Unlike other class I PI3Ks, PI3K&#947; is predominantly expressed in myeloid cells. PI3K&#947; has been shown to be a key mediator that drives the immunosuppressive macrophage program by stimulating AKT\/mTOR signaling and promote C\/EBP&#946; expression while inhibiting NF-&#1082;B activity (Keneda MM. <i>Nature<\/i>. 2016;17:437-442). Here, we present the discovery and characterization of INCB098377, a potent and selective PI3K&#947; inhibitor. Specific inhibition of PI3K&#947; with INCB098377 may induce anti-tumor activity by reshaping the tumor immune microenvironment. <b><\/b> In cell-based assays, INCB098377 has an IC<sub>50 <\/sub>of 1.4 nM and is greater than 100-fold selective over other PI3K isoforms. It also shows a favorable PK profile in several animal species. Treatment of M2 polarized macrophages with INCB098377 resulted in changes towards a more pro-inflammatory phenotype. CD163 and CD206 were decreased, whereas HLA-DR and co-stimulatory CD80\/86 molecules were increased. MHC-I expression was unchanged, suggesting a role for these macrophages in MHC-II-mediated antigen presentation. Furthermore, INCB098377 treatment reduced macrophage-mediated immunosuppression and restored T cell proliferation in M2 polarized macrophages co-cultured with allogeneic human T cells. In vivo, significant tumor growth inhibition was observed with once-daily dosing of 10 mg\/kg INCB098377 in both syngeneic and humanized mouse tumor models without toxicity. Moreover, efficacy was observed in inflamed and non-inflamed tumor models. Consistent with the proposed mechanism of action, INCB098377 inhibited phospho-AKT levels in vivo and in human PBMCs. Treatment with INCB098377 induced pro-inflammatory responses without macrophage depletion suggests that robust tumor microenvironment changes are responsible for observed anti-tumor efficacy. In addition, INCB098377 inhibited neutrophil migration in the Carrageenan-induced paw inflammation model. INCB098377, a potent and selective inhibitor of PI3K&#947;, shows effective anti-tumor activity in a variety of mouse and humanized cancer models through the inhibition of immunosuppressive cells trafficking into the tumor, modulation of myeloid cell function, and enhancement of T cell proliferation.<br \/>Acknowledgments: Diana Alvarez Arias and Stephen Douglass contributed equally to this study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,PI3K,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Diana A.

One potential explanation is the lack of sufficient infiltration of antigen-specific T cells into the tumor. The few T cells that make their way into the tumor are met with a plethora of negative signals that suppress their activity and abrogate local T cell expansion. To overcome this limitation of intramuscular cancer vaccines, we have developed an approach using in situ vaccination with a combination of immune modulators and tumor antigens, all encoded by mRNAs and delivered using nanoparticles. In this study, we show the superior efficacy and immunogenicity of a locally delivered mRNA cancer vaccine over that of an intramuscular HPV16 cancer vaccine. Both routes of administration result in robust induction of antigen-specific T cells, but local administration of mRNA-encoded antigens and immune modulators also resulted in enhanced infiltration of immune cells into the tumor, local Th1\/M1 cytokine induction, and more-complete tumor clearance. Specifically, we found that the inclusion of the immunomodulators IL-12 and TNFSF14\/LIGHT enabled tumor clearance in a murine tumor model. While tumors treated with mRNA-encoded HPV16 antigen alone induced robust systemic antigen-specific responses, minimal levels of local T cell expansion and infiltration, proinflammatory cytokine induction, and tumor control were observed. By contrast, tumors treated with mRNA-encoded HPV16 antigen, IL-12p70, and TNFSF14 completely cleared large established HPV16 expressing tumors with long-lasting recurrence free survival and immune memory. This observation was replicated in in a second murine tumor model, confirming the superior potency of locally delivered mRNA cancer vaccines in combination with immunomodulators. Consequently, we are developing a locally administrated mRNA therapy for the treatment of patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Antitumor activity,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Weiqun Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Diane  M.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are representative TME-comprising immune suppressive cells and influence tumor growth and progression. TAMs are considered as an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy. However, current TAMs-targeting strategies are not sufficient to induce continuous antitumor responses. Here, we suggest a new strategy that can reprogram TAMs and further bridge innate-to-adaptive immunity by utilizing immunostimulatory CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs). In this study, we investigated the new role of TLR9 agonist CpG ODN as an immunotherapeutic agent and tested whether liposomal delivery of CpG could modulate the function of TAMs and lead to remodeling of the TME.<br \/>Methods: A liposome-based nanomaterial encapsulating CpG ODN was constructed. A small lipid nanoparticle (SLNP) used as the CpG delivery platform in this study was made of a cationic cholesterol derivative and two biocompatible phospholipids. The CpG-encapsulating SLNP (SLNP@CpG) was prepared by a thin-film formation and rehydration method. <i>In vitro<\/i> studies were conducted to assess whether SLNP@CpG could reprogram macrophages. To assess antitumor therapeutic efficacy of the SLNP@CpG, two subcutaneous tumor models were established in mice and tumor growth and survival rates of mice were monitored. For tumor rechallenge experiment, mice showing complete tumor regression were rechallenged with same cancer cells and their splenocytes were analyzed to confirm the development of immune memory. To elucidate the immunological mechanism of SLNP@CpG-mediated antitumor efficacy, changes of immune cell subpopulations in treated tumors were analyzed by flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: SLNP@CpG enhanced macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of cancer cells and tumor antigen cross-presentation, and skewed the polarization state of macrophages <i>in vitro<\/i>. Intratumorally injected SLNP@CpG exerted its therapeutic efficacy in an established E.G7-OVA tumor via uptake by TAMs. SLNP@CpG treatment significantly suppressed the E.G7 tumor growth and also considerably prolonged the survival of mice, with 83.3% of mice becoming tumor-free. Local administration of SLNP@CpG resisted E.G7 tumor rechallenge by inducing immunological memory and long-term antitumor immunity. Local administration of SLNP@CpG even exerted its antitumor efficacy in an aggressive B16-F10 melanoma by remodeling TME towards immune stimulation and tumor elimination.<br \/>Conclusion: Liposomal delivery of CpG via local treatment reprogrammed TAMs by enhancing phagocytic activity and repolarizing M2 to M1 phenotype and also reshaped immunosuppressive TME, leading to antitumor immunity and long-term memory responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Tumor associated macrophages,Liposomes,CpG oligodeoxynucleotides,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yujin Kim<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sangyong Jon<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Life Science Research Institute, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Biological Sciences, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2650f67b-90b1-4c27-8afb-3e8e9d12ee63","ControlNumber":"5709","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Unfortunately, deep remissions only occur in a select subset of patients. Cancer progression is common as many current immunotherapies only target one or two pathways, which can quickly lead to tumor resistance. Novel approaches that target several pathways concurrently are therefore needed to promote stronger responses in a wider patient population.<br \/>Our group has recently discovered that the protein Ubiquitin-specific protease 6 (USP6) upregulates multiple, distinct immunostimulatory pathways. Tumor cell-specific expression of USP6 significantly increases CXCL9, CXCL10, and CCL5 chemokine production that enhances cytotoxic immune cell recruitment. Simultaneously, USP6 also upregulates several ligands and receptors that promote immune cell activation and killing of tumor cells such as CD112, MICA\/B, ICAM1, and MHC Class I. In addition, USP6 increases the tumor cell&#8217;s sensitivity to immune-derived factors such as Type I and Type II interferons and TRAIL by raising the surface expression of their respective receptors. USP6 is hominid-specific and therefore requires xenografting human tumor cells into athymic, T-cell deficient nude mice. Despite the immunocompromised model, USP6 expression was found to increase immune cell recruitment to the tumor while repolarizing the immune microenvironment toward a more activated, tumor-suppressive state. Strikingly, immune cells in the peripheral blood were also affected with an increase in natural killer cell (NK) activation and a skewing of the myeloid population away from an immunosuppressive phenotype. Our group subsequently demonstrated that a USP6<sup>+<\/sup> tumor was able to inhibit the growth of a USP6<sup>-<\/sup> distal tumor, with a concordant increase in NK, macrophage, and dendritic cell activation in the distal USP6<sup>-<\/sup> tumor.<br \/>Given our data, we sought to translate USP6 into a novel immunotherapy. Delivery of mRNA encoding the USP6 protein recapitulates the immunostimulatory effects of USP6 <i>in vitro<\/i>. Intratumoral (I.T) injection of a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulating USP6 mRNA significantly inhibited Ewing sarcoma and acute myeloid leukemia growth in athymic mice, despite the model lacking a fully functional immune system. Moreover, I.T injection of USP6 mRNA LNPs inhibited the growth of a non-injected, distal tumor. Altogether, these data support that USP6 is a potentially powerful target and continued development of I.T USP6 mRNA LNPs as a novel immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,mRNA,Immunomodulation,Nanoparticle,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ian Henrich<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Margaret Billingsley<sup>2<\/sup>, Kanika Jain<sup>2<\/sup>, Laura Quick<sup>3<\/sup>, Rob Young<sup>3<\/sup>, Margaret Chou<sup>2<\/sup>, Michael Mitchell<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Blumberg Institute and Merlin Biotech, Philadelphia, PA,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA,<sup>3<\/sup>Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"274de24e-9c05-4c7b-9d8a-8080bb2852ab","ControlNumber":"2338","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>I.

Metastatic breast cancer is characterized by extensive infiltration of the tumor microenvironment (TME) with immunosuppressive cells, such as myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), that inhibit anti-tumoral immune cells and prevent effective activation of the adaptive immune system by ICIs. Previously, our group has shown in the breast TME that epigenetic reprogramming of MDSCs by entinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, decreases MDSC immunosuppressive function and enhances response to ICIs, in part mediated by altered signaling within the Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and Nuclear factor kappa B (NF&#954;B) axis. Next, we sought to examine the effects of entinostat on MDSC reprogramming in a distant metastatic TME. Using the syngeneic NT2.5LM NeuN mouse model of metastatic breast cancer, we established spontaneous lung metastases and treated with either vehicle or entinostat (5 mg\/kg by oral gavage, 5x \/week) for 3 weeks. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of macro-dissected lung metastases revealed a large MDSC population, and unsupervised pathways analysis of the MDSC cluster showed differential regulation of the IL6-JAK-STAT3 and TNF&#945;-signaling-via-NF&#954;B pathways upon entinostat treatment. In line with reports of crosstalk among STAT3, NF&#954;B, and AP-1 pathways regulating inflammation in breast cancer, we also found through scRNAseq differential expression of AP-1 subunits JunB and FOSL1 upon entinostat treatment. At the protein level, western blot analysis of isolated intratumoral MDSCs from lung metastases revealed decreased STAT3 phosphorylation upon entinostat treatment. Using J774M cells, an MDSC-like cell line, we found decreased JunB phosphorylation and decreased FOSL1 protein upon entinostat treatment. Furthermore, preliminary evaluation of imaging mass cytometry (IMC) from tumor biopsies in selected patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with entinostat during the clinical trial NCI-9844 confirmed decreased STAT3 phosphorylation in MDSCs. Taken together, we provide new evidence in the metastatic lung TME that implicates a STAT3-NF&#954;B-AP-1 mediated mechanism leading to decreased MDSC suppression. Evaluating this mechanism in MDSCs taken directly from treated lung metastases represents the most biologically relevant mechanistic study to date, and preliminary translation of findings in patients suggests that planned studies will lead to identification of the mechanism driving response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MDSC,Tumor microenvironment,Breast cancer,Signaling pathways,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Aaron G.

Several immunosuppressive signaling pathways can promote tumor growth by inhibiting anti-tumor immunity in TEM. Therefore, targeting the immunosuppressive signaling pathways is a potential cancer treatment. Recent studies reported that inhibition of oncoproteins could lead to reduced anti-tumor immunity in several cancers; therefore, it&#8217;s critical to identify the potential oncoproteins which can lead to enhanced anti-tumor immunity. Aurora-A is a serine\/threonine kinase that plays an important role in the centrosome, cell mitosis, and chromosome stability. Previous studies indicated that cancer patients with poor prognoses are associated with a high Aurora-A level in tumor cells. Inhibition of Aurora-A is considered as a promising strategy for cancer treatment. However, Aurora-A inhibitors have not had a breakthrough in phase II or phase III clinical trials. The role of Aurora-A in tumor immunity is still unclear. Here, we investigated the role of Aurora-A in tumor immunity.<br \/>Materials and Methods: shRNA was used to knock down Aurora-A, and Alisertib was added to inhibit Aurora-A. RT-qPCR and western blot were performed to determine the IL-16 expression. The secretion of cytokines was measured by cytokine array and ELISA. BALB\/c and NOD\/SCID mice were subcutaneously injected with CT26 and then administered daily with Alisertib or treated with anti-IL-16 antibody. The tumor-infiltrating immune populations were analyzed by flow cytometry. IHC and H\/E stain were performed to analyze Aurora-A expression and lymphocyte infiltration in human CRC specimens.<br \/>Results: CRC patients with lower lymphocyte infiltration and higher Aurora-A are associated with poor prognosis and vice versa. Knockdown of Aurora-A in CT26 promotes tumor growth in immunocompetent mice by inhibiting the infiltration and cytotoxic activity of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Aurora-A negatively regulates IL-16 expression in a kinase-dependent manner in CRC cells. Blockade of IL-16 by anti-IL-16 antibody can reverse the tumor growth and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell cytotoxic activity in Aurora-A knocked-down CT26 tumors. Alisertib can inhibit CT26 tumor growth and promote IL-16 secretion in TME in mice. A combination of Alisertib and IL-16 antibody can promote the therapeutic effect of Alisertib in CT26 tumors.<br \/>Conclusion: Tumor-intrinsic Aurora-A plays a diverse role in tumor progression depending on the status of lymphocyte infiltration in TME. Aurora-A can promote anti-tumor immunity via negatively regulating IL-16 in a kinase activity-dependent manner in hot CRC tumors. In tumors with high lymphocyte infiltration, Aurora-A inhibition can suppress cancer cell growth and reduce anti-tumor immunity; the combination of Aurora-A inhibitors and IL-16 antibodies may provide a novel and effective strategy for cancer therapy in hot tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aurora kinase,Colorectal cancer,Tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shiang-Jie Yang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ming-Derg Lai<sup>1<\/sup>, Liang-Yi Hung<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>The Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Biotechnology and Bioindustry Sciences, College of Bioscience and Biotechnology, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ca766094-adc6-436c-9670-bf9130d38117","ControlNumber":"4344","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Inactivating NF1 mutations result in hyperactivation of RAS-mediated signaling. NF1 patients develop benign tumors on the skin and along nerves in the spinal cord and brain, and ~10% of these progress to Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNST). Attempts to inhibit RAS-signaling to treat MPNST have not worked in clinical trials. Surgical removal is the only cure for MPNST, which is challenging due to large tumor size and\/or proximity to nerves. MPNSTs often recur, metastasize, and respond poorly to chemo- and radiotherapy. As a result, MPNSTs are the leading cause of death in NF1 patients. Immune Checkpoint Blockade (ICB) is an approach to treat inoperable, undruggable cancers. Immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs) terminate normal immune responses to prevent collateral tissue damage. Cancer cells hijack this mechanism and express ICPs to avoid immune detection. ICB disrupts this process, enhancing antitumor immunity. Monoclonal antibodies (mABs) that disrupt the interaction between Programmed Cell Death Receptor 1 (PD-1) and its ligand Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) are a widely used ICB therapy. Having a T cell-enriched hot tumor microenvironment (TME) is required for successful ICB. However, MPNSTs lack a T cell-inflamed TME and respond poorly to ICB therapy. Activation of the protein &#8220;stimulator of interferon genes&#8221; (STING) enhances anti-tumor immunity via induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thus increasing T cell infiltration into the TME. We hypothesized that reprogramming the MPNST TME by STING pathway activation would turn cold MPNSTs into hot tumors amenable to ICB.<br \/>Methods: We treated mouse MPNSTs with STING agonist or STING agonist + anti-PD-1\/anti-PD-L1 mAb. Tumor size was measured throughout treatment. The mice were sacrificed and tumor tissue was analyzed for STING pathway activation, T cell infiltration, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. MPNST allograft tumors in athymic mice were controls.<br \/>Results: STING pathway activation and increased T cell presence was observed in STING agonist-treated MPNSTs compared to vehicle-treated. MPNSTs treated with STING agonist alone or STING agonist + PD-1\/PD-L1 mAbs showed less tumor growth relative to vehicle. Importantly, STING agonist + PD-1\/PD-L1 mAb-treated tumors showed significant cell death increase while cell proliferation remained unchanged. Interestingly, tumors in athymic mice continued to grow despite treatment suggesting the antitumor effects seen in immunocompetent mice were mediated by T cells.<br \/>Conclusions: Our data show that MPNSTs can become T cell-rich tumors by activating STING signaling. Reprogramming the TME made MPNSTs susceptible to immune destruction by ICB therapy. Our studies support this novel treatment strategy for MPNST, an aggressive, deadly tumor for which no molecular therapy currently exists.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor (MPNST),Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1),Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nipunika Somatilaka<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Laasya Madana<sup>2<\/sup>, Ali Sadek<sup>3<\/sup>, Renee  M.

In transformed cells, TGF-&#946; signaling is frequently exploited to reshape the architecture of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and establish a fibrotic barrier that insulates the tumor from surrounding normal tissue. As a result, immunological threats to the tumor are restricted, as is the anti-tumorigenic potential of immunotherapeutic interventions. Clinically, TGF-&#946; hyperactivity is associated with immunotherapy resistance and poor outcome in a variety of malignancies. We hypothesize that TP-6379, an investigational small molecule inhibitor of TGFBR1, may remodel the TME to expand the access of tumor-seeking lymphocytes to tumor tissue. Herein we describe several anti-tumorigenic effects of TP-6379 observed in multiple mouse models of cancer both as a single agent, and in combination with immunotherapy. In an EMT6 syngeneic mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), we observed that tumor phospho-SMAD2\/3 (pSMAD2\/3) levels quickly declined post-TP-6379-treatment and were suppressed by 74% after 8 hours. Preclinical data showed TP-6379 plasma levels inversely correlated with pSMAD2\/3 suppression. TP-6379 alone was observed to inhibit tumor growth in EMT6 and 4T1 TNBC models, an activity that was enhanced when augmented by immunotherapy. In a Cloudman S91 syngeneic melanoma mouse model, there was a clear subset of mice that responded to combination treatment. Histological analyses of TNBCs and responsive melanomas showed that TP-6379 treatment conferred a loss of induration of tumors, increased vascularization, and increased infiltration of CD45+ leukocytes (including CD8+ T cells), particularly when combined with immunotherapy. High-throughput analyses of tumors uncovered an array of MHC class I and II factors that were observed elevated subject to TP-6379 treatment, an activity that was oftentimes enhanced when combined with immunotherapy. Collectively, these data suggest that TP-6379 may improve immune cell access to tumor tissue via TME remodeling and normalization of vascular networks. Thus, TP-6379 treatment may present a unique and multifactorial anti-tumor strategy, 1) as a single agent to improve anti-tumorigenic immunological responses, and 2) as a combination treatment to boost immunotherapeutic activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TGF-&#946;,Microenvironment,Immune response,Mouse,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>David  A.

We previously reported a chromogenic sequential immunohistochemical (IHC) platform enabling quantitative and spatial assessment of 29+ biomarkers in a single tissue section (Tsujikawa T et al. Cell Reports 2017, Banik G et al. Methods Enzymology 2020). Using this platform, densities, phenotypes, and distributions of tumor and immune cells were evaluated, comparing baseline and post-treatment specimens from the same individual treated by paclitaxel, carboplatin, and cetuximab (PCE) for advanced HNSCC (N = 30). Immune cell density analyses based on CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, helper T cells, regulatory T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, granulocytes revealed the presence of differential immune cell compositions, where immune profiles were divided into hypo-, lymphoid-, and myeloid-inflamed groups according to the same criteria as in our previous report (Tsujikawa et al. Cell Reports 2017). Lymphoid and hypo-inflamed groups exhibited significant tumor volume reduction, increased CD45<sup>+<\/sup> immune cell densities and elevated combined positive scores of PD-L1 at the post-treatment status, suggesting the potential involvement of immunogenic mechanisms related to therapeutic response. On the other hand, the myeloid group exhibited no significant tumor volume reduction, together with higher expression of HIF1&#945; and ZEB2 on tumor cells which are potentially associated with hypoxia and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In conclusion, longitudinal tissue-based monitoring revealed the presence of differential tumor-immune complexity profiles related to therapeutic efficacy and resistance. Hypo-inflamed profiles might require upfront chemo\/targeted therapy before immunotherapy, and myeloid-inflamed profiles might require myeloid cell-targeted therapies, mandating the establishment of rapid clinical assessment of tumor-immune microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Immunohistochemistry,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Cetuximab,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alisa Kimura<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Takahiro Tsujikawa<sup>1<\/sup>, Junichi Mitsuda<sup>1<\/sup>, Aya Miyagawa-Hayashino<sup>2<\/sup>, Hiroki Morimoto<sup>1<\/sup>, Sumiyo Saburi<sup>1<\/sup>, Kanako Yoshimura<sup>1<\/sup>, Gaku Ohmura<sup>1<\/sup>, Sigeyuki Mukudai<sup>1<\/sup>, Hikaru Nagao<sup>1<\/sup>, Yoichiro Sugiyama<sup>1<\/sup>, Hiroshi Ogi<sup>3<\/sup>, Saya Shibata<sup>4<\/sup>, Eiichi Konishi<sup>2<\/sup>, Kyoko Itoh<sup>3<\/sup>, Shigeru Hirano<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Departments of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Kyoto Prefectual University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Departments of Surgical Pathology, Kyoto Prefectual University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Departments of Pathology and Applied Neurobiology, Kyoto Prefectual University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>4<\/sup>SCREEN Holdings Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"61334ce7-9478-4e5c-9045-dcb2d19f65cb","ControlNumber":"941","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

The chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin and its PEGylated liposomal nanoparticle formulation (PLD) have been shown to target myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the TME. In this preclinical work, we investigated whether PLD improves response to radio-immunotherapy in a highly aggressive and immunologically &#8216;cold&#8217; oral cancer model.<br \/>Experimental Procedure: Studies were performed in the MOC2 syngeneic mouse model of oral cancer. Mice were randomized to one of seven treatment groups: &#945;PD1, Radiation (XRT), &#945;PD1+XRT, PLD, PLD+&#945;PD1, PLD+XRT, PLD+&#945;PD1+XRT. High-resolution nanoparticle contrast-enhanced computed tomography (nCECT) imaging was performed, and whole-body T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) used to monitor primary tumor response and development of metastases. Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) were used to evaluate treatment outcomes.<br \/>Results: Tumors in all non-PLD groups were treatment resistant and grew progressively, consistent with the immunologically &#8216;cold&#8217; MOC2 model. In contrast, all PLD groups showed tumor regression with 25-38% complete responders (CR) and 12-88% partial responders (PR) while all animals in non-PLD groups showed progressive disease (PD). MR imaging identified a high incidence of regional and distant metastases in the non-PLD groups while the PLD groups showed decreased regional and no distant metastases (Table1). Presence of metastases was confirmed by nCECT imaging and histopathological analysis.<br \/>Conclusion: PLD improved response to radio-immunotherapy in a highly aggressive immunologically &#8216;cold&#8217; mouse model of oral cancer while simultaneously preventing disease progression and metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oral cancers,Immunotherapy,Doxorubicin,Metastatic tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Laxman Devkota<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Rohan Bhavane<sup>2<\/sup>, Andrew Badachhape<sup>1<\/sup>, Ratna Veeramachaneni<sup>3<\/sup>, Renuka Menon<sup>1<\/sup>, Prajwal Bhandari<sup>1<\/sup>, Sofia Cortes<sup>3<\/sup>, Fabio Henrique Brasil Da Costa<sup>3<\/sup>, Ketan Ghaghada<sup>2<\/sup>, Simon Young<sup>4<\/sup>, Andrew  G.

Among the four E-type prostanoid receptors EP1-4, it has been demonstrated that PGE2 exhibits its immune suppression and tumorigenic function through engagement with EP2 and EP4. Mechanistically, tumor-derived PGE2 acts on EP2 and EP4 in immune cells (e.g., NK cells and dendritic cells) and elicits immunosuppression in TME<sup>1,2<\/sup>. Importantly, the deletion of both EP2 and EP4, but not deletion of either receptor, is required to reverse PGE2-mediated immune evasion. Furthermore, high levels of PGE2-EP2\/EP4 associated inflammatory signature have been shown in multiple human cancer types to correlate with poor prognosis and worse response to immune checkpoint blockade in the clinic<sup>1<\/sup>. Therefore, PGE2-EP2\/EP4 signaling likely acts as a key regulatory node linking inflammation and immunosuppression in TME, and its inhibition may lead to a less immunosuppressive TME and enhance the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. COX inhibitors have been used to block PGE2 synthesis but cause cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risks due to the inhibition of all prostanoids synthesis<sup>3<\/sup>. Thus, therapeutically targeting both EP2 and EP4 is an effective and more selective approach to limit the immunosuppressive functions of PGE2 while avoiding potential side effects associated with COX inhibition.<br \/>Here we describe the discovery of a potent and selective EP2\/EP4 dual antagonist DX-002. At 10 nM concentration, it displayed &#62;90% inhibition of PGE2 binding to EP2 or EP4, whereas no significant inhibition was seen towards PGE2 binding to EP1 or EP3. In human NK cells DX-002 reversed PGE2-mediated inhibition of IFN-&#947; production more potently than selective EP2 or EP4 antagonist. DX-002 has excellent pharmacokinetics profiles across all animal species. In the mouse tumor model, treatment of DX-002 produced superior tumor regression as a monotherapy over selective EP2 or EP4 antagonists. In addition, DX-002 also provided significant synergistical effect for tumor regression in combination with anti-PD1 in both immune checkpoint inhibitor insensitive and sensitive models, in association with increased tumor infiltration of CD8+ T cells. Based on its in vitro and in vivo profiles along with other properties, DX-002 is being profiled as a development candidate as a potential cancer immunotherapeutic agent.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Tumor microenvironment (TME),Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2),EP2 EP4,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lintong Li<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Guorui Yao<sup><\/sup>, Wei Zheng<sup><\/sup>, Yongshuai Chai<sup><\/sup>, Zhongying Huang<sup><\/sup>, Guojian Ma<sup><\/sup>, Linlin Nie<sup><\/sup>, Dengfeng Xu<sup><\/sup>, Jiuquan Yang<sup><\/sup>, Nanxin Li<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>GuangDong NewOpp Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"659abc5b-2502-4426-964a-e760875f6995","ControlNumber":"6872","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;L.

With Nrf2 activators under development and in clinical trials, it is critical to understand the influence of these drugs on cancer progression. While the anti-inflammatory nature of Nrf2 activation protects healthy cells from malignant transformation, cancer cells can utilize the pathway to promote resistance to anti-cancer drugs and increase tumor cell survival. Up to 30% of human lung adenocarcinomas acquire mutations in the Nrf2 pathway which result in constitutive activation. However, triterpenoids, including CDDO-methyl ester (CDDO-Me, also known as bardoxolone methyl), are potent pharmacological Nrf2 activators with demonstrated anti-cancer activity in preclinical models. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and macrophages are the most common immune cell type in the lung tumor microenvironment. To investigate Nrf2 activation in macrophages in the context of lung cancer, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were isolated from wild type (WT) and Nrf2 knock out (KO) mice and cultured in conditioned media from lung cancer cells to produce a tumor-educated phenotype. The triterpenoid CDDO-Me had anti-inflammatory effects in BMDMs stimulated with the conventional cytokines IFN-&#947; and LPS. Conversely, CDDO-Me increased (p &#60; 0.05) the M1 macrophage markers TNF&#945;, IL-6, and MHC-II and decreased the M2 macrophage markers VEGF, CCL2, and CD206 in tumor-educated BMDMs in a Nrf2-dependent manner. The phenotypic changes were observed on transcription, protein, and surface marker levels. This context-dependent reversal of BMDM polarization suggests that Nrf2 activation has different outcomes in different environments. To test CDDO-Me <i>in vivo<\/i>, lung tumors were initiated with vinyl carbamate in A\/J WT and Nrf2 KO mice, and animals were fed either control diet or CDDO-Me (12.5-50 mg\/kg of diet) for 16 weeks. CDDO-Me significantly (p &#60; 0.05) decreased tumor number, size, and overall burden and reduced the histopathological severity of tumors in a Nrf2- and dose-dependent manner. Additionally, CDDO-Me increased the infiltration of CD64+ macrophages but decreased CD206+ expression in macrophages in the lungs of WT tumor-bearing mice. Interestingly, CD206 expression was higher on macrophages in the spleen of WT mice treated with CDDO-Me, suggesting a cancer context dependency. Future studies will evaluate the dependency of Nrf2 activation in macrophages for the anti-tumor activity of CDDO-Me.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nrf2,NSCLC,Macrophages,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jess Ann Moerland<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Karen  T.

Major roles of CAFs in the immune microenvironment include deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) to prevent immune cell infiltration, a function associated with myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs), and production of cytokines to alter the immune milieu, associated with inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs). Recently we have demonstrated the potential for tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to alter CAF phenotypes. Here we investigate the ability of dasatinib and nilotinib to alter the immune regulatory functions of CAFs.<br \/>Methods: Bulk RNA sequencing comparing the effects of nilotinib and dasatinib on primary-derived patient CAFs was performed. CAFs from two rectal cancer patient tumors were isolated, cultured, and treated for 96 hours with 2.5&#956;M nilotinib, 100nM dasatinib, or control feeding media. RNA isolation, library preparation, sequencing, data processing, and differential expression analysis was done through the University of Wisconsin - Madison Gene Expression Center, Biotechnology Center, and Bioinformatics Resource. Gene set enrichment analyses were done using GSEA 4.2.3 (Broad Institute) and all other analyses done in R.<br \/>Results: The primary variance in samples is between CAF lines (RC1 and RC2), followed by treatments. RNA expression markers for myCAFs significantly associate with the Gene Ontology molecular function ECM structural constituent (q &#60; 0.001). Nilotinib decreased expression of this gene set in RC1 (q &#60; 0.001), while dasatinib treatment increased these genes in RC2, though not significantly (q = 0.2). Both dasatinib and nilotinib downregulated immune-related hallmark gene sets including IL6\/JAK\/STAT3 signaling (RC2 dasatinib q &#60; 0.05, q &#60; 0.001 for others) and TNF&#945; signaling through NF&#954;B (RC1 dasatinib q &#60; 0.001, RC2 niltoinib q &#60; 0.05, others q = 0.001,). Additionally, dasatinib induced increased expression of genes involved in myogenesis in both CAF lines (RC1 q = 0.001, RC2 q &#60; 0.001), while nilotinib significantly decreased these genes in RC1 (q = 0.001). MYOCD is a transcription factor involved in myogenesis that regulates important myCAF genes such as <i>ACTA2<\/i> and <i>TAGLN<\/i>. Nilotinib treatment decreased expression of <i>MYOCD <\/i>(RC1 log2FC -1.3 q &#60; 0.001, RC2 -0.75 q &#60; 0.05) and its target genes in both lines, whereas dasatinib did not significantly alter expression.<br \/>Conclusions: CAFs derived from different cancers harbor different transcriptional profiles and have different responses to TKIs. Dasatinib treatment led to an increase in expression of ECM genes associated with the myCAF phenotype, while nilotinib decreased this phenotype, potentially by inhibiting <i>MYOCD<\/i> expression. Further investigation into the mechanisms by which nilotinib treatment decreases expression of ECM genes and whether these trends continue <i>in vivo <\/i>are warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Katherine Anne Johnson<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Yousef Gadalla<sup><\/sup>, Cheri A.

By analyzing TCR repertoire of tumor and tumor-draining lymph node (dLN), we have demonstrated that Tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells can be classified into &#8220;dLN Major&#8221;, &#8220;Tumor Major&#8221;, and &#8220;Double Major&#8221; clones, which exhibited high frequency in the dLN, tumor, or both tissues. To investigate whether this classification was related to the tissue tropism in the proliferation of each clone, we here employed tumor-bearing Fucci transgenic mice expressing a fluorescent cell-cycle indicator to identify the proliferation of T-cell clones in each tissue. We purified proliferating- and resting-CD8+ T cells from the tumors and dLN and analyzed their TCR repertoire in an LLC subcutaneous tumor model. All Tumor Major clones were proliferated in the tumor, while nearly 0% for dLN Major, indicated their different proliferative capacity in the tumor. The percentage of proliferating clones in the dLN was 20% for Tumor Major and 15% for dLN Major, indicating that these clones had equivalent proliferative capacity in the dLN. These proliferating dLN major clones overlapped more with the tumor than the non-proliferating dLN major clones, suggesting that proliferating dLN Major clones had higher tumor migration capacity. Furthermore, these proliferating dLN major clones were more proliferative in the tumor. These results suggested that dLN Major responded to antigen presentation in the dLN but not in the tumor, whereas Tumor Major responded to those in the dLN and tumor. In addition, there are two types of dLN major, &#8220;clones that are proliferating in dLN&#8221; and &#8220;clones that are not proliferating in dLN&#8221; indicating that the former may contribute to the anti-tumor response. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment not only reactivates clones in the tumor but also activates tumor-reactive clones in the dLN. In conformity with these previous studies, the percentage of proliferating clones among dLN Major increased to about 50% and 80% in the dLN in mice with anti-PD-L1 and anti-CD4 treatment, respectively. This result suggests ICI treatment enhances anti-tumor responses mainly by promoting the activation and proliferation of dLN Major clones. This study shows new findings that tumor-reactive T cells differ in the tissue tropism of their proliferation of each clone. In the future, a quantitative understanding of the contribution of each class of clones to the anti-tumor response will hopefully lead to the development of new combined immunotherapies that optimize the anti-tumor T-cell response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Cancer immunotherapy,Immune response,Cell proliferation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mikiya Tsunoda<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hiroyasu Aoki<sup>1<\/sup>, Munetomo Takahashi<sup>2<\/sup>, Haruka Shimizu<sup>1<\/sup>, Haru Ogiwara<sup>1<\/sup>, Shigeyuki Shichino<sup>1<\/sup>, Kouji Matsushima<sup>1<\/sup>, Satoshi Ueha<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda-shi, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5c8e7841-3ac0-4341-9047-45e29708a898","ControlNumber":"3246","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a subset of tumor-infiltrating CD4 T cells express Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), a transmembrane protein that binds to multiple ligands with diverse functions in tumor and immune cells. Recent studies reveal that NRP1 can be induced upon T cell receptor stimulation and that NRP1 signaling promotes increased stabilization and function of CD4+ FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), while signaling on CD8 T cells results in inhibition of CD8 T cell migration and cytotoxicity; therefore, NRP1 is implicated as a newly defined immune checkpoint protein. The functional role of NRP1 in CD4+ FoxP3- T conventional cells (CD4 Tconv) and the ligands involved are largely unexplored. We have found that human lung cancer malignant pleural effusions (MPE) from a subset of metastatic lung cancer patients contain both NRP1+ and NRP1- CD4 Tconv cells, providing a relevant clinical setting to study the function of NRP1 in human T cells. Our preliminary studies reveal that MPE-derived NRP1+ CD4 Tconv cells have altered expression of CD25, suggestive of a more activated state as compared to that of NRP1- CD4 Tconv cells. Additionally, we have observed disproportionate cell death of NRP1+ CD4 Tconv cells that can be partially rescued with anti-NRP1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Surviving NRP1+ cells are more likely to express PD-1 and secrete effector cytokines. In our murine NSCLC model carrying key driver mutations <i>Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> P53<sup>-\/-<\/sup> Lkb1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> and higher tumor mutational burden (KPL-3M), analysis of tumor-infiltrating CD4 Tconv cells confirm that NRP1+ CD4 T cells are preferentially found within tumors and with higher PD-1 expression as compared to NRP1- cells. Furthermore, treatment with anti-NRP1 mAbs confers anti-tumor efficacy in this model, indicating that NRP1 is a functionally important inhibitor of host anti-tumor immune responses. These data suggest that CD4 Tconv cells expressing NRP1 are activated but prone to cell death, warranting further investigation into its potential as a therapeutic target for NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,T cell,Neuropilin-1,Immune checkpoint,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Bitta  P.

Thus, additional immunotherapies (IO) for NSCLC patients are needed. CD47 is an immunosuppressive protein frequently overexpressed in NSCLC. When bound to its receptor, SIRP&#945;, the phagocytic function of antigen presenting cells (APCs) is impaired which dampens the innate immune response and anti-tumor immunity. CD47-SIRP&#945;-targeted IOs are under investigation in clinical trials but little efficacy has been seen in solid tumours, suggesting further preclinical knowledge is needed to guide effective use in NSCLC. To address this need, we aim to decipher immune-mediated and cell-intrinsic mechanisms governing NSCLC response to CD47 inhibition.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: CRISPR\/Cas9 was used to generate mixed and clonal <i>Cd47<\/i> knockout (KO) populations in two murine, syngeneic NSCLC models (LLC and CMT167). The effect of <i>Cd47<\/i> inactivation on tumor cell fitness was assessed by multicolour competition assays conducted <i>in vitro<\/i> and in orthotopic tumors grown in immunocompetent C57BL\/6 mice. Survival studies were also done in immune competent (C57BL\/6) and deficient (NCG) mice to provide insights into cell-intrinsic versus immune-mediated effects of <i>Cd47<\/i> KO on tumor growth. Immunophenotyping of tumours grown in syngeneic hosts was done using flow cytometry to compare immune cell infiltration in wildtype (WT) versus <i>Cd47<\/i> KO tumors.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Multicolour competition assays revealed that <i>Cd47<\/i> LOF reduced the fitness of LLC and CMT167 cells grown in mice but not in cells grown <i>in vitro<\/i>, suggesting <i>Cd47<\/i> KO does not compromise cell proliferation. Consistent with these results, survival studies conducted in immune competent hosts showed prolonged survival of mice with <i>Cd47<\/i> KO compared to WT tumors in both models. An increase in activated Cd8+ cytotoxic T cells and M1-polarized macrophages was observed in <i>Cd47<\/i> KO tumors relative to WT controls. Interestingly, the same survival studies conducted in immune compromised mice also showed a significant survival benefit for mice with <i>Cd47<\/i> KO tumors, suggesting immune- and proliferation-independent, cell-intrinsic functions of <i>Cd47<\/i> may also regulate NSCLC growth and progression.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our results confirm the therapeutic potential of Cd47-targeted IO in NSCLC. The increased infiltration of anti-tumor lymphocytes and myeloid cells in <i>Cd47<\/i> KO tumours supports a role for the immune system in mediating enhanced survival. However, because immune deficient mice with <i>Cd47<\/i> KO tumors also exhibited a survival benefit, additional studies are required to deduce how <i>Cd47<\/i>-regulated cell-intrinsic mechanisms promote NSCLC biology.

We previously discovered an anti-PD-L1 peptide that can be potentially uses for lung cancer therapy. This project aims to develop an aerosolized formulation of the anti-PD-L1 peptide for the treatment of lung cancer. We hypothesize that the aerosolized peptide has higher accumulation in the lung compared to systematic formulations, leading to high therapeutic index with less side effects. We developed a spray freeze-drying procedure and optimized the formulation to prepare the peptide dry powders. The median mass aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) and geometric standard deviation (GSD) of the aerosols were determined by an 8-stage Andersen Cascade Impactor. The morphology of the aerosols was studied using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The stability of the aerosols in lung fluid was evaluated.

Its expression is dysregulated with an overexpression in tumors and a connection with tumors of adverse prognosis. We developed C57BL\/6 mouse models co-expressing human huBTLA and huHVEM as well as antagonistic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that completely prevent the interactions of HVEM with its ligands. Here, we show that the anti-HVEM18-10 mAb increases primary human &#945;&#946;-T cells activity alone (CIS-activity) or in the presence of HVEM-expressing lung or colorectal cancer cells <i>in vitro<\/i> (TRANS-activity). Anti-HVEM18-10 synergizes with anti-PD-L1 mAb to activate T cells in the presence of PDL-1 positive tumors, but is sufficient to trigger T cell activation in the presence of PD-L1 negative cells. In order to better understand HVEM18-10 effect <i>in vivo<\/i> and especially disentangle its CIS and TRANS effects, we developed a knock-in (KI) mouse model expressing human BTLA (huBTLA<sup>+\/+<\/sup>) and a KI mouse model expressing both human BTLA and human HVEM (huBTLA<sup>+\/+<\/sup> \/huHVEM<sup>+\/+ <\/sup>(DKI)). <i>In vivo<\/i> pre-clinical experiments performed in both mouse models showed that HVEM18-10 treatment was efficient to decrease human HVEM+ tumor growth.

Interestingly, mice which completely rejected tumors (&#177; 20%) did not develop tumors upon re-challenge in both settings, therefore showing a marked T cell-memory phenotype effect. Altogether, our preclinical models validate anti-HVEM18-10 as a promising therapeutic antibody to use in clinics as a monotherapy or in combination with existing immunotherapies (anti-PD1\/anti-PDL-1\/anti-CTLA-4).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,T lymphocytes,Mouse models,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Laurent GORVEL<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Clemence Demerle<sup>1<\/sup>, Marielle Mello<sup>2<\/sup>, Sonia Pastor<sup>1<\/sup>, Clara Degos<sup>1<\/sup>, Ana Zarubica<sup>2<\/sup>, Fabien Angelis<sup>2<\/sup>, Frederic Fiore<sup>2<\/sup>, Jacques Nunes<sup>1<\/sup>, Bernard Malissen<sup>2<\/sup>, Laurent Greillier<sup>3<\/sup>, Geoffrey Guittard<sup>1<\/sup>, Herve Luche<sup>2<\/sup>, Fabrice Barlesi<sup>4<\/sup>, Daniel Olive<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Centre de Recherche en Cancérologie de Marseille (CRCM), Marseille, France,<sup>2<\/sup>Centre d'Immunophénomique - CIPHE (PHENOMIN), Marseille, France,<sup>3<\/sup>Aix Marseille University, APHM, INSERM, CNRS, CRCM, Hôpital Nord,, Marseille, France,<sup>4<\/sup>Multidisciplinary Oncology and Therapeutic Innovations, Aix Marseille University, CNRS, INSERM; Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Marseille, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d3e91de9-162f-45af-a62b-f02d16b64ce9","ControlNumber":"3545","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

In preclinical studies, the presence of lung intratumoral <i>Escherichia <\/i>was associated with a proinflammatory tumor microenvironment and decreased metastases within lung tissue. We sought to detect intratumoral bacteria in pts with advanced NSCLC using hybrid capture-based, next generation sequencing (NGS). We studied 849 pts treated with ICI-based therapy who underwent NGS at our center. We extracted unmapped reads from BAM files, and these were queried for bacteria (blastn alignment using the NCBI database). Putative environmental contaminants were subtracted from the analysis using &#8220;no template&#8221; controls (n=2,539) to exclude possible artifactual false positives. A custom <i>E.Coli <\/i>fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe was used to visualize <i>Escherichia<\/i> within the tumors after co-registration with H&#38;E. In 849 pts, a median of 30 bacterial reads was detected per sample (inter-quartile range (18-85)). Among 68 pts with paired primary\/metastatic samples, the bacterial spectra were similar in both sites, suggesting that tumor resident bacteria might travel with cancer cells to distant sites. Antibiotic use within 30 days of tumor sampling was associated with decreased intratumoral bacterial diversity (p=0.023 by Inverse Simpson, p=0.038 by Shannon). Intratumoral <i>Escherichia<\/i> was associated with better PFS (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62-0.98, p=0.036), and OS (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58-0.95, p=0.017) in pts treated with single-agent ICI, but not combination Chemo\/ICI. In a multivariable model adjusting for prognostic features in NSCLC including PD-L1 tumor proportion score, the presence of intratumoral <i>Escherichia<\/i> was associated with better PFS (p=0.040) and OS (p=0.045) upon single-agent ICI therapy. <i>Escherichia<\/i> appeared to be intracellular based on co-registration of FISH staining and serial H&#38;E sections. These findings warrant further investigation of the possible inter-relationships between intratumoral <i>Escherichia<\/i>, tumor immune micro-environment, and ICI therapeutic outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-07 Microbiome,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Arielle Elkrief<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Anita S.
