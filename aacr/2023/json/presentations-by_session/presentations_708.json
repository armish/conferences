[{"Abstract":"Antitumor peptide vaccine is an alternative and attractive way to eradicate tumors by the aid of host immune system. The current peptide vaccine development is hampered by several hurdles. These include heterogeneity of tumor cells, applicable in vivo stability of peptides, and others. One of the major obstacles is the precise prediction of cancer antigen, which can be loaded efficiently onto antigen presenting cells. We present here a neoantigen prediction algorithm DeepNeo comprised of DeepNeo-MHC and DeepNeo-TCR, which calculates the antigenicity of neoantigen based on the MHC binding and TCR activation potential. We examined the efficacy of DeepNeo using ELISPOT and two allogenic mouse tumor models. By treating the combination of long peptides targeting MC38 colon or B16F10 melanoma cell lines, we have shown the DeepNeo effectively determines neoantigens for the development of antitumor peptide vaccine. Analysis of tumor-infiltrated lymphocytes (TIL) supported our results. Undergoing study using patient-derived xenograft model treated with autologous, trained PBMC with personalized peptide vaccine will be discussed further.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer vaccine,Peptides,Machine learning,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Eun Ji Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Ji Park<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Soo Jin Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seung-Jae Noh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Inkyung Shin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeong Yeon Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Incheol Shin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jung Kyoon Choi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dae-Yeon Cho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Suhwan Chang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

The poor survival rate of GBM is often attributed to the low therapeutic efficiency of current front-line therapy, treatment resistance, and high recurrence rate. Sizeable clinical data of cancer patients preserve a great potential for drug discovery and drug repurposing research, enabling comprehensive screening of treatment effects among frequently-prescribed medications. To efficiently characterize potent drug candidates and develop novel treatment strategies for GBM, we designed a machine-learning-based pipeline that predicts repurposable drug combinations from large-scale patient claims data. Our pipeline first identified pseudo-randomized drug-user and non-user cohorts from heterogeneous clinical records and balanced the confounding effects using the Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) method. Next, our model computed the averaged treatment effect on the treated (ATT) values to determine the treatment effects of our candidates. Our methodology identified several promising drug combinations that have been found to be effective in inhibiting GBM in cell line experiments. This research was conducted by integrating computational and experimental approaches to identify drug combinations, providing a promising strategy for the development of new treatments for GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Drug discovery,Glioblastoma multiforme,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ko-Hong Lin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yejin Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dung-Fang Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoqian Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>.

MEs are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Tropism of tumor cells in these spaces is poorly understood and tumor cells residing in these fluids are difficult to study with traditional methods due to low abundance. To overcome this limitation and understand the pathobiology of MEs in MBCs, we applied a label-free method to isolate tumor cells based on morphology using an artificial intelligence (AI) model This method enabled isolation of live cells for downstream molecular analysis and characterization of morphological heterogeneity.<br \/>We collected ME samples from 9 MBC patients with cytology-confirmed MEs, including 3 triple negative and 6 hormone receptor-positive\/HER2-negative breast cancers. ME cells were imaged and isolated using a Deepcell AI model trained on a separate cohort of MEs to isolate and enrich tumor cells based on deep learning representations of morphological features. Quantitative morphological features were then extracted from cell images to perform cluster analysis and visualized by dimensionality reduction projections. In parallel, flow cytometry (FC) was used to quantify % EpCAM+\/Claudin4+ tumor cells in ME samples. Copy number (CN) analysis was performed before and after enrichment with as few as 200 cells from each sample. Tumor cell fraction (TCF) estimates were calculated from the AI classifier, FC, and CN analyses.<br \/>CN profiling of malignant cells sorted by the AI classifier revealed genomic alterations common in breast cancer in 7 of 9 patients. We observed increased amplitude of genomic alterations in tumor-enriched vs. unenriched samples, indicating successful tumor cell enrichment in 14 out of 16 samples. We observed a significant correlation in TCF between the AI classifier and FC with a Spearman test (rho=0.568, p0.008). In some cases, the AI classifier reported higher TCF than FC. This could indicate that the AI model detected tumor cells missed by antibody labeling or false positives from morphologically similar cell types, such as macrophages and mesothelial cells. Remarkably, analysis of serial ME samples from the same patient revealed morphological shifts in cell populations which were consistent with changes in TCF by CN analysis.<br \/>We demonstrate the feasibility of label-free identification and isolation of tumor cells in MEs using an AI classifier. CN profiling of isolated tumor cells verified enrichment from low initial frequencies. Future work will include expression analysis of ME tumor and immune cells, and analysis of organoids derived from MEs. Combining molecular and morphological profiling of MEs will enable new insights into their pathobiology and inform targeted treatment strategies for patients with this condition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,artificial intelligence,morphology,malignant effusions,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Mark J.

While recent analyses indicated <i>TP53 <\/i>mutations as candidate biomarker, molecular profiling in a clinical setting is complicated by tumor heterogeneity. Deep learning models that predict the spatial presence of <i>TP53 <\/i>mutations in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) offer the potential to mitigate this issue. To assess the potential of WSIs as proxy for spatially resolved profiling or as biomarker for aggressive disease, we developed <i>TiDo<\/i>, a deep learning model that achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting <i>TP53 <\/i>mutations from WSIs of primary prostate tumors. On an independent multi-focal cohort, we could show successful generalization of the model, both at patient and lesion level. Hence, the model offers insight into which lesions on a WSI most likely contain a <i>TP53 <\/i>mutation.<br \/>Analysis of model predictions revealed that false positive (FP) predictions could at least partially be explained by <i>TP53 <\/i>deletions. This suggests that some FP carry another alteration of which the effect converges in the same histological phenotype. Comparative expression analysis and histological cell type analysis identified such common phenotype (related to stromal composition) in both TP and FP predictions. This indicates that WSI-based models might not be able to perfectly predict the spatial presence of individual <i>TP53 <\/i>mutations. However, we show they have the potential of capturing a tumor&#8217;s aggressive potential by observing a downstream phenotype of the tumor cells and TME associated with a biomarker of aggressive disease (<i>TP53<\/i>).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Deep learning,Tumor heterogeneity,Prognostic factors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marija Pizurica<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maarten Larmuseau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kim Van der Eecken<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Louise De Schaetzen van Brienen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francisco Carrillo-Perez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simon Isphording<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolaas Lumen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jo Van Dorpe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Piet Ost<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sofie Verbeke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olivier Gevaert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kathleen Marchal<\/i><\/presenter>.

This potential could be greatly improved by combining information about receptor clonotypes with immunophenotypes of T- and B- cells. A new technology we developed that combines profiling of all human TCR and BCR variable regions with phenotypic characterization of immune cells using the same workflow could be particularly useful. The TCR and BCR immunophenotyping method proposed involves RT-PCR amplification and sequencing of the CDR3 regions of the TCR and BCR genes, and subsequently determining the expression levels of the most informative T- and B-cell phenotyping genes. Preliminary results show that this method allows for comprehensive profiling of all seven TCR and BCR chains from a single sample, in a highly reproducible manner, directly from micro-samples including cancer tissue, whole blood, sorted cells and more. Bioinformatic analysis of the next-generation sequencing (NGS) data from the TCR and BCR clonotypes profile combined with RNA expression profiling of the same samples results in a richer data set that includes the identification of major immune cell subtypes and their activation status.

Evidence is starting to emerge that blockade of more than one galectin may provide additional benefit within the oncology arena due to the overlapping biological functions associated with these lectins. Due to the rich and robust external datasets associated with the two most previously studied galectins, we initially investigated the potential therapeutic benefit of a dual blockade approach of Galectin-1 (Gal-1) and Galectin-3 (Gal-3). A systematic assessment, consisting of three steps, was implemented to conclude the potential clinical effects of dual Gal-1 and Gal-3 inhibition and the specific cancers which may benefit the most from this approach. Step 1 consisted of pathway map reconstructions, depicting the role of Gal-1 and Gal-3 in tumor invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis, to confirm overlapping and independent cancer pathways associated with both galectins. These maps were constructed based on evidence from published literature and additional external databases. Step 2 aligned and ranked the associated expression of Gal-1 and Gal-3 at both the mRNA and protein level across different cancer types. This profiling included data from publicly available TCGA and CPTAC databases and additional external sources. Step 3 tested the highest ranked Gal-1 and Gal-3 mRNA and protein expressing cancers for association of survival by stratifying patients into four cohorts: Gal-1 low\/Gal-3 low, Gal-1 high\/Gal-3 low, Gal-1 low\/Gal-3 high, Gal-1 high\/Gal-3 high. Survival profiles quite clearly show that high expression of both galectins leads to poor survival in certain cancer types but not all. To summarize, using a bioinformatics approach, we have provided the initial evidence that Gal-1 and Gal-3 are highly expressed at both the gene and protein level in several cancers with their combined expression strongly correlating with poor survival rates. This data suggests, in certain cancer types, that targeting dual inhibition of Gal-1 and Gal-3 will have the potential to improve patient survival to a greater extent than a single Galectin blockade approach.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-04 Integration of clinical and research data,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Galectin-3,Galectin-1,Survival,Expression profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ian Holyer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rob Slack<\/i><\/presenter>.

In breast cancer, it decreases patient survival. Diabetes also impacts African American women more so than European American women, potentially contributing to the breast cancer health disparity. In this study, we investigated the influence of diabetes on breast cancer biology in a diverse patient cohort using a three-pronged approach that included analysis of orthotopic human tumor xenografts, patient tumors, and breast cancer cells exposed to diabetes\/hyperglycemia-like conditions. We aimed to identify shared phenotypes and molecular signatures by investigating the metabolome, transcriptome, and tumor mutational burden. Diabetes does not enhance cell proliferation but induces mesenchymal and stem cell-like phenotypes linked to increased mobility and odds of metastasis. It also promotes oxyradical formation and both transcriptome and mutational signatures of DNA repair deficiency. Moreover, food- and microbiome-derived metabolites tend to accumulate in breast tumors in presence of diabetes, potentially affecting tumor biology. Breast cancer cells cultured under hyperglycemia-like conditions acquire increased DNA damage and sensitivity to DNA repair inhibitors. Based on these observations, diabetes-associated breast tumors may show an increased drug response to DNA damage repair inhibitors that are cancer therapeutics.<br \/>Key words: Breast cancer, diabetes, metabolome, transcriptome, metastasis, DNA repair, mutational signature, health disparity","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-05 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Diabetes,metabolome,transcriptome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gatikrushna Panigrahi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julián Candia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tiffany H.

Upon stress, PGCCs adopt an endoreplication in which the genome replicates, mitosis is omitted, and cells grow in size, leading to resistance. How accessible endoreplication is to a cell, therefore, directly translates to its resistance to therapy. In this study, we hypothesized that endoreplication and PGCC state are more plausible to cancer cells that already have a higher ploidy content prior to therapy. To test this hypothesis, we developed a comprehensive three-tier framework consisting of i) computational, ii) <i>in vitro<\/i> and iii) <i>in silico<\/i> components.<br \/>We designed a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to model how cells enter and exit the PGCC state in response to a given stressor. We engineered how this <i>in silico<\/i> approach interacts with <i>in vitro<\/i> experiments into a broadly applicable software solution called CLONEID. The software uses computer vision to monitor phenotypic changes in cell and nuclear size from standard bright-field microscopy and classify cells into PGCC and non-PGCC states. We used CLONEID to test various therapeutic agents for their ability to select for a stable near-tetraploid population in a set of near-diploid cell lines. Through spontaneous cell fusions, we also obtained tetraploid breast cancer cells matched with their parental lines. Altogether, this framework, now, enables us i) to monitor the PGCC state experimentally ii) in matched cell lines with differential DNA content iii) to model the successful entrance and exit rates to and from the endoreplication state, respectively.<br \/>As the first application of this framework, we tested the ability of our matched triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) lines (SUM-159 and MDA-MB-231) to access the PGCC state upon treatment with 18 commonly-used chemotherapy agents. We observed that gemcitabine caused continued cell growth without cell division in both tetraploid SUM-159 and MDA-MB-231 cells whereas near-diploid parental cells were hypersensitive to the treatment. Consequently, tetraploid cancer cells continued to safely grow in the presence of gemcitabine. Furthermore, these PGCCs re-entered the proliferative cell cycle and grew in cell number when treatment is terminated.<br \/>Gemcitabine (GEM)-based chemotherapy is a standard treatment for patients with TNBC although its efficacy is limited mainly due to drug resistance. Moreover, such poor response rate is coupled with severe side effects that frequently leads to the failure of vital organs, serious secondary diseases, and co-morbidities. Our findings suggest that ploidy is a predictive biomarker for gemcitabine sensitivity. Thus, we expect our findings and three-component framework strategy to help stratify the TNBC patient population by their response to gemcitabine. In addition, our mathematical modelling approach has the promising potential to inform personalized dose optimization and to effectively decrease administered gemcitabine dose for a subset of patients, which would alleviate therapy-associated side effects and lethalities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-05 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Modeling,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Aneuploidy,Gemcitabine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Vural Tagal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jackson P.

However, many patients do not develop durable responses to ICI treatments and the underlying mechanisms of action are not fully resolved. Recent single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) studies provide a window into the complex interplay between cancer and heterogenous immune cell populations underlying ICI response. However, individual studies are typically focused on specific therapies in specific cancer types making it challenging to identify universal mechanisms and response markers.<br \/>Approach: To facilitate a more comprehensive study of cell-type specific ICI mechanisms and response determinants, we developed the Single Cell Immune Checkpoint Inhibition Atlas (ICI Atlas) which integrates 27 scRNA-seq datasets (including 17 human and 10 mice datasets) spanning close to 1.9 million cells. Of the 27 datasets, 25 contain both pre- and post-treatment samples, one contains only pre-treatment samples and one contains only post-treatment samples. The Atlas spans over 30 cell types and 16 different cancer types as well as 20 treatment strategies spanning 11 ICI therapies and 28 other drugs.<br \/>Results: To begin exploring the cell-type specific responses to ICI, we conducted comparative analyses of the ICI Atlas T cells in 4 groups: 1) responders vs. non-responders pre-treatment; 2) responders vs. non-responders post-treatment; 3) responders post-treatment vs. untreated; and 4) non-responders post-treatment vs. untreated leading to 62 pairwise comparisons across ICI Atlas datasets and treatment strategies. First, we found that T cells were either more abundant or more differentiated after ICI treatment and were more differentiated or more abundant in responders (post-treatment) compared to non-responders. We also found that genes previously identified in a meta-analysis of bulk mRNA datasets (Litchfield et al. 2021) as being effective predictors of ICI response are also more highly expressed in T cells of responders post-treatment compared to non-responders or compared to untreated subjects. Using an IFN-related gene signature, we found that post treatment as compared to baseline, IFN genes increased more substantially in responders than in non-responders. Across a large set of studies, we found that the IFN signature clusters T cells into IFN-effector\/producers (effector\/activated T cells) and IFN-insensitive cells (naive\/memory T cells). Finally, using Atlas-derived ICI response signatures in T cells and data from a recently published study of mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancers (MMRd CRC, Pelka et al. 2021), we showed that T cells from MMRd CRC patients recapitulate signatures of ICI responders. Our results suggest that large-scale scRNA-seq atlases can serve as valuable tools for corroborating existing hypotheses, as well as providing key new insights into cell-type specific mechanisms underlying ICI therapy response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-05 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Single cell,Biomarkers,Databases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Piotr Topolewski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aleksandra Mo&#380;wi&#322;&#322;o<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marlena Osipowicz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roy Ronen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Janusz Dutkowski<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

The distinct functional mechanisms underlying this &#8220;sidedness&#8221; remain cryptic and poorly understood. Thus, molecular classification of CRC is of paramount in targeting specific subtypes and personalizing treatment for patients. To identify targetable molecular features to improve treatment regimens, we performed multi-faceted network analyses of hundreds of CRC patients. In our network model, epigenetic features, differential expression of transcript abundance, and mutational frequency were used to identify widespread gene dysregulation and perturbed pathways to reveal disrupted networks distinct to right or left sided colorectal cancer. We discovered histone related genes and distinct epigenetic signals are at play in right-sided CRC. Additionally, our studies reveal &#8220;at risk&#8221; patient characteristics suggestive of survival differences, to improve diagnostic predictors based on CRC sidedness. Overall, our integrative approach serves to link molecular profiles distinct between left and right sided colorectal cancer, while improving upon previous models of CRC and paving the way towards identifying more effective treatment alternatives from a previously overlooked, readily characterized subtype of colorectal cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-05 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Systems biology,Epigenomics,Gene regulation,Survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Brandon Burgman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xingxin Pan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>S.

Single-cell multi-omics analysis of CTCs can provide critical information and insights for tumor heterogeneity, early detection, residual disease, recurrence, and response and resistance to therapies. However, the adoption of single cell analysis in a clinical setting has been challenging due to complicated and lengthy workflows, lack of automation, low throughput, cell loss, inefficient cell picking, and nucleic acid degradation. To overcome these challenges, we have developed the fully automated LiquidScan liquid biopsy platform as a solution for CTC enrichment and single cell isolation. Whole blood samples were collected from breast, prostate, and lung cancer patients using BioFluidica blood collection tubes. CTCs were enriched with LiquidScan platform coupled with microfluidic affinity selection of rare cells with antibodies against cancer specific surface markers. Cell eluates released from microfluidic chips were further sorted and individual cells were placed into individual wells of PCR plates. The isolated single cells were processed with either whole genome amplification for DNA analysis or pre-amplification of RNA for transcriptome profiling. Cell viability and RNA integrity were assessed for enriched cells post LiquidScan processing. Whole blood samples were directly loaded to microfluidic chips and processed (capture, wash, release and elute) using Hamilton robot for automated processing with no require to red blood cell lysis. The sample processing time was approximately 3 hours with up to 8 samples processed simultaneously. Enriched cells were 70% viable on average post LiquidScan sample processing. The RNA RIN score for the enriched cells was 6 on average.

Mutated, alternately spliced, over-expressed, mis-folded and abnormally post-translationally modified proteins may elicit immune responses that suppress tumor development. As these cancer specific proteins are distinct from normal self-proteins they offer the possibility of serving as highly-specific cancer biomarkers for early detection. TAAs are increasingly being targeted for priming the immune response to immunotherapies and cancer vaccines. Consequently, there has been an exponential increase in research on neo-antigen profiling using sequencing and multi-omic technologies. However, proteomic tools capable of studying and profiling the cancer proteome are limited. To contribute to this, we are developing a novel proteomic screening platform termed Sensor-integrated Proteome on Chip (SPOC) that enables high-throughput (HTP) screening of cancer proteins for loss or gain of function analysis, and humoral immune response profiling. SPOC platform enables use of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensing for kinetic interaction profiling of 100s to 1000s of proteins at once, which can be applied to discovery and characterization of autoantibodies and neoantigens. SPOC uses human cell-free in vitro transcription and translation to express fusion capture-tagged proteins of interest from DNA plasmids printed in nanowells etched into a silicon slide. As proteins are expressed, they are captured covalently onto an overlaid gold-coated surface in individual spots via the capture ligand. The capture ligand requires the tag to be properly folded for binding, thus proteins on the surface are presumed to be fully folded when captured. When SPOC chips are analyzed using SPR, kinetic measurements of protein interactions can be obtained for each protein spot over time (RMax, Kon, Koff, etc.). SPOC arrays may be probed with a variety of biological molecules including small molecule drugs, antibodies, and other proteins. Data can be analyzed using bioinformatics and machine learning for neo-antigen discovery and to generate distinct signatures of disease. To demonstrate SPOC utility for neo-antigen discovery and characterization, a serum sample with known anti-p53 autoantibodies was analyzed on a SPOC SPR chip containing expressed p53 protein spots distributed throughout the array. Increases in SPR signals were observed for each p53 spot on the array as anticipated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-06 Liquid biopsy: Multi-analyte and multi-omic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Cancer diagnostics,Protein-protein interactions,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rebecca Cook<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chidozie Victor Agu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William Martelly<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter A.

However, observational datasets are commonly affected by confounding factors making causal interpretation challenging. Causal inference network methods are particularly suited to facilitate therapeutic intervention studies by inferring the causal structure from sufficiently detailed multi-omic molecular data. The learned models enable <i>in-silico<\/i> loss-of-function screening experiments on patient data by using counterfactual simulation to reveal the impact of a gene loss in a disease model. These models enhance gene dependency characterization and the design of advanced therapeutic interventions.<br \/>In this study, we developed an <i>in-silico<\/i> multiple myeloma (MM) patient causal model of overall survival (OS) based on transcriptomic expression, clinical, and genomic alteration data from Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) CoMMpass dataset (IA19). After filtering for data quality and availability, we included 516 patients, with 60% being hyperdiploid. We sampled Bayesian networks using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation to infer probabilistic causal relationships between network components that influence overall survival. We then simulated synthetic knock downs of those genes where a path exists to overall survival with posterior probability of at least 0.25. Next, we compared CRISPR-SpCas9 cancer dependency data from DepMap (version 22Q2) for multiple myeloma cell lines against genes predicted to be causal (causal genes) for overall survival. Last, we examined the causal genes that are non-dependent in MM cell lines for upstream genomic alterations to determine if specific patient genomic contexts are affecting the results.<br \/>We identified 102 causal genes, including non-coding RNA genes (n=23), driving overall survival. Among them, 70% (56\/79, p=2.2e-16, OR=9.5) of the coding genes were found to be MM-dependent in DepMap, with 44 common essential, 7 strongly selective and 5 weakly selective genes. From 23 genes identified as causal and not known to be MM-dependent, 20 (87%) were selective in other cancer lineages and all of them (23\/23) had consistent upstream genomic alterations driving their expression.<br \/>Causal genes identified from AI-driven <i>in-silico<\/i> experiments to predict overall survival were strongly enriched for known dependent genes from DepMap. Furthermore, we identified causal genes that may be dependent in unique patient genomic contexts. This demonstrates <i>in-silico<\/i> AI causal modelling is a powerful tool for exploring cancer cell vulnerability directly from patient data to advance target discovery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-08 Network biology and precision medicine,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Multiple myeloma,Machine learning,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Brandon Nathasingh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Derek Walkama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laurel Mayhew<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kendall Loh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeanne Latourelle<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bruce W.

However, to date PARP inhibitors have demonstrated only modest clinical success as monotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer. In addition, conventional therapies are often coupled with severe toxicity. Therefore, there is a dire need to develop more effective combination therapies. Although there are many existing tools to predict possible actionable targets, it remains challenging to effectively and systematically identify drug combinations for better breast cancer therapeutics. This is because most tumors carry multiple genetic alterations that cannot be suppressed with mono-therapies; and diverse confounding factors such as intra-tumor and inter-tumor heterogeneity exist across patient populations. Our preliminary proteomics study has revealed a new protein mark called arginine methylation as a novel target for breast cancer. We found that inhibition of arginine methylation can sensitize cancer cells for PARP inhibition treatment. We further assessed and validated this actionable and synergistic drug combination in patient-derived xenograft models. Together, our novel target combinations discovered here may serve as important biomarkers to help develop more effective combination therapy. Furthermore, our results help uncover patient-specific signaling mechanisms, a critical step towards precision medicine in breast cancer therapy, which is a benefit and <u>potential long-term outcome<\/u>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-08 Network biology and precision medicine,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Post-transcriptional regulation,Precision medicine,Breast cancer,DNA repair,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yang Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel J.

Here, we systematically analyzed the human essentialome from a network perspective. We found that essential genes are mostly context-specific and predicted synthetic lethal interactions based on analysis of context-specific essentiality in distinct genetic backgrounds. The predicted gene pairs are significantly overlapped with known synthetic lethality and further validated across more than 300 cancer cell lines. Moreover, analysis of synthetic lethal interactions among actionable genes helps prioritizing rational drug combinations. Surprisingly, genes in human essentialome (especially spliceosome, RNA transport and cell cycle genes) are enriched for cancer mutations with high functional impact and disease risks. Our network analyses suggest that protein interactome topology and neighborhood community integrated with gene expression, are highly predictive of gene essentiality. Thus, we devised network-based method (SYE-NET) to systematically prioritize the essentialome, which is further validated by functional screens in independent cell lines. Taken together, our study provides a holistic insight into molecular determinants for cell fate and implicates potential biomarkers for synthetic lethality and drug combinations in cancer, a critical step towards precision medicine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-08 Network biology and precision medicine,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,Synthetic lethality,Systems biology,Genetic susceptibility,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yongsheng Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nidhi Sahni<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>S.
