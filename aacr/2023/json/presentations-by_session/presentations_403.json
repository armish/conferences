[{"Abstract":"The Hippo signaling pathway is critical for the regulation of organ development, tissue homeostasis, and tumorigenesis by controlling the activation status of yes-associated protein (YAP) or its homolog PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). As a major downstream effector, the transcription factor TEAD is activated by forming a complex with YAP\/TAZ. Hippo pathway aberrations, such as NF2-deficiency or LATS1\/2 mutations leading to hyperactivation of YAP\/TAZ and subsequent activation of TEAD, have been reported in many cancers, including mesothelioma, meningioma, soft tissue sarcoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Inhibiting TEAD auto-palmitoylation by directly blocking the palmitoylation pocket of TEAD is a potential therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. Here we present BPI-460372, a novel small molecule that directly blocks the TEAD auto-palmitoylation. BPI-460372 covalently and irreversibly binds to the cysteine residue in the TEAD palmitoylation pocket, preventing TEAD palmitoylation and inhibiting its biological function. BPI-460372 significantly inhibits the expression of a TEAD-responsive element reporter, as well as the mRNA of downstream target genes such as CTGF and CYR61 in NF2-deficient cells. At the cellular level, BPI-460372 strongly inhibited the proliferation of tumor cells harboring Hippo pathway aberrations. BPI-460372 also significantly suppressed tumor growth in NF2-deficient or LATS1\/2 mutation xenograft models. In addition, BPI-460372 exhibited excellent oral bioavailability, high exposure across multiple species, and adequate ADME properties. In conclusion, BPI-460372 is a potent and selective TEAD palmitoylation inhibitor for the treatment of solid tumors harboring Hippo pathway aberrations. It is planned to enter Phase I clinical trial in China in early 2023.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Hippo pathway,YAP\/TAZ,NSCLC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Hongling Shen<sup><\/sup>, Xiaofeng Xu<sup><\/sup>, Hongfei Rong<sup><\/sup>, Xizhen Song<sup><\/sup>, Jinheng Gao<sup><\/sup>, Jie Chen<sup><\/sup>, Di Zhu<sup><\/sup>, Xiangdong Zhao<sup><\/sup>, Jun Tong<sup><\/sup>, Zhengyao Zou<sup><\/sup>, Xiaoyun Liu<sup><\/sup>, Jin Guo<sup><\/sup>, Yan Xu<sup><\/sup>, Yabin Li<sup><\/sup>, Xiangyong Liu<sup><\/sup>, Hong Chen<sup><\/sup>, Jiayu Zhao<sup><\/sup>, Yanju Liu<sup><\/sup>, Xuepeng Ju<sup><\/sup>, Haibo Chen<sup><\/sup>, Hong Lan<sup><\/sup>, Lieming Ding<sup><\/sup>, <b>Jiabing Wang<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Betta Pharmaceuticals Co.,Ltd, Hangzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a85f1ee0-2462-4e47-87f7-e22de376a65d","ControlNumber":"3290","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

USP-1 expression is dysregulated in many cancers where it acts as an oncogenic driver with roles in various DNA damage repair processes including translesion synthesis and the Fanconi anemia pathway. Previous data show that USP1 plays a critical role in protecting the replication fork in BRCA1-deficient cells and that its loss results in reduced cell survival and replication fork degradation, suggesting that USP1 inhibitors may be particularly useful in BRCA-deficient tumors. Though PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have shown clinical benefit in BRCA-mutated (BRCAm) populations, some patients either do not respond to therapy or develop resistance. USP1 inhibitors may have the potential to address this unmet clinical need. We evaluated ISM3091, a novel and selective USP1 inhibitor, against tumor cell lines and <i>in vivo<\/i> models with BRCAm and other homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD), as well as in homologous recombination (HR)-proficient models.ISM3091 demonstrated potent anti-proliferation activity (IC<sub>50<\/sub>, 20 nM) in the BRCA1m triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line, MDA-MB-436, with a ~1500-fold selectivity for BRCAm vs BRCA WT. Synthetic lethality between USP1 and HRD was due to persistent monoubiquitinated PCNA. <i>In vitro<\/i> data revealed that the combination of ISM3091 and olaparib, a PARPi, had synergistic activity in cell lines with HRD. Multiple <i>in vivo<\/i> CDX and PDX models confirmed the dose-dependent, single-agent inhibitory activity of ISM3091, with Tumor Growth Inhibition (TGI) of 66% at 30 mg\/kg BID (TNBC) and 60% at 50 mg\/kg BID (ovarian). The combination of ISM3091 and olaparib yielded a more robust and durable anti-tumor response, even at low doses of ISM3091, with TGI of 91% (TNBC; ISM3091, 3 mg\/kg BID + olaparib, 50 mg\/kg QD) and 110% (ovarian; ISM3091, 50 mg\/kg BID + olaparib, 50 mg\/kg QD). Notably, ISM3091 displayed strong single-agent activity (TGI 72% at 50 mg\/kg BID) in an ovarian PDX model with acquired resistance to olaparib (BRCA WT), indicating that it has the potential to treat tumors with HRD beyond BRCAm, and also to overcome PARPi resistance. <i>In vivo<\/i> evaluation against the HR-proficient lung adenocarcinoma cell line, NCIH1792, showed potent efficacy (TGI 86% at 30 mg\/kg BID) suggesting a broader ISM3091 potential. ISM3091also displayed very favorable ADME properties<br \/>and PK profiles, and GLP toxicology studies indicated that it was well tolerated without significant gastrointestinal toxicity or hematological toxicity. These data support the future clinical development of ISM3091 as a potential best-in-class USP1 inhibitor not only for PARPi-resistant\/responsive HRD-mutant cancers, both, as a single agent as well as in combination with PARPi, but also for subsets of HR-proficient cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ubiquitination,DNA damage response,Drug resistance,Synthetic lethality,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yangguang Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Jianping Wu<sup>1<\/sup>, Jinxin Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Luoheng Qin<sup>1<\/sup>, Xin Cai<sup>1<\/sup>, Junwen Qiao<sup>1<\/sup>, Ling Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Sujata Rao<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, Feng Ren<sup>1<\/sup>, Alex Zhavoronkov<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Insilico Medicine, Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Insilico Medicine, New York, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f9086b22-75ff-4c53-a7bb-d5ae3837e6f5","ControlNumber":"3273","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;Y.

Despite broad cellular functions, MAT2A was recently implicated as a synthetic lethal target in cancers that have a deletion of the methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) gene, which is found in approximately 15% of all cancers. Here, we report ISM3412 is a novel potent MAT2A inhibitor with high selectivity.<br \/>In enzymatic assays, ISM3412 demonstrated a strong inhibition of MAT2A with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 19.4 nM. In both HCT116 MTAP-\/- cells and HCT116 parental cells, the compound inhibited SAM production, with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 5.97 nM and 3.66 nM, respectively. Additionally, it inhibited SDMA production in HCT116 MTAP-\/- cells (IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 6.37 nM), but not in HCT116 parental cells (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#62; 2000 nM). Consistent with the large SDMA inhibitory potency difference between the HCT116 isogenic cell pair, ISM3412 also exhibited very good selectivity in cellular proliferation assays. While it inhibited cellular growth in HCT116 MTAP-\/-cells with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 199nM, its inhibitory potency on HCT116 parental cells was very weak (IC<sub>50<\/sub> of &#62;21117nM), revealing more than a 100-fold selectivity in inhibiting growth in this isogenic pair cell line. Furthermore, while ISM3412 strongly inhibited proliferation in multiple cancer cell lines with natural MTAP deficiency (including pancreatic cancer, bladder cancer, and NSCLC), the same was not observed in multiple MTAP-intact cell lines (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#62; 30 uM).<br \/>Consistent with the <i>in vitro<\/i> data, ISM3412 demonstrated robust mono-therapeutic efficacy in an MTAP-\/- HCT116 CDX model with tumor growth inhibition of 66% at 3 mg\/kg QD. Similarly, ISM3412 also demonstrated robust single-agent efficacy in CDX models of pancreatic cancer, bladder cancer and NSCLC, as well as in a PDX model of esophageal cancer. Notably, ISM3412 showed improved efficacy when combined with docetaxel, compared to the individual monotherapy. ISM3412, at 10 uM, showed no obvious agonistic or antagonistic effect on 44 selected targets in a mini safety panel, demonstrating its selectivity as a MAT2A inhibitor.<br \/>In addition to its strong biological potency and selectivity, ISM3412 exhibited favorable drug-likeness properties, including low molecular weight, good solubility and permeability, and low plasma protein binding. I<i>n vivo<\/i> PK data revealed low clearance and high oral-bioavailability. Further, it was well tolerated with no significant hepatobiliary toxicity. In conclusion, ISM3412 is a novel and highly selective MAT2A inhibitor for MTAP-deficient cancers, and merits clinical evaluation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synthetic lethality,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Qingyuan Meng<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiao Ding<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaosong Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Hailong Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Ling Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Junwen Qiao<sup>1<\/sup>, Hua Cao<sup>1<\/sup>, Yushu Yin<sup>1<\/sup>, Congcong Zhu<sup>1<\/sup>, Xing Liang<sup>1<\/sup>, Xin Cai<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuanyuan Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Chenxi Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Shan Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Sujata Rao<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, Feng Ren<sup>1<\/sup>, Alex Zhavoronkov<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Insilico Medicine, Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Insilico Medicine, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ae0bd2fe-3bea-4ff4-b43a-19c1de9b4d19","ControlNumber":"3284","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;Q.

It is frequently overexpressed across a variety of cancers. High adenosine level in the tumor microenvironment, predominantly signaling through the A2a\/A2b receptors, suppresses innate and adaptive immune responses and mediates tumor immune evasion. CD73 overexpression is correlated with poor prognosis in several tumor types. Inhibition of CD73 to reduce adenosine production is a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancer. Both monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors are being explored to target CD73. Small molecule CD73 inhibitor with good balance of activity and ADME properties are rare. Here we present BPI-472372, a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable small molecule CD73 inhibitor. It strongly inhibits both soluble and cell-bound CD73, with no off-target activity on other related nucleotidases (NTPDases 1\/2\/3\/5), nor on a large panel of enzymes, receptors, and ion channels. BPI-472372 reversed AMP-induced CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cell suppression in a dose-dependent manner. <i>In vivo<\/i>, BPI-472372 exhibited anti-tumor effect in MC38 syngeneic mouse model with no visible adverse effect.

BPI-472372 exhibited desirable drug-like properties including high permeability, low hepatocytes clearance, and adequate oral exposure across multiple pre-clinical species. GLP toxicity study indicated that BPI-472372 was well tolerated at high dose following 4 weeks repeated administration in both mouse and dog.

Despite being the first cancer analyzed through the Cancer Genome Atlas, treatment success remains minimal, resulting average survival time of patients is 15 months following diagnosis and a five-year survival rate is 6.8%. One of the major challenges in treating GBM is the presence of GBM stem cells (GSCs) that are resistant to temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy and radiation, which is part of the current standard of care for GBM following maximal surgical resection. We found, however, that GSCs have a unique dependence on core circadian clock proteins, Brain and Muscle ARNTL-Like 1 (BMAL1) and Circadian Locomoter Output Cycles Protein Kaput (CLOCK), which is not observed in differentiated GBM cells or normal neuronal stem cells. Here we explore the use of novel small molecule circadian clock compounds that either lower BMAL1 transcription (REV-ERB agonists) or inhibit BMAL1::CLOCK heterodimer transcriptional activity (Cryptochrome (CRY) stabilizers or Casein Kinase (CK) 1\/2 inhibitors) in targeting GSCs in <i>in vitro <\/i>patient derived cell lines and in <i>in vivo<\/i> GBM patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. GSCs display increased sensitivity to clock compounds at single agent and combinations of clock compounds compared to non-cancerous cells, U2OS human osteosarcoma cells, and differentiated GSCs. Additionally, clock compounds are significantly more effective in targeting GSCs than TMZ. The clock compound SHP1705 increased over survival and delayed tumor growth in GBM PDX models. These results highlight the therapeutic potential small molecule circadian clock compounds have against GBM as both a single agent and adjuvant to existing therapies by specifically targeting the GSC population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circadian genes,Glioblastoma multiforme,Cancer stem cells,Small molecule drugs,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Priscilla Chan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lian Wu<sup>2<\/sup>, Anahit Hovsepyan<sup>3<\/sup>, Seda Mkhitaryan<sup>3<\/sup>, Gevorg Karapetyan<sup>3<\/sup>, Khalid Shah<sup>4<\/sup>, Hiroaki Wakimoto<sup>5<\/sup>, Theodore Kamenecka<sup>6<\/sup>, Laura  A.

It is frequently amplified or overexpressed in cancer and confers resistance to relevant standard of care. Therefore, MCL1 is an attractive target to potentially re-sensitize tumors to conventional chemotherapy and targeted agents. Here we describe ANJ810 as a novel, potent, and selective MCL1 inhibitor which specifically induces apoptosis in cancer cells.<br \/>ANJ810 potently and reversibly binds to the BH3-binding groove of human MCL1 (K<sub>D<\/sub> = 0.3 nM), thereby inhibiting the interaction with the BH3-only protein NOXA (IC<sub>50 <\/sub>= 0.4 nM). ANJ810 shows a 4-log-fold greater selectivity to MCL1 over other anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-xL or Bcl-2. In cells, ANJ810 treatment rapidly (&#60; 15 min) disrupts the MCL1-BAK interaction with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#60; 10 nM, resulting in caspase-3 activation and cancer cell death. Knockout of BAK and BAX completely rescues cells from ANJ810 induced killing, indicating that initiation of cell death occurs through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.<br \/>Screening over 750 cell lines (PRISM), we found that ANJ810 induced anti-cancer activity in 222 cell lines with an IC<sub>50 <\/sub>&#60; 1 &#956;M across multiple solid and hematological cancers, including breast, lung, melanoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, and leukemia. The top genomic feature that correlates with sensitivity to ANJ810 treatment is the ratio of Bcl-xL\/BAK expression.<br \/>A key design principle of ANJ810 is its rapid systemic clearance to potentially minimize exposure-driven toxicities associated with MCL1 inhibition. ANJ810 induces efficient cancer cell killing within 4 hours in vitro but has no impact on cell viability or troponin I release in hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes at supra-pharmacologic concentrations.<br \/>In vivo, i.v. bolus injections of ANJ810 lead to short plasma residence time, yet are efficacious in xenograft models of multiple myeloma, DLBCL, NSCLC and HCC. ANJ810 will test the hypothesis in human clinical trials that short-term inhibition of MCL1 can overcome tumor resistance with an acceptable safety profile to improve current standard of care.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Novel anticancer agents,Apoptosis,Solid tumors,Mcl-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ulrike Rauh<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Guo Wei<sup>2<\/sup>, Michael Serrano-Wu<sup>3<\/sup>, Georgios Kosmidis<sup>4<\/sup>, Stefan Kaulfuss<sup>5<\/sup>, Franziska Siegel<sup>6<\/sup>, Kai Thede<sup>5<\/sup>, James McFarland<sup>2<\/sup>, Christopher Lemke<sup>2<\/sup>, Nicolas Werbeck<sup>6<\/sup>, Katrin Nowak-Reppel<sup>5<\/sup>, Sabine Pillari<sup>7<\/sup>, Stephan Menz<sup>6<\/sup>, Matthias Ocker<sup>3<\/sup>, Brian Hubbard<sup>3<\/sup>, Virendar Kaushik<sup>3<\/sup>, Karl Ziegelbauer<sup>8<\/sup>, Todd Golub<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Anji Onco, Inc, Cambridge, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA,<sup>3<\/sup>Anji Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Cambridge, MA,<sup>4<\/sup>Ncardia, Leiden, Netherlands,<sup>5<\/sup>Nuvisan Innovation Campus Berlin, Berlin, Germany,<sup>6<\/sup>Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany,<sup>7<\/sup>Independent Consultant Modeling & Simulation, Berlin, Germany,<sup>8<\/sup>Almirall R&D, Sant Feliu de Llobregat, Spain","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b0ff1f50-ff25-4a93-86db-93b13d556cf9","ControlNumber":"3376","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;U.

As all four PARP inhibitors on the market target both PARP1 and PARP2 isotypes, hematological toxicity issue emerged by PARP2 inhibition. To address the unmet need, we screened and optimized compounds exempt from the toxicity issue. Here, we present DM5167 as a new molecular entity with 0.41 nM of IC<sub>50<\/sub> on the catalytic activity of PARP1. In addition, DM5167 exhibits an inhibitory profile against various PARP isotypes that differs from the four commercial PARP inhibitors. Specifically, DM5167 shows selectivity for PARP1 6.88 and 347.83 fold greater than PARP2 in the <i>in vitro<\/i> enzyme assay and DNA trapping assay, respectively. This contrasts with the corresponding PARP1\/PARP2 selectivity values of 0.14 and 0.89 fold for olaparib, respectively. Moreover, DM5167 showed higher selectivity than AZD5305 in the enzymatic assay. The GLP toxicity studies assigned DM5167 as a safe compound based on its high NoAEL value, a general toxicity parameter. In addition, the safety margin of DM5167 was acceptable, indicating that DM5167 is a plausible drug candidate. To find suitable indications, we screened various human cancer cell lines using their inhibitory potentials against proliferation and colony formation. Several hits were seen in triple-negative breast cancer cell lines including MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-468 and HCC1395. In an orthotopic xenograft experiment in which MDA-MB-231 cells were implanted, oral administration of 50mpk of DM5167 inhibited tumor growth by 45.8%. In contrast, olaparib failed to reduce xenograft tumors derived from MDA-MB-231 cells.

Women of African ancestry (WAA) are twice as likely as women of European Ancestry (WEA) to be diagnosed with advanced TNBC with worse prognosis. Emerging data shows that insulin resistance and high circulating levels of insulin are more prevalent in WAA with invasive BCs than in WEA, and activation of the AKT\/mTOR pathway by insulin may occur in aggressive TNBC. Reports show diabetic patients treated with metformin, a biguanide drug used to treat diabetes type 2, have reduced incidence of BC and improved survival. However, anticancer actions of metformin require use of high drug doses with limiting side effects <i>in vivo<\/i>. To address this challenge, we used a structure-activity strategy to develop biguanide analogues with more potent anticancer action and safety at lower doses <i>in vivo<\/i>. Using TNBC cell proliferation <i>in vitro<\/i> to screen analogues, promising candidates were identified that exerted dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation at significantly lower doses than that of parental metformin (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.01). As antitumor effects of metformin are attributed in part to activation of LKB1-AMPK pathways, we find that biguanide analogues also strongly induce AMPK phosphorylation on Western immunoblots and significantly reduce phosphorylation of downstream mTOR signaling pathway components including p70S6K, S6 ribosomal protein and 4E-BP1. Further, analogues induce TNBC cell apoptosis <i>in vitro<\/i> at lower doses than metformin. <i>In vivo<\/i>, analogues were more effective than metformin in stopping human TNBC xenograft progression in nude mouse models (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.001). Notably, analogues were also more effective than metformin at blocking lung metastases in syngeneic murine 4T1 TNBC models (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.05). Transcriptome analyses comparing mammary tumors and lung metastases revealed that analogue JD006 down-regulated genes related to oxidative phosphorylation in lung metastases treated with JD006 and increased expression of genes related to T-cell activation. Further, gene expression in tumors treated with JD006 showed significant down-regulation of long non-coding RNAs that associate with the up-regulation of malignant transformation and activation of M1 macrophages. Importantly, our data indicate that analogue JD006 modulates the activity\/trafficking of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) that may significantly impact TNBC responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Further understating of potential biologic differences between TNBC of WAA and WEA is needed to design more effective therapeutic strategies to reduce TNBC health disparities. New targeted treatments could be beneficial for patients afflicted with this deadly disease.

Our efforts of developing effective therapies for TNBC have identified CET019, a novel small molecule that effectively inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells. We found that CET019 impedes the clonogenic potential and growth of triple-negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, SUM159 and 4T1). CET019 treatment induces the G2\/M phase cell cycle arrest in TNBC cells.

There are three main DSB repair pathways: homologous recombination (HR), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). HR is a high-fidelity, error-free DSB repair pathway, and the dysfunction of HR confers cell genome instability and leads to tumorigenesis. HR deficiency is especially prevalent in gynecologic tumors, sharing about 10% population of all the gynecologic tumor patients. In situation of HR deficiency, MMEJ, in which DNA polymerase theta (Pol&#952;) plays an essential role, is up-regulated to serve as a backup pathway for DSB repair. Several studies have proved that the inhibition of Pol&#952; causes synthetic lethality with HR deficiency. Hence, Pol&#952; emerges as a potential DNA damage repair target for the treatment of HR deficient tumors. Here we report a novel small molecular Pol&#952; inhibitor, SS008871, which inhibits Pol&#952; activity with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 22 nM, and strongly inhibits cellular MMEJ pathway with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of single-digital nanomolar level. SS008871 strongly inhibits proliferation of HR deficient BRCA2<sup>-\/-<\/sup> DLD-1 cells, and shows a &#62;125&#215; selectivity folds over DLD-1 parent cells as well as non-malignant cells. Besides, SS008871 elicits synergetic anti-proliferation activities in combination of a PARP inhibitor, olaparib on BRCA2<sup>-\/-<\/sup> DLD-1 and MDA-MB-436 cells. In the BRCA2<sup>-\/-<\/sup> DLD-1 xenograft model, SS008871 shows tumor growth inhibition as a single agent, and the combination of SS008871 and olaparib further results in tumor regression. Accordingly, the level of &#947;H2AX, a common DSB marker, correlates well to the anti-tumor efficacy. In a human hematopoietic stem cells based<i> in vitro<\/i> hematotoxicity assay, SS008871 shows no significant inhibition on lineage-specific (myeloid, erythroid and megakaryocytic) cell differentiation and survival, suggesting the low hematotoxicity risk. In comparison, olaparib significantly attenuated hematopoietic stem cells on both differentiation and survival in the parallel assay, which is consistent with the hematological toxicity observed in human. Furthermore, there is no clinical abnormalities observed after a high dose treatment of SS008871 in mice, demonstrating that SS008871 is well-tolerated. Taken together, SS008871 is proved to be an encouraging Pol&#952; inhibitor with good safety.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"H2AX,DNA double-strand break repair genes,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Feng Zhou<sup>1<\/sup>, Lu Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Lei Jiang<sup>2<\/sup>, Feng Tang<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhen Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Wenqing Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Liting Xue<sup>1<\/sup>, liting.xue@cn.simcere.com Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Renhong Tang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>State Key Laboratory of Translational Medicine and Innovative Drug Development, Jiangsu Simcere Pharmaceuticals Co.

YBX1 is known to contribute to tumorigenesis, disease progression and resistance by stabilizing the mRNAs of genes that are involved in cell growth and survival. High expression of YBX1 has been associated with poor clinical outcomes and decreased overall survival in over 20 cancer types including lung cancer. Given its critical roles in cancer progression and significant correlation with poor cancer prognosis, we hypothesized that inhibition of YBX1 may sensitize the cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. To profile the relationship between YBX1 and chemo-response, we aim to investigate the synergistic effect of YBX1 inhibition with standard of care chemotherapy drugs including cisplatin, in lung cancer using animal models and omics<i> <\/i>analysis. Our studies have found that SU056, a small molecule YBX1 inhibitor, effectively inhibits YBX1 expression in human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and halts their cell proliferation and clonogenic potential, whereas overexpression of YBX1 promotes cell proliferation.

Thus, Stat3 remains a validated and important target for the discovery of novel anticancer drugs. Despite this, the discovery and development of potent Stat3 small molecule inhibitors has proven to be a significant challenge, and no drug is available yet in the market. We have discovered novel Stat3 irreversible azetidine inhibitors with unprecedent submicromolar potency through systematic medicinal chemistry structure activity relationship (SAR). Mechanism of action of most potent azetidine inhibitors depend on whether they are salicylic acids or not, <i>i.e<\/i>., salicylic acids preferably bind irreversibly to Stat3 Cys426 site in the DNA-binding domain (DBD), and non-salicylic acids, <i>e.g.,<\/i> current lead H182, bind to Stat3 Cys468 DBD site. As expected, the inhibition of Stat3 DNA-binding activity was time dependent, with IC<sub>50<\/sub> in the range of 0.27-0.87 &#181;M at one hour incubation with active Stat3. On the other hand, azetidine salicylic acids also bind to the SH2 domain, although reversibly and at much weaker affinity, as determined in fluorescent polarization (FP) assay, with IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 10-16 &#181;M at one hour incubation, while non-salicylic acids, <i>e.g.,<\/i> lead H182, present no binding affinity up to 600 &#181;M for the SH2 domain. Despite that H182 does not bind to SH2 domain, it still inhibits its phosphorylation. Though lead compound H182 presents significant mouse<i> in vivo<\/i> efficacy, mouse <i>in vivo<\/i> pharmacokinetics shows very low plasma AUC, which correlates with quite high mouse<i> in vitro<\/i> hepatocyte CL<sub>int<\/sub> of 138 &#181;L\/min\/10<sup>6 <\/sup>cells; however, human <i>in vitro<\/i> hepatocyte assay gives much better results and is in the middle stability range (CL<sub>int<\/sub> of 14.6 &#181;L\/min\/10<sup>6 <\/sup>cells).

KRAS activating mutations lead to hyperactivation of the MAPK\/ERK signaling pathway, resulting in promotion of cell proliferation and growth. SOS1 is one of the major guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that regulates RAS proteins including KRAS. Since SOS1 plays a critical role in converting the GDP-bound inactive KRAS &#8220;off&#8221; state to the GTP-bound active KRAS &#8220;on&#8221; state, disruption of SOS1 and KRAS protein-protein interaction would be effective to block KRAS-driven oncogenic signaling regardless of its mutation status. Importantly, SOS1 activity is crucial during the reactivation of the KRAS\/MAPK signaling upon the treatment of RAS\/MEK\/ERK inhibitors, thus a SOS1 inhibitor would be an effective therapeutic option to treat KRAS-driven tumors in combination with RAS pathway inhibitors. We developed potent, selective, and orally available small molecules that effectively disrupt the interaction between SOS1 and KRAS. Current lead compounds originated from a virtual screening displayed excellent ADME and PK profiles. In cellular assays, a robust reduction of phospho-ERK level and cancer cell growth were shown. We also observed excellent <i>in vivo<\/i> antitumor activity in the mouse xenograft models.

Aggressive types of human cancer such as high-grade serous ovarian cancer and triple-negative breast cancer have elevated levels of CIN and frequently harbor <i>TP53<\/i> gene alterations and are poorly served by current treatment options. These two CIN+ cancer types also share mutually exclusive genetic alterations in <i>BRCA1<\/i> and <i>CCNE1 <\/i>cancer genes.<br \/>KIF18A is a mitotic kinesin motor protein that localizes to the plus-end tips of kinetochore microtubule (MT) spindle fibers, where it regulates chromosome alignment during cell division. KIF18A is overexpressed in a subset of human cancers, and its elevated expression is associated with tumor aggressiveness. Recent reports provide compelling evidence that genetic ablation of KIF18A reduced the viability of CIN cancer cells (Marquis et al. <i>Nature Com<\/i> 2021, Quinton et al. <i>Nature<\/i> 2021, Cohen-Sharir et al. <i>Nature<\/i> 2021).<br \/>Here, we report the discovery and preclinical characterization of AMG 650, a potent and selective inhibitor of KIF18A with a compelling anti-cancer profile distinct from other cell cycle and anti-mitotic drug targets. Structural insights gained by cryo-EM illustrate the unique binding mode of AMG 650 to an allosteric pocket at the interface of KIF18A motor &#945;4 and &#945;6 helices and &#945;-tubulin. AMG 650 selectively inhibits KIF18A MT-ATPase motor activity (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 48 nM) and exhibits specificity against a panel of diverse motor proteins. In cells, AMG 650 is active at double-digit nM concentrations and phenocopies KIF18A genetic KD\/KO dependencies across a panel of DNA-barcoded cancer cell lines. AMG 650 selectively activates the mitotic checkpoint resulting in multipolarity and apoptosis in breast and ovarian cancer cell lines enriched with CIN features. Notably, AMG 650 has minimal effects on proliferating human bone marrow mononuclear cells in culture at concentrations active on sensitive cancer cells (&#62;100X window). In vivo, AMG 650 has low clearance, long half-life, and good oral bioavailability across preclinical species. In mice, oral administration of AMG 650 induces a dose-dependent pharmacodynamic response (pH3 mitotic marker) that is sustained for 24 hours in OVCAR-3 tumor model. Importantly, continuous once-daily dosing with AMG 650 shows robust anti-cancer activity with evidence of durable tumor regressions in a subset of human ovarian and breast CDX\/PDX tumor models at well-tolerated doses. Lastly, the combination of AMG 650 with PARP inhibitor Olaparib enhances anti-cancer activity relative to single agent alone in <i>BRCA1-<\/i> and <i>CCNE1-<\/i>altered tumor models at well-tolerated doses. Collectively, our results provide a rational therapeutic strategy for selective targeting of CIN cancers via AMG 650, a first-in-class KIF18A inhibitor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinesin,Chromosomal instability,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Brian Belmontes<sup>1<\/sup>, Jodi Moriguchi<sup>1<\/sup>, Grace Chung<sup>1<\/sup>, Jan Sun<sup>1<\/sup>, Maria Stefania  S.

To identify genes uniquely essential to CIN<sup>high<\/sup> cells, we mined the Cancer Dependency map (DepMap) for genes required for proliferation of tumor cell lines with high levels of copy number aberrations, an indicator of CIN. This analysis identified KIF18A, a mitotic kinesin also identified by others as a vulnerability of aneuploid and whole genome doubled cells. Genetic disruption of KIF18A with RNAi confirmed its necessity in CIN<sup>high<\/sup> cells, and these findings translated to in vivo reduction in tumor growth, illustrating the potential of KIF18A as a therapeutic target.<br \/>High-throughput screening of a chemical library for inhibitors of KIF18A motor domain&#8217;s ATPase activity identified an ATP-noncompetitive hit that was optimized for potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties. These optimized inhibitors are orally bioavailable, exhibit sub-nM potency, and are highly selective for KIF18A vs. other kinesins. They also display a long drug-target residence time, a unique property that allows cells to be trapped in mitosis long enough to result in cell death. Mechanistically, inhibition of KIF18A&#8217;s ATPase activity renders KIF18A unable to localize to the metaphase plate, instead becoming trapped at the spindle poles. This inability to translocate results in defects in chromosome congression, evidenced by a less compact metaphase plate, and an accumulation of cells in G2\/M. Treatment of CIN cancer cells with these inhibitors results in a proliferative defect due in part to induction of programmed cell death. In contrast to the effect in cancer cells, KIF18A inhibition has no effect on rapidly proliferating non-transformed epithelial cells and primary T cells.<br \/>The differential impact between normal and cancer cells sets KIF18A inhibitors apart from other anti-mitotic therapies, which have had limited clinical benefit due to their detrimental impact on both cancer and highly proliferative normal cells. The therapeutic potential of KIF18A inhibitors was assessed in human tumor xenograft models. Treatment of multiple tumor models resulted in substantial, dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth. KIF18A inhibition in the tumor was confirmed through evaluation of KIF18A localization changes, chromosome congression and an increase in mitotic index.

AXL is expressed in cancer, stromal, and select immune cells, and has been implicated in the development of resistance to chemotherapy, targeted therapies &#38; immunotherapies. Activation of AXL can be mediated by its ligand, growth arrest specific protein 6 (GAS6), or via ligand-independent homo\/hetero-dimerization, both of which facilitate AXL phosphorylation, initiation of signaling cascades that promote cancer cell proliferation, survival, and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Here we present the discovery and characterization of a novel, highly potent and selective AXL inhibitor, AB801.<br \/>Materials and Methods: The potency and selectivity of AB801 against AXL and other kinases were determined using a panel of HTRF KinEASE-TK assays and via a competition binding assay utilizing DNA-tagged kinases. The effects of AB801 were further assessed by a cell-based phospho-AXL ELISA. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the molecule was evaluated in preclinical species. AB801 was characterized in routine <i>in vitro <\/i>safety assays, including hERG inhibition. Downstream signaling of AXL was evaluated by phospho-array, Western blot, and qPCR. Pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-tumor efficacy in combination with standard of care (SOC) therapies were assessed in murine cancer models.<br \/>Results: The novel AXL inhibitor AB801 is potent, reversible, and selective. AB801 exhibits cellular activity at low nanomolar concentrations and retains significant activity in 100% human serum. Excellent selectivity was observed against MERTK (860x), TYRO3 (1,400x), and the overall kinome. Importantly, AB801 does not show significant CYP450 or hERG inhibition. Favorable preclinical PK is consistent with projected once-a-day oral administration in humans. AB801 increases sensitivity to SOC therapeutics such as chemotherapy, and results in increased DNA damage. Moreover, AB801 treatment sensitizes tumors to checkpoint blockade by increasing immune cell activation. Significant anti-tumor efficacy is observed in combination SOC therapies in multiple <i>in vivo<\/i> models.<br \/>Conclusions: AXL inhibition is a promising therapeutic mechanism for impairing the growth of tumors resistant to SOC therapeutics. AB801 exhibits improved potency, selectivity, and safety profiles compared to other AXL inhibitors currently advancing into clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Axl,Kinases,Small molecule inhibitor,Therapy resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Susan Lee Paprcka<sup><\/sup>, Armon Goshayeshi<sup><\/sup>, Suan Liu<sup><\/sup>, Ruben Flores<sup><\/sup>, Lauren Rocha<sup><\/sup>, Jhansi  L.

It is urgent to identify new molecular targets and develop novel therapeutic agents against lethal mCRPC.<br \/>Methods: We developed a novel small-molecule anticancer compound named GH501 via a &#8220;molecular hybridization&#8221; approach. The <i>in vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity of GH501 was evaluated in the NCI-60 human cancer cell panel and human mCRPC cell lines. Molecular targets of GH501 were investigated using in silico docking, biolayer interferometry, cellular thermal shift assay, and other molecular and cellular approaches. The <i>in vivo<\/i> anticancer efficacy of GH501 against mCRPC was evaluated in clinically-relevant xenograft models.<br \/>Results: GH501 effectively inhibited the <i>in vitro<\/i> proliferation of NCI-60 human cancer cell lines and established mCRPC cell lines, including African American prostate cancer (PCa) cells, at nanomolar potency by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Mechanistically, GH501 might bind S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (Skp1) and disrupt the physical interaction between Skp1 and S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), thereby affecting multiple oncogenic signals implicated in mCRPC progression. RNA-Seq analyses indicated that GH501 treatment in C4-2 cells significantly inhibited E2F-, G2\/M checkpoint, c-Myc- and &#946;-catenin-regulated genes, androgen receptor (AR) transcription, androgen-responsive genes, and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)-activated genes. Proteomic studies identified 109 proteins upregulated and 154 proteins downregulated significantly by GH501 in CRW22Rv1 cells. The top physiological processes and signaling pathways affected by GH501 included cell cycle, autophagy, steroid biosynthesis, DNA replication, p53, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). As a lead compound, GH501 had excellent preclinical safety. In animal studies, GH501 monotherapy effectively inhibited the skeletal and subcutaneous growth of four mCRPC xenografts with heterogeneous genetic backgrounds.<br \/>Conclusion: These results support that pharmacological interruption of Skp1-Skp2 interaction is a promising therapeutic strategy for mCRPC. To our knowledge, GH501 is the first synthetic Skp1 inhibitor with a unique chemical structure that can serve as the basis for lead optimization and development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Metastatic and castration-resistance,Novel small-molecule Skp1 inhibitor,Preclinical drug development,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xin Li<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kenza Mamouni<sup>2<\/sup>, Rui Zhao<sup>3<\/sup>, Yifei Wu<sup>4<\/sup>, Zhong-Ru Xie<sup>5<\/sup>, Giuseppe Sautto<sup>6<\/sup>, Degang Liu<sup>7<\/sup>, Nathan Bowen<sup>1<\/sup>, Alira Danaher<sup>1<\/sup>, Lajos Gera<sup>8<\/sup>, Daqing Wu<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Center for Cancer Research and Therapeutic Development and Department of Biological Sciences, Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, GA,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta, GA,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Urology, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China,<sup>4<\/sup>School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Georgia, Athens, GA,<sup>5<\/sup>School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Georgia, Athens, GA,<sup>6<\/sup>Florida Research and Innovation Center, Cleveland Clinic, Port St. Lucie, FL,<sup>7<\/sup>Sartorius Corporation, Bohemia, NY,<sup>8<\/sup>Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical Campus, School of Medicine, Aurora, CO","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6e05b821-ae81-4bed-9a92-2cc1d96b7b71","ControlNumber":"3420","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>X.

Our previous studies found that Spm was significantly decreased in PCa tissue than in benign prostate tissue, as was the urinary Spm in PCa. This study aimed to reveal the specific role of Spm in PCa.<br \/>Materials &#38; Methods: In this study, Spm was resupplied to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells (PC3 and DU145). Following Spm treatment, MTT (methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium) and EdU (5-ethynyl-2&#8217;-deoxyuridine) assay were used to determine the cell proliferation of CRPC cell lines. Cellular apoptosis, cell cycle distribution and mitochondrial membrane potential were analyzed by flow cytometry. Cellular reactive Oxygen species (ROS) level was measured by fluorescence microscope. mRNA and ATAC sequencing in spermine-treated CRPC cells were performed to reveal the related mechanism for Spm effect.<br \/>Results: In the in vitro studies, Spm was found to inhibit the cell viability of CRPC cells. Transwell assays demonstrated that Spm impaired migration and invasion ability. And Spm blocked tumor progression by inducing G2\/M arrest and cellular apoptosis in CRPC cells dose-dependently. mRNA seq revealed that a series of genes were altered after Spm treatment and indicated the potential functional pathway of Spm might be mitophagy. We integrated mRNA seq data with ATAC seq profiles and accessed those genes regulated by polyamine metabolism and Spm-induced mitophagy. Results showed the sequencing tracks for the HMOX1 locus contain higher ATAC-seq peaks at the promoter under Spm treatment. Spm could affect oxidative phosphorylation which will lead to mitophagy and mitochondrial metabolism by modulating the transcriptional accessibility of genes. After Spm treatment, cellular ROS was upregulated while the mitochondrial membrane potential collapsed. Subsequently, western blot results showed that PINK1-mediated mitophagy related-proteins were significantly regulated.<br \/>Conclusion: Our results indicated that Spm treatment led to mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequently degraded through mitophagy in CRPC cells. Our findings could provide a theoretical basis and have preliminary clinical implications in developing Spm as a promising agent against CRPC by inducing cellular mitophagy in CRPC cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Polyamines,Autophagy,Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jingkai Sun<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Peter Ka-Fung Chiu<sup><\/sup>, Tingting Xie<sup><\/sup>, Jeremy Yuen-Chun Teoh<sup><\/sup>, Chi-Fai Ng<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Hong Kong, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2a530d06-5471-4422-82e4-90a882dee3f1","ControlNumber":"3468","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Since inhibition of tankyrases (TNKS1 and TNKS2) belonging to the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family stabilizes AXINs and induces degradation of &#946;-catenin, drug development as a therapeutic target for APC-mutated CRCs is required. To identify selective small molecule inhibitors of TNKS, we performed pharmacophore modeling and structural docking studies targeting nicotinamide, adenosine, and both binding subsites of TNKS. Among the 8 million compounds, 149 of the nicotinamide site binders, 23 of the adenosine site binders, and 15 of the dual-site binders of TNKS were selected through computer-based virtual screening. Using <i>in vitro<\/i> TNKS1 and TNKS2 enzyme assays, we identified that TI2-N17 and TI3-D11 significantly inhibited TNKS1 and TNKS2 enzyme activities at low nanomolar levels. TI2-N17 and TI3-D11 stabilized AXIN2, reduced active &#946;-catenin, and downregulated &#946;-catenin target genes in COLO320DM, APC-mutated CRC cells. Both compounds exhibited anticancer effects on COLO320DM and SW403 cells. In addition, the combination treatment of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), an anticancer agent for CRC patients, and these compounds synergistically inhibited the proliferation of CRC cells compared to single compound treatment. Our findings demonstrated that TI2-N17 and TI3-D11 are therapeutic candidates targeting TNKS for APC-mutated CRCs treatment and suggested that the combined treatment with the compounds and 5-FU chemotherapy may be an effective therapeutic strategy for APC-mutated CRCs. Based on these compounds, further study will develop potent and selective TNKS inhibitors by designing and synthesizing novel derivative compounds.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Small molecule inhibitor,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Hwani Ryu<sup><\/sup>, Hye-Ran Seo<sup><\/sup>, Hyo Jeong Kim<sup><\/sup>, <b>Jiyeon Ahn<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Korea Institute of Radiological & Medical Sciences (KIRAMS), Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cf049f12-ac3d-4c75-9ff8-1df1798d5b2b","ControlNumber":"4363","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

To address this considerable medical need, several generations of novel anti-tumor small molecule agents specifically targeting the estrogen-ER&#945; interaction have been synthesized and characterized. We are pursuing an alternative approach, activation of an endogenous cell death pathway downstream of ER&#945; with non-competitive Selective Estrogen Receptor Activators (SERAs). These compounds exhibit their effects by dysregulating calcium homeostasis in ER&#945;+ tumor cells leading to hyper-activation of the anticipatory unfolded protein response (a-UPR) and necrotic cell death, a mechanism distinct from current breast cancer therapeutics. These molecules cause increases in P-EIF2a and P-AMPK, and cleavage of ATF6&#945;, which are all hallmarks of the hyper-activation of a-UPR. SERA molecules cause death of ER&#945;+ breast cancer cells in culture with 24hr IC<sub>50<\/sub> values in the low nanomolar range, including breast cancer cell lines harboring ER&#945; mutations known to contribute to acquired ER&#945; modulator therapy resistance, while IC<sub>50<\/sub> values in ER&#945;-negative cells are orders of magnitude higher. In the MCF-7 ER&#945;+ breast cancer xenograft model, once weekly IV injections of SERA2 at 10mg\/kg cause durable, complete tumor regression, and SERA2 also has impressive activity in a challenging-to-treat PDX model that is resistant to fulvestrant and tamoxifen. SERAs are well-tolerated after multiple intravenous injections in mice, rats, and dogs, and clinical trial-compatible formulations have been developed.

In addition to have a critical role in cell cycle regulation, Aurora kinases have been shown to stabilize MYC-family oncoproteins for the maintenance of malignancy. Aurora kinase inhibitors such as Alisertib has demonstrated compelling anti-tumor efficacies; however, the reported side effects including serious haematological disturbances have limited its risk-benefit ratio in clinical use. In this study we discovered a novel pyrimidine-based Aurora kinase inhibitor compound A that degraded MYC- and MYCN- oncoproteins with better potency than Alisertib. The acyl-based prodrug design leads to the discovery of compound B which was able to regress MYC- or MYCN- overexpressing tumor xenografts including small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and medulloblastoma using a once-a-week (QW) oral dosing regimen. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the tumor\/plasma ratio of compound B was about 20 at 24 h post drug administration, and the active compound remained detectable in the tumors after 7 days. No significant haematological or liver\/kidney biochemical aberration was observed in mice treated with up to 500 mg\/kg of DBPR728 on a QW dosing regimen in a 21-day cycle. The unique pharmacokinetic and molecular properties of compound B hold potential clinical promise for treating MYC- and MYCN- amplified tumors with manageable on-target haematological adverse effects caused by Aurora kinase inhibition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myc,MYCN,Aurora kinase,Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ya-Hui Chi<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Chun-Ping Chang<sup><\/sup>, Teng-Kuang Yeh<sup><\/sup>, Wan-Ping Wang<sup><\/sup>, Yen-Ting Chen<sup><\/sup>, Chia-Hua Tsai<sup><\/sup>, Yan-Fu Chen<sup><\/sup>, Yi-Yu Ke<sup><\/sup>, Jing-Ya Wang<sup><\/sup>, Ching-Ping Chen<sup><\/sup>, Tsung-Chih Hsieh<sup><\/sup>, Mine-Hsine Wu<sup><\/sup>, Chiung-Tong Chen<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>National Health Research Insts., New Taipei, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"512aba23-00d0-41bc-a3ab-e9991fb8fe75","ControlNumber":"4220","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

One modality that has demonstrated success in NHLs is targeted protein degradation (TPD). Lenalidomide (LEN), a molecular glue degrader, is approved for treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and other NHLs. Avadomide (AVA), a next-generation molecular glue, showed compelling clinical NHL activity. Notably, because of rapid <i>in vivo<\/i> interconversion between the (<i>R<\/i>)- and (<i>S<\/i>)-enantiomers, both compounds have been developed as 1:1 mixtures of (<i>S<\/i>)- and (<i>R<\/i>)- enantiomers, despite only the (<i>S<\/i>)-enantiomer having the desired anticancer and immunomodulation activity. To overcome this issue, we used deuterium to lock the (<i>S<\/i>)-enantiomer of AVA in place, producing the new chemical entity, SP-3164. SP-3164 is a cereblon-binding molecular glue that selectively degrades Ikaros and Aiolos (I\/A). We have previously shown that SP-3164 effects rapid and deep degradation of Ikaros as compared to LEN and AVA and demonstrates tumor growth inhibition (TGI) <i>in vivo<\/i>. Importantly, we also demonstrated that the (<i>R<\/i>)-enantiomer (SP-3165) does not cause Ikaros degradation and has minimal activity <i>in vivo<\/i>, but instead may show negative off target effects in certain models. Here, we continue to explore SP-3164&#8217;s activity in NHLs and demonstrate its potential therapeutic advantages.<br \/>Results: We examined SP-3164&#8217;s ability to degrade Aiolos in comparison to LEN, AVA, and SP-3165 across several DLBCL cell lines (WSU-DLCL2, SU-DHL-5, SU-DHL-10, JVM-2 and U2932). SP-3164 (500 nM) caused significantly more Aiolos degradation than LEN (10 &#181;M) and performed comparably or better than AVA (1 &#181;M), while SP-3165 (500 nM) did not cause appreciable degradation. To further characterize SP-3164 and SP-3165, we used flow cytometry to distinguish their ability to induce apoptosis in NHL cells. Cells were treated with SP-3164 (1 &#181;M, 10 &#181;M) and SP-3165 (1 &#181;M) for 72 hours. SP-3164 induced both early and late-stage apoptotic markers in a dose dependent manner, while SP-3165 did not induce apoptosis, corroborating it is the inactive enantiomer. In an <i>in vivo<\/i> model of FL (DOHH2), SP-3164 (7.5 mg\/kg BID PO) showed significant antitumor compared to vehicle and the approved agent tazemetostat (300 mg\/kg BID PO). The combination of SP-3164 and tazemetostat was synergistic resulting in more significant TGI than SP-3164 alone. This suggests that SP-3164 may sensitize FL cells to tazemetostat, similarly to what has been demonstrated with LEN in DLBCL cells.<br \/>Conclusion: SP-3164 is a novel, orally available, CRBN-binding molecular glue with desirable therapeutic properties and significant anticancer activity in NHL models. Further assessment of SP-3164&#8217;s potential as a treatment for NHLs is warranted and a clinical trial is planned to start in 2023.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteasome-mediated degradation,Lymphoma,Preclinical,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Daniela  Y.

Leukemia stem cell (LSC) populations maintain the disease and serve as a reservoir for relapse. Therefore, treatments that can eradicate LSCs will improve the outcomes of patients with AML. Our preliminary data have shown that the interleukin-1 (IL-1) pathway is upregulated following treatment and disease progression in AML and plays an important role in LSCs <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. To target IL-1 signaling, we disclose the structure-activity relationship guided development of UR241-2, a novel small molecule compound of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1\/4 (IRAK1\/4), which are critical downstream factors in IL-1\/Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) signaling. UR241-2, at single dose (5 nM) screening exhibited high target selectivity; other than IRAK1\/4 only 9 kinases in a panel of 682 kinases were inhibited by &#62;25% activity. The NanoBRET assay using HEK293 cells transfected with targeted kinase vectors showed notably selective target engagement of UR241-2 against IRAK4 (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 6.07 nM). By using the <i>in vitro<\/i> NF-kB reporter assay and immunoblotting analysis, we identified that UR241-2 robustly inhibits IL-1\/TLR signaling in AML cells including the activation of NF-&#954;B and the phosphorylation of P65 and P38, following IL-1 stimulation. Next, we treated murine MLL-AF9 AML cells and human MDSL cells with UR241-2 and two IRAK4 inhibitors (PF-06650833 and CA-4948) that are currently in clinical or preclinical studies. We found that UR241-2 significantly inhibits colony-forming ability in AML and myelodysplastic syndromes, with similar or better efficacy compared to PF-06650833 or CA-4948. We also determined that UR241-2 suppresses LSC clonogenicity in primary human AML cells at diagnosis and in relapse while minimally impacting normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell function. Last, we investigated the impacts of UR241-2 on LSC engrafted ability <i>in vivo<\/i>. We treated murine MLL-AF9 cells with UR241-2 and PF-06650833 <i>ex vivo<\/i> for three days and transplanted them into recipient mice. After four weeks, we observed that UR241-2 significantly suppresses the engraftment levels of AML cells in bone marrow. It also decreases the WBC in peripheral blood and increases the RBC, HGB and PLT counts compared to the vehicle control group. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that targeting IRAK1\/4 using the novel compound UR241-2 is able to impair LSC clonogenicity and engraftment capability in AML following treatment and disease progression. This provides a potential therapeutic strategy to eradicate the LSC population and improve the outcome of AML patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute myeloid,Cancer stem cells,Small molecule drugs,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tzu-Chieh Ho<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Rakesh  K.

RMC-9805 is a first-in-class, oral, mutant-selective covalent inhibitor of the GTP-bound and active RAS(ON) form of KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>. The formation of a stable, high affinity tri-complex between RMC-9805, KRAS<sup>G12D <\/sup>and cyclophilin A results in the suppression of signaling downstream of KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>(ON) by disrupting its interactions with downstream effectors such as RAF kinases.<br \/>RMC-9805 treatment caused selective and persistent modification of KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> leading to deep and durable suppression of RAS pathway activity, inhibition of cell proliferation, and apoptosis induction in KRAS<sup>G12D <\/sup>human cancer cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i> and tumor models <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>In a mouse clinical trial with KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> xenograft tumor models, RMC-9805 administered orally as a single agent was well tolerated and induced objective responses in 7 of 9 PDAC PDX and CDX models and 6 of 9 NSCLC PDX models, as assessed by mRECIST. In the few models that exhibited sub-optimal responses to RMC-9805 monotherapy, combination treatment with various RAS Companion Inhibitors improved depth and\/or duration of anti-tumor response.<br \/><i><\/i> In contrast to RAS<sup>MUTANT<\/sup> NSCLC and PDAC, CRC tumors are less dependent on RAS driver mutations. For example, a more heterogeneous response to KRAS<sup>G12C <\/sup>inhibitors has been reported in CRC than in NSCLC patients, suggesting combinations will be desired to achieve significant clinical benefit in CRC. Likewise, RMC-9805 monotherapy is less active in CRC models at doses that were highly active in KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> NSCLC and PDAC models. However, combinations of RMC-9805 with vertical or parallel pathway RAS Companion Inhibitors such as SHP2, mTORC1 or RAS<sup>MULTI<\/sup>(ON) inhibitors, achieved objective response rates up to 60% and delayed the onset of resistance in tumor models <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>RMC-9805 also synergized with anti-PD1 therapy in KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> tumors in immune-competent animal models by shaping a favorable tumor immune microenvironment through cytokine modulation. In addition, RMC-9805 engaged the adaptive immune system by increasing presentation and recognition of tumor antigens, promoting a diversification of the TCR repertoire, and inducing immunological memory.<br \/>Overall, RMC-9805 monotherapy elicited tumor regressions in most preclinical PDAC and NSCLC cancer models harboring KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>. Furthermore, RMC-9805 combination therapies drove regressions in CRC models relatively less responsive to monotherapy. Supported by these findings, RMC-9805 is currently in IND-enabling development to permit clinical evaluation of single agent and combination strategies in patients with KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,In vivo,Tumor growth,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Lingyan Jiang<sup><\/sup>, Marie Menard<sup><\/sup>, Caroline Weller<sup><\/sup>, Zhican Wang<sup><\/sup>, Les Burnett<sup><\/sup>, Ida Aronchik<sup><\/sup>, Shelby Steele<sup><\/sup>, Mike Flagella<sup><\/sup>, Ruiping Zhao<sup><\/sup>, James W W.

We recently showed that the EOC microenvironment can induce metabolic reprogramming inCD11b<sup>+<\/sup>Gr1<sup>+<\/sup> cells by increasing oxidative phosphorylation via TCA cycle, resulting in increased immunosuppressive ability. Increased TCA cycle activity was due to glutamine anaplerosis, which was facilitated by the upregulation of DLST (dihydrolipoamide succinyl transferase), the E2transferase subunit of &#945;-KGDC (alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex). We selected CPI-613 (Devimistat), an orphan metabolic drug, being actively tested in clinical trials to target the a-KGDC complex. We utilized the syngeneic ID8<sup>p53-\/-<\/sup> model, a high grade serous ovarian cancer, to determine if CPI-613 may regulate CD11b+Gr1+ cell metabolism and immunosuppressive function and restore an antitumor immune response that inhibits EOC. One week after inducing tumors, mice were treated with CPI-613 (2.5mg\/kg body weight) twice a week by IP injections or with vehicle (corn oil, control). CPI-613 treated mice showed significantly improved overall survival (median survival 75 days versus 48 days in control), decreased tumor progression and burden.CPI-613 decreased the number of CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid cells in ascites, and more importantly, reduced the intracellular immunosuppressive markers arginase 1 and IL-1&#946;, indicating that the immunosuppressive potential was diminished, which was also validated by reversal of T cell suppression by CPI-613. The alleviation of immunosuppression was complemented by remarkable increase in CD8+ T effector cells. Further, combination of CPI-613 with anti-PD1(100ug\/mice, every 5<sup>th<\/sup> day for 4 weeks) significantly improved survival and potentiated the CD8+mediated anti-tumor response. CPI-613 inhibited expression of DLST and immunosuppressive markers in the CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid cells, accompanied by decreased oxidative phosphorylation and decreased glutamine anaplerosis. Interestingly CPI-613 treatment also decreased the tumor associated macrophages, increased the M1 marker CD38 and decreased M2 marker EGR2, which reflected in increased M1\/M2 macrophage ratio. Increased glutamine demand and addiction have been shown in variety of cancers, including EOC. We found that DLST expression corelates with worse progression free survival in the ovarian cancer TCGA dataset, implying that DLST is important in EOC cells. As a result, DLST targeting of aberrant glutamine metabolism will have the dual benefit of reducing CD11b+Gr1+ cell-mediated immunosuppression while also directly inhibiting tumor growth. Thus CPI-613 represents an attractive drug to target glutamine addiction and reduce immunosuppressive environment plaguing ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunosuppression,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,Glutamine metabolism,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mary Priyanka Udumula<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Harshit Singh<sup>1<\/sup>, Faraz Rashid<sup>1<\/sup>, Miriana Hijaz<sup>1<\/sup>, Radhika Gogoi<sup>2<\/sup>, Philip Philip A.<sup>1<\/sup>, Adnan Munkarah<sup>1<\/sup>, Shailendra Giri<sup>1<\/sup>, Ramandeep Rattan<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI,<sup>2<\/sup>Wayne State School of Medicine, Detroit, MI","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a02eef17-3db6-4bb4-812e-400a535720dc","ControlNumber":"4549","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Up to 30% of NSCLC acquire mutations that result in constitutive NRF2 pathway activity, which correlates with worse patient prognosis. NRF2 regulates antioxidant genes that confer cytoprotection and chemoresistance. Inhibiting NRF2 activity increases tumor susceptibility to chemotherapy in preclinical lung cancer models; however, there are no FDA-approved NRF2 inhibitors available. Because current inhibitors have low potency and specificity, we developed novel compounds that target the NRF2 pathway. Previously, a high throughput screen identified MSU-38225, which was efficacious in sensitizing chemoresistant lung cancer to chemotherapy in a mouse xenograft model. We sought to improve the poor pharmacokinetics of this compound and developed and characterized a series of novel derivatives with increased solubility.<br \/><b>Hypothesis: <\/b>Derivatives of<b> <\/b>MSU-38225 inhibit the NRF2 pathway and decrease cancer cell viability.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The efficacy of our NRF2 pathway inhibitors was assessed in A549 and H460 human lung cancer cells with constitutive NRF2 pathway activity using western blotting, RT-PCR, and MTT or Cell Titer Glow viability assays. Cell death and cell cycle analysis were evaluated using flow cytometry. Data were evaluated with one or two-way ANOVA and the Dunnett post-hoc test.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The NRF2 pathway inhibitors decreased NRF2 protein level in A549 and H460 cells by approximately 60%, as measured by western blotting. As a result, NRF2-mediated transcription of cytoprotective genes NQO1, GCLC, GCLM, and AKR1C2 were decreased by 30-60% (p&#60;0.05) by qPCR. Further, these compounds decreased lung cancer cell viability, as measured in an MTT assay, by 50% in A549 cells and by 90% in H460 (p&#60;0.05). We then evaluated a specific inhibitor, MSU-71, to determine the cause of decreased viability and found it did not induce annexin-V positive apoptosis. However, subsequent analysis of the cell cycle with propidium iodide univariate analysis showed MSU-71 arrests lung cancer cells. 50% of H460 and 75% of A549 cells were arrested in G2\/M (p&#60;0.05). Finally, we developed several &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry tool compounds that have equitable NRF2 pathway inhibition, which will aid in target identification of the new inhibitors.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Taken together, the new NRF2 pathway inhibitors are efficacious in blocking NRF2 activation.
