[{"Abstract":"The MDM2 oncogene is amplified and\/or overexpressed in various human cancers and elevated expression of MDM2 protein acts as a survival factor promoting cancer progression mainly through inhibition of the tumor suppressor p53. Here, we report a novel small-molecule chemical compound (MX69-114b) that we identified to induce MDM2 protein degradation resulting in reactivation of p53 and potent cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in MDM2-overexpressing acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We have previously identified a compound (MX69) that binds to the MDM2 C-terminal RING domain and induces MDM2 protein degradation. In the present study, we performed structural modification of MX69 and selected analog MX69-114b showing increased MDM2-targeting activity. MX69-114b exhibited significantly enhanced inhibitory and apoptotic effects on a group of MDM2-overexpressing ALL cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i> with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 0.08-0.14 &#181;M, representing a &#62;80-100-fold increase in activity compared to MX69. MX69-114b also showed inhibitory effects on xenografted human MDM2-overexpressing ALL in SCID mice at a much lower dose than did MX69. Importantly, MX69-114b had minimal or no inhibitory effect on normal human hematopoiesis <i>in vitro<\/i> and was very well tolerated <i>in vivo<\/i> in animal models. Based on the strong inhibitory and apoptotic activity against MDM2-overexpressing ALL, along with minimal or no toxicity to normal cells\/tissues, MX69-114b is a candidate for further development as a novel MDM2-targeted therapeutic drug for refractory ALL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MDM2,Small molecule inhibitor,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>tao Liu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lubing Gu<sup>1<\/sup>, Anna Mui<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhongzhi Wu<sup>2<\/sup>, Wei Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Muxiang Zhou<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e652a9b2-9fcc-4a23-92c2-09aeb9437b17","ControlNumber":"170","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

Therefore, hTERT is considered as an important target for cancer therapy. In the present study, we synthetized a new peptide, DS-2, based on the telomerase vaccine GV1001, a 16-mer peptide. The aim of this study is to evaluate the molecular mechanism of DS-2 on the anticancer activity by targeting hTERT in prostate cancer cells. The expression levels of hTERT in prostate cancer patients were measured. We compared the cytotoxic activity of GV1001 and DS-2 against different prostate cancer cell lines. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the effects of DS-2 on apoptosis. The scratch-wound assay and matrigel invasion assay were performed to determine the metastasis ability of prostate cancer cells. We further measured the telomerase enzyme activity of DS-2 in LNCaP cells. Furthermore, tumor-bearing nude mice were employed to evaluate the anticancer effect of GV1001 and DS-2. The cytotoxicity of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) on prostate cancer cells was determined by lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH)-release assay. The hTERT expression was directly correlated with telomerase activity in LNCaP cells, and DS-2 significantly inhibited telomerase enzyme activity, resulting in reducing LNCaP cells proliferation and metastasis. Furthermore, DS-2 exhibited the most substantial anti-cancer potential against prostate cancer cells compared with different cancer cell lines. In the tumor-bearing nude mice model, DS-2 significantly inhibited the growth of the prostate tumor and downregulated the expression of hTERT and Ki-67 in the tumor tissue as evidenced by western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis, respectively. Furthermore, the potent cytotoxicity was exhibited in LNCaP cells after treated with DS-2-activated PBMC plus IL-2. In addition, DS-2 synergistically enhanced IL-2 production from activated PBMC. These data indicated that the inhibition of hTERT expression by DS-2 suppressed prostate cancer cell growth and induced anti-cancer immunity. Therefore, DS-2 might be used as a novel therapeutic drug for cancer immunotherapy by targeting hTERT in prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,TERT,Peptides,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jae Hyeon Park<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Joo Kyung Shin<sup><\/sup>, Joo Hee Han<sup><\/sup>, Hyung Sik Kim<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Sungkyunkwan University College of Pharmacy, Suwon, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"984a5c60-18b2-44f0-855b-235af3d0b50f","ControlNumber":"740","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

While multiple HER2-targeted therapies are FDA-approved for breast cancer, the clinical utility of targeting HER2 in bladder cancer patients remains undefined. We leveraged a prospective sequencing initiative and a new collection of patient-derived organoid (PDO) and xenograft (PDX) models to explore the prevalence of HER2 alterations in bladder cancers, its biologic role in bladder cancer pathogenesis and the potential clinical utility of HER2-targeted therapies.<br \/>Methods: To define the landscape of HER2 alterations in bladder cancer patients, we analyzed data generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and patients enrolled in the prospective MSK-IMPACT sequencing cohort. To study the biology of HER2 alterations in a bladder cancer context, we generated PDO and PDX bladder cancer models, including <i>ERBB2 <\/i>amplified, <i>ERBB2 <\/i>hotspot mutated and <i>ERBB2 <\/i>wildtype models. Patient-derived models were characterized using a multiplatform approach and were used to study HER2 oncogenic dependence and sensitivity to multiple anti-HER2 targeted agents.<br \/>Results: The MSK-IMPACT assay revealed that <i>ERBB2 <\/i>alteration is common in bladder cancer, with a mutation frequency of 10.4% (breast cancer: 2.8%) and amplification frequency of 7.8% (breast cancer: 11.8%). <i>ERBB2 <\/i>alterations were more common in higher grade and stage bladder cancers. Among the HER2-altered PDOs, we identified some models with HER2 pathway dependence, similar to that observed in HER2 amplified breast cancer cell lines. However, most models had less dependence of downstream effector pathways such as AKT and ERK on HER2 signaling as compared to breast cancers. HER2-altered PDX models were significantly more sensitive to the HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) than to HER kinase inhibitor neratinib. We also observed a complete response of a HER2+ bladder cancer patient treated with T-DXd (based on PET at 7 weeks). Sensitivity to the T-DXd payload, an exatecan derivative (DXd), was found to play a key role in determining sensitivity of bladder cancer models to T-DXd.<br \/>Conclusion: Bladder cancer has higher <i>ERBB2 <\/i>mutation frequency than breast cancer, and HER2 alterations are more common in high grade and stage bladder cancers than in low-grade and non-invasive tumors, suggesting a role for HER2 in invasion and metastatic progression. The greater sensitivity of HER2 altered bladder cancer models to HER2-targeted ADC T-DXd and the complete response to T-DXd in a HER2+ bladder cancer patient provide justification for further clinical trials of HER2-targeted ADCs in bladder cancer. The sensitivity to ADC cytotoxic payload may be an important factor in determining patient response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HER2,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Bladder cancer,Organoids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xinran Tang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ziyu Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Jasmine Thomas<sup>1<\/sup>, Karan Nagar<sup>1<\/sup>, John Christin<sup>2<\/sup>, Naryan Rustgi<sup>1<\/sup>, Sizhi Gao<sup>1<\/sup>, Carissa Chu<sup>1<\/sup>, Elisa De Stanchina<sup>1<\/sup>, Michael  F.

Although standard-of-care agents are well tolerated in CLL, patients with certain genetic subsets of the disease continue to display poor response to these therapeutic regimens. Menin is an epigenetic protein that drives oncogenic function through transcriptional regulation directed by its interactions with various protein partners. In the B-cell maturation pathway, menin regulates a distinct set of genes targets (Li et al., 2013). We previously described the potent activity of BMF-219, a selective covalent oral menin inhibitor, against a diverse panel of CLL patient specimens with various cytogenetic and mutational backgrounds, including TP53 and NOTCH1 mutations. We also reported the ability of BMF-219 to downregulate the anti-apoptotic gene, <i>BCL2<\/i>, an established major driver of CLL, in acute leukemia cells. Here, we provide insights into the molecular impact of BMF-219 in CLL patient samples, as revealed through gene expression profiling of CLL specimens from BTK-inhibitor experienced patients that represent clinical profiles of TP53 mutated and complex cytogenetic backgrounds (del 13q, del 6q). BMF-219 displayed on-target activity through dose dependent reduction of the target gene, <i>MEN1<\/i>, in the treated patient samples. Differential gene expression analysis revealed alteration of additional novel gene targets, including reduction of <i>BCL2 <\/i>and genes modulated in response to prior BTK-inhibitor treatment. Gene set enrichment analysis highlighted top altered molecular pathways in BMF-219 treated CLL models. Notably, the KRAS signaling pathway was a top downregulated pathway in the BMF-219 treated CLL samples. We previously reported KRAS to be impacted by BMF-219 in solid tumor indications. Gene ontology analysis of biological processes and molecular function identified additional novel mechanisms elicited by BMF-219 in these treated CLL models. Furthermore, we provide new data demonstrating the superior potency of BMF-219 and ability to achieve &#62;98% growth inhibition in ex vivo cultured CLL patient specimens when compared to new investigational drugs currently in clinical development and established standard-of-care agents for CLL. Collectively, these data demonstrate the mechanistic impact of BMF-219 on key gene targets and molecular pathways modulated by covalent menin inhibition, further highlighting its potential as a novel therapeutic agent in CLL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,menin,KRAS,B cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Priyanka Somanath<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Daniel Lu<sup><\/sup>, Mini Balakrishnan<sup><\/sup>, Thomas Butler<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Biomea Fusion, Inc., Redwood City, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7b860342-6ee7-44e6-820b-de0dfed4405c","ControlNumber":"2056","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;P.

Approximately 70% of BC was ER<sup>+<\/sup>, in which estrogen receptor &#945; (ER&#945;, encoded by <i>ESR1<\/i> gene) drives dysregulated cell proliferation. In clinic, ER+ BC has been effectively treated by endocrine therapy targeting estrogen or ER. As the first approved ER&#945; degrader, fulvestrant has proven to be effective for locally advanced or metastatic BC. However, its clinical utilization is hampered by inconvenience of intramuscular injection, as well as its poor PK\/PD profile and limited efficacy, especially in the patient population that developed<i> ESR1<\/i> mutation-conferring drug resistance after the earlier line of treatment with an aromatase inhibitor. Thus, developing an oral and more effective therapy for ER+ BC remains an unmet medical need. We report herein discovery and preclinical investigation of a novel orally bioavailable SERD TFX06. TFX06 demonstrated potent binding affinity to ER&#945; with a Ki of 0.10 nM and preferably antagonized ER&#945; to ER&#946; with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> value of 0.086 nM and 2.83 nM, respectively. TFX06 potently induced ER&#945; degradation in ER+ BC cells and substantially inhibited cell proliferation in BC cell lines with ER wild type (WT), and MCF-7 cells expressing Y537S or D538G mutants. Oral administration of TFX06 demonstrated impressive antitumor efficacy in ER WT (TGI = 101%) and ER D538G-expressing (TGI = 99%) MCF-7 cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) models in mice. Similarly, in an ER+ BC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model (HCI-013) with ER Y537S mutation, TFX06 also exerted excellent antitumor activity (TGI = 99%). Furthermore, TFX06 in combination with palbociclib achieved synergistic activity in MCF-7 CDX model. Moreover, TFX06 exhibited an excellent correlation between systemic\/local drug exposure, pharmacodynamic modulation (i.e., ER&#945; downregulation) and antitumor activity. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that TFX06 is a novel, orally bioavailable SERD. TFX06 demonstrates substantial antitumor activity in both <i>in vitro and in vivo<\/i> preclinical tumor models, including those expressing <i>ESR1<\/i> mutations, through downregulation of ER&#945;.

In cancer cells, the abnormality in MAPK pathway associates with the mutation occurred in the upstream KARS or BRAF. Blockage of the pathway with MEK1\/2 inhibitors result in inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. It hence has the potential for clinical benefits for treating cancers with RAS\/RAF dysfunctions.ABM-168 is a novel small molecule, allosteric, highly selective MEK inhibitor with high water solubility, cell permeability and brain penetration. We have demonstrated its anti-cancer efficacy in vitro in multiple cancer cell lines, and in vivo in several xenograft, subcutaneous, intracardiac and intracranial, animal models. In-vitro data showed the similar on-target enzyme activity of ABM-168 to marketed MEK inhibitors, as well as high anti-proliferation activities (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#60;30nM) in multiple cancer cell lines with BRAF or RAS or NF1 mutation like A375, Colo-829, HT-29, MiaPaca-2, LN-229 etc. In vivo pharmacology studies demonstrated that ABM-168 had good potencies of tumor growth inhibitions with oral dose alone or combo with other drugs or compounds in multiple xenograft cancer models: In an A375-luc intracardiac melanoma metastatic model, ABM-168 at 2 mg\/kg PO BID demonstrated an antitumor activity comparable to ABM-1310 (A highly BBB-permeable BRAF inhibitor developed by ABM Therapeutics) at different dose levels and frequencies. On Day 28, the BLI% decreased 95.5%, 93.2%, 99.44% and 99.7% for ABM-168 (2 mg\/kg), ABM-1310 at 1 mg\/kg PO QD, 5 mg\/kg PO QD and 2.5 mg\/kg PO BID, respectively. In a LN229 glioblastoma orthotopic model in BALB\/c nude mice, ABM-168 at 5-10 mg\/kg PO QD showed a significant activity, the BLI (%) decreased in the brain 68 % on Day 49. These results indicate that the BBB-permeable ABM-168 may be efficacious as a single agent or combo with ABM-1310 to treat BRAF-mutant, advanced cancers with or without brain metastases or primary CNS tumors with an abnormal up-regulated MAPK signal. Non-clinical pharmacokinetics studies also showed that ABM-168 had a favorable ADME profile both in vitro and in vivo, and good brain penetration in animals. Single-dose, seven-day repeat dose non-GLP studies and four-week GLP toxicity studies in SD rats and beagle dogs were all completed. Based on these supportive preclinical study results, the IND of ABM-168 was submitted in 2022 Q3 to investigate its safety in human, which will be followed by further clinic development as a single agent, or in combination with other molecules to treat advanced cancers resulted from the abnormal MAPK signal pathway, particularly with brain tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MEK inhibitor,Brain metastasis,Brain tumors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Chen Chen<sup><\/sup>, Charles Huang<sup><\/sup>, Min Xu<sup><\/sup>, YouQin Chen<sup><\/sup>, Lanjiao Zhao<sup><\/sup>, Yang Chen<sup><\/sup>, <b>Yong Hu<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>ABM Therapeutics, San Diego, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0c1a6f7a-de54-4ffc-a864-eb8f8f948c19","ControlNumber":"2519","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;C.

Currently, a Phase I clinical trial of ABM-1310 is actively recruiting patients at multiple clinical centers in US.BRAF mutation takes place in about 8% of all tumors, among which around 90% is V600E amino acid mutation. BRAFv600 mutation causes BRAF&#8217;s continuous activation, and results in cancerous cells eventually. Melanoma is the most common cancer type with BRAFv600 mutation, and ~50% of melanoma will develop brain metastasis. Similar situation also occurs in other cancer types like papillary carcinoma of thyroid gland, low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, colon cancer, and lung cancer with lower rate. A few of primary CNS solid tumors also have significant BRAFv600 mutation rate. Currently, FDA has approved three combination therapy of BRAF inhibitor (i.e., dabrafenib\/Tafinlar&#174;, vemurafenib\/Zelboraf&#174;, and encorafenib\/Braftovi&#174;) to treat patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, with metastatic NSCLC, with locally advanced or metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) with BRAF V600E mutation. These combination therapies of BRAF and MEK inhibitors demonstrated clinical benefit, but they all shown poor efficacy on intracranial tumor lesions, which may be due to the limited BBB-penetration of these BRAF\/MEK inhibitors. Thus, to treat intracranial tumors with BRAFv600 mutation is still a big unmet medical need currently. Here, we shown preclinical results that ABM-1310 has significantly improved BBB-penetration compared with approved BRAF inhibitors: in mice, B\/P ratio and K<sub>p,uu <\/sub>values were 0.2 and 0.2 for Vemurafenib, 0.025 and 0.021 for Dabrafenib, 0.006 and 0.03 for Encorafenib, 0.27 and 1.0 for ABM-1310. Also, in the A375-luc intracranial model, ABM-1310 alone or combo with ABM proprietary, BBB-penetrable MEK inhibitor ABM-168, demonstrated significant improved antitumor activity and animal medial survival time (MST) compared with combination regimens of other BRAF\/MEK inhibitors (vemurafenib + cobimetinib, dabrafenib + trametinib, or encorafenib + binimetinib). Either ABM-1310 as a single agent or the combination of ABM-1310 and ABM-168 showed a BLI decrease (%) &#62; 99% on Day 26 and MST of &#62; 69 days, while MST for vehicle was 27 days, and MST for the combo of Dabrafenib and Trametinib was 33 days. In a primary GBM model (DBTGR-05MG, a BRAFv600 mutant GBM cell line), the similar result was demonstrated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain metastasis,BRAF,Blood-brain barrier,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Chen Chen<sup><\/sup>, Charles Huang<sup><\/sup>, Min Xu<sup><\/sup>, YouQin Chen<sup><\/sup>, Lanjiao Zhao<sup><\/sup>, Xiaobing Lv<sup><\/sup>, Chen Yang<sup><\/sup>, <b>Yong Hu<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>ABM Therapeutics, San Diego, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1f281381-d947-4ed8-b067-ee1fa5501e44","ControlNumber":"2524","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;C.

FDA currently approved sotorasib provides breakthrough therapy for cancer patients with KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutation, however there is still high unmet medical need for new agents that target a broader KRAS mutated tumors. A new opportunity emerges to develop a pan KRAS inhibitor by suppressing the upstream guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) protein son of sevenless 1 (SOS1). SOS1 is a key activator of KRAS and facilitates the conversion of GDP-bound KRAS (off) state to GTP-bound KRAS (on) state. Binding to its catalytic domain, small molecule SOS1 inhibitor prevents KRAS activation and suppresses cancer cell proliferation.<br \/>Material and Methods: Regor&#8217;s unique Computer Accelerated Rational Design (CARD) technology platform was applied to identify potent and selective SOS1 inhibitors.

ADT030 is a novel non-COX inhibitory sulindac-derivative designed to target RAS and phosphodiesterase 10 (PDE10) to block MAPK\/AKT signaling and activate cGMP\/PKG signaling to suppress oncogenic &#946;-catenin transcription, respectively. ADT-030 potently and selectively inhibits growth and induces apoptosis of a variety of cancer cell lines and has robust antitumor activity in multiple mouse tumor models by oral administration. However, the impact of ADT-030 on the tumor microenvironment (TME) has not been examined. Here we report the antitumor activity and immunomodulatory effect of ADT-030 in preclinical models. We show that oral administration of ADT030 significantly inhibited the growth of multiple types of murine tumors in immunocompetent mice. In a metastatic breast tumor model (4T1), ADT-030 not only delayed the growth of the primary tumor but also reduced tumor metastasis, leading to improved mouse survival. Immunological analysis revealed marked reduction of MDSCs in mice, and increased T cell tumor infiltration after ADT-030 treatment. The antitumor activity of ADT030 was diminished in immunodeficient mice or immunocompetent mice depleted of CD8+ T cells, suggesting the dependence of ADT-030 on host immunity. Moreover, the combination of ADT-030 and anti-PD-1 antibody therapy led to further improved tumor growth control and mouse survival. Bulk and single-cell RNAseq is being conducted to determine the impact of ADT-030 on the cell compositions and transcriptomic changes in the TME. Altogether, our study provides insight into the mechanism of action of ADT-030 and underscores the potential of ADT-030 as a monotherapy or in combination with immunotherapies for RAS and Wnt\/&#946;-catenin driven cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras,&#946;-catenin,Inhibitors,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Md Yeashin Gazi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ogacheko Okoko<sup>1<\/sup>, Xin Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Caitlin Brandle<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhi-chun Ding<sup>1<\/sup>, Amit Mitra<sup>2<\/sup>, Veronica Ramirez-Alcantara<sup>3<\/sup>, Xi Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Adam Keeton<sup>2<\/sup>, Yulia Maxuitenko<sup>2<\/sup>, Gary Piazza<sup>2<\/sup>, Gang Zhou<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, GA,<sup>2<\/sup>Auburn University, Auburn, AL,<sup>3<\/sup>University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a802b8bc-3685-4041-9e8b-320edcb64bf7","ControlNumber":"1524","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Although PKM2 is overexpressed in various tumor tissues, its functional role in cancer chemotherapy remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the anticancer activity of novel PKM2 inhibitors in the regulation of cell metabolism and its associated pathways in prostate cancer cells. To evaluate the molecular basis of specific PKM2 inhibitors, the interactions of compounds 3h and 3K with the PKM2 protein were assessed via molecular docking. We found that, compared to compound 3K, compound 3h exhibited a higher binding affinity for PKM2. Moreover, compound 3h significantly inhibited the pyruvate kinase activity and PKM2 expression. Cytotoxicity and colony formation assays revealed the potent anticancer activity of compound 3h against LNCaP cells. Compound 3h significantly increased the apoptotic and autophagic cell death in LNCaP cells. In addition, compound 3h induced AMPK activation along with the inhibition of mTOR\/p70S6K pathway. Furthermore, compound 3h significantly inhibited glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, as determined by analyzing extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) production. Our results revealed that compound 3h caused apoptotic and autophagic cell death by inhibiting cancer cell metabolism in LNCaP cells.

CCAs are divided into three subtypes: intrahepatic (iCCA, 10-20%), perihilar (pCCA, 50-60%) or distal (dCCA, 20-30%). CCA has a very poor prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of 5-15%. The majority of CCA patients (~80%) present with unresectable disease where gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GemCis) is the standard treatment with a median survival of 14 months. Nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab) paclitaxel (NPT) is an approved treatment for breast cancer, NSCLC and pancreatic cancer that is under clinical investigation for several solid tumors including CCA. Increased accumulation and secretion of serotonin have been reported to support its oncogenic activity in CCA. Telotristat ethyl (TE) is an inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) that mediates peripheral serotonin synthesis. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of TE in combination with standard chemotherapies in preclinical models of CCA.<br \/>Methods: Tumor growth studies were performed in subcutaneous cell-derived xenografts (CDX) using human CCLP-1 cells (iCCA), TFK-1 cells (dCCA), SNU-1196 cells (pCCA) in NOD\/SCID mice, and in patient-derived xenografts (PDX) in NSG mice. Animal survival studies were performed in peritoneal dissemination xenografts in NOD\/SCID mice using iCCA CCLP-1 cells. Intratumoral proliferation and serotonin levels were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC).<br \/>Results: In peritoneal dissemination xenografts, animal survival was markedly enhanced by NPT (60%), while TE (11%) or GemCis (9%) had a marginal effect. The combination of TE with GemCis (26%) or NPT (68%) exhibited a further increase in animal survival. In iCCA xenografts, tumor growth inhibition by TE was 53%, and NPT (69%) caused greater inhibition than GemCis (53%). In dCCA xenografts, tumor growth inhibition by TE was 51%, and NPT (56%) was more effective than GemCis (37%). In pCCA xenografts, tumor growth reduction by TE, NPT and GemCis was 41%, 67% and 58%. In all three cell-derived xenografts, TE combination with chemotherapy demonstrated an improved tumor growth inhibition effect (range: 67-90%). In PDX studies, TE markedly inhibited tumor growth (range: 40-73%), and GemCis caused a greater reduction (range: 80-86%) than NPT (57-76%). Again, an additive effect was observed with the combination of TE and chemotherapy. In all CDX and PDX subcutaneous tumors, reduction in tumor cell proliferation, measured by Ki67 staining, corresponded with tumor growth inhibition data. Further, decreased levels of serotonin were observed by TE treatment in all CDX and PDX tumors.<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>In several CCA preclinical models, TE exhibited marked antitumor efficacy and it enhanced GemCis or NPT chemotherapy response. Hence, combination therapies with TE have the potential to improve clinical CCA therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cholangiocarcinoma,Chemotherapy response,Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Lily Darman<sup>1<\/sup>, Margaret A.

Despite extensive study, treatments remain highly toxic and are often insufficient to cure. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop more effective and less toxic treatments for children with NB. NB commonly displays reliance on a relatively small cohort of transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic proteins to drive cell growth, however, many of these targets are inaccessible with conventional small molecules. In recent years, new modalities such as targeted protein degradation (TPD) have emerged. TPD may permit small molecule degradation of traditionally &#8220;undruggable&#8221; targets, such as TFs. This makes TPD a particularly attractive modality for defining new therapeutic strategies for high-risk NB. One category of TPD agents are molecular glues (MGs). MGs are monovalent small molecules capable of simultaneously binding to an E3 ligase receptor such as CRBN (cereblon), and a target protein of interest. Importantly, in comparison to conventional protein inhibitors, MGs do not require a conventional binding pocket on the protein of interest to bind to it, and can be utilized in sub-stoichiometric concentrations. Thus, this may result in the recruitment, polyubiquitination, and subsequent proteasomal degradation of proteins previously thought to be &#8220;undruggable.&#8221; Here, we demonstrate that high-risk NB cells are critically sensitive to a cluster of previously unknown MGs. We performed high-throughput screening of a proprietary library (&#62;4000 unique compounds) of MGs in two <i>MYCN<\/i>-amplified NB cell lines, Kelly and MHHNB11. These two cell lines demonstrate a strikingly close correlation in Cell-Titer Glo-based growth response to MGs, as compared with an outgroup of other MG-responsive cancer cell lines. We identified a unique subcluster of 112 common MGs that display &#62;70% growth inhibition in both cell lines. To identify the mechanism of cell growth inhibition, we established Kelly cells with stable knockout of <i>CRBN<\/i>, and coupled these with screening to confirm that the majority of these MGs (84%; 94\/112) require CRBN expression. To rule out common off-target effects of MGs, candidate compounds were then tested in cells transgenically expressing either wild-type or degradation-resistant GSPT1 (G575N) constructs, revealing a subset of MGs retaining cytotoxicity without effecting GSPT1 protein levels. Current studies are focused on determining the targets of these high confidence MGs, as a foundation for preclinical <i>in vivo <\/i>studies. These studies will identify new compounds with defined mechanisms of action, with an ultimate goal of developing new treatments that are more effective and less toxic for children with NB.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroblastoma,Pediatric cancers,Screening,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ian Delahunty<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Gisele Nishiguchi<sup>1<\/sup>, Yang Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Abigail Fish<sup>1<\/sup>, Anand Mayasundari<sup>1<\/sup>, Jun Qi<sup>2<\/sup>, Brian Abraham<sup>1<\/sup>, Anang Shelat<sup>1<\/sup>, Zoran Rankovic<sup>1<\/sup>, Adam Durbin<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN,<sup>2<\/sup>Dana Farber Cancer Insitute, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"84cfb0c0-8138-43b3-8d03-d00701e84794","ControlNumber":"1387","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>I.

Although deficiencies in these responses promote cancer initiation and progression via accumulated mutations, they also provide targetable vulnerabilities relatively specific to cancer cells that can be exploited with the use of DDR inhibitors. The cell cycle checkpoint kinases CHK1 and CHK2 are prime targets of DDR inhibitors, working with the key upstream regulators of the DDR signaling cascade, ATR and ATM, respectively, to halt cell cycle progression and initiate DNA repair via distinct but overlapping pathways. CHK1 and\/or CHK2 inhibitors have been developed in the past. However, many of them were discontinued before making to phase III clinical trials, in most cases owing to severe side effects induced by their non-specific nature. Others are related to their limited clinical efficacy, such as SRA737 which selectively inhibits CHK1 but not CHK2. Prexasertib (LY2606368), one of the few agents to undergo clinical trials, specifically inhibits both CHK1 and CHK2, displaying obvious therapeutic effects but also raising inevitable target-associated drug toxicities and a potential compliance issue due to intravenous administration. Given the fact that CHK2 aids in the coordination with CHK1 pathway, adjustment in the intensity of inhibition to both kinases could provide a suitable balance between efficacy and toxicity. Here, we describe the characterization of XS-02, a novel and orally bioavailable CHK1 inhibitor with moderate potency against CHK2, which shows manageable side effects and broad antitumor activity in various solid tumors, including tumors resistant to PARP inhibitors. XS-02 specifically inhibited both CHK1 and CHK2 kinases in different degree with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 2 and 282 nM, respectively.<i> In vitro<\/i> western blotting assays demonstrated that XS-02 decreased phosphorylation of CHK1 completely but partially for CHK2 in OVCAR3 cancer cells. Its potency against proliferation of cells with low nM IC<sub>50<\/sub> was exhibited in multiple cancer cell lines instead of normal cells. Oral dosing of XS-02 as a single agent induced dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition of OVCAR3 and MD-MBA-436 xenografts. Moreover, the combination of XS-02 and olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, accelerated tumor regression, which synergy was confirmed in a patient-derived tumor xenograft animal model of acquired resistance to olaparib, without significant body weight changes. <i>In vivo <\/i>assays showed that XS-02 was generally well tolerated with an acceptable oral bioavailability across multiple non-clinical species. These results support the agent as a clinical candidate for the treatment of solid tumors. An Investigational New Drug application is planned for 2023.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Solid tumors,CHK1 Inhibitor,oral bioavailability, DNA damage response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Xin Gao<sup>1<\/sup>, Yonggang Liao<sup>2<\/sup>, Qi Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Ling Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Chunyan Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, Yanfen Teng<sup>1<\/sup>, Lei Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Wenyuan Qian<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Xiaohong Yu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>XSXH Therapeutics Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>WuXi AppTec Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6a0cb469-aca1-4984-a870-e81c35790a6d","ControlNumber":"741","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>X.

The degradation of components provides materials for the synthesis of cellular components and, during tumor development, may provide energy. Therefore, autophagy regulation may have potential therapeutic uses in oncology. The triterpenoid saponin hederacolchiside A1 (HA1) has potent antitumor effects; however, its role in autophagy is still unknown.<br \/>Methods: In the present study, we used human colon cancer cells (SW480 and HT29) and mouse colon cancer cells (CT26) for the main experiments, and several additional cancer cell lines for other experiments. To assess the autophagy dysregulation caused by HA1, we evaluated the protein expressions of two autophagy markers (LC3 and SQSTM1) using Western blotting and the changes in organelles using LC3 puncta assay and transmission electron microscopy. We compared the effects of HA1 and other autophagy inhibitors. Additionally, we compared the HA1-induced decrease in cathepsin C (CTSC) expression in tumors and non-tumors using publicly available data. The effect of HA1 on tumor growth was evaluated <i>in vitro<\/i> using a three-dimensional spheroid model and patient-derived colon organoids, and <i>in vivo<\/i> based on tumor growth in a subcutaneous injection mouse model.<br \/>Results: HA1 treatment resulted in marked vacuolization of colon and other cancer cells. Additionally, autophagy was induced by the accumulation of LC3-II and SQSTM1. These findings were supported by increased LC3 puncta and abnormal organelle morphology. Compared to treatment with other autophagy inhibitors, HA1 treatment resulted in the formation of distinct vacuoles and increased LC3 and SQSTM1, similar to chloroquine treatment. The publicly available data showed that the lysosomal protease CTSC was increased in several cancers, including colon cancer, compared to the normal tissues. Furthermore, HA1 decreased the CTSC expression and enzymatic activity independently of the proteasome degradation, resulting in autophagy dysregulation and, subsequently, autophagy flux inhibition. HA1 inhibited cell growth and induced cell cycle arrest in the two-dimensional culture, three-dimensional spheroids, patient-derived colon cancer organoids, and the <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments.<br \/>Conclusion: HA1 inhibits cell growth and induces autophagy dysregulation.

Herein we evaluate VIP236 in patient-derived and metastatic models of cancer.<br \/>Methods: Subcutaneous patient-derived xenograft mouse models in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) were treated with VIP236. Metastasis formation was measured by human DNA PCR in an orthotopic TNBC mouse model. Gastric cancer models included patient-derived and cell line xenograft mouse models. Tumor\/control (T\/C) ratios were calculated, and body weight was measured. Pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of VIP236 in a gastric cancer SNU16 xenograft mouse model was investigated. Tumor samples from vehicle- and VIP236-treated groups collected up to 144 hours postdose were analyzed for % positive &#947;H2AX cells by a fit-for-purpose qualified immunohistochemistry assay.<br \/>Results: VIP236 is efficacious in vivo patient-derived models of NSCLC, RCC, CRC and TNBC with T\/C ratios of 0.0, 8.9,14.5 and 5.6 compared with vehicle control (p&#60;0.0001, CRC p&#60;0.01). VIP236 showed statistically improved in vivo efficacy in gastric cancer models versus trastuzumab deruxtecan (a commercial antibody-drug conjugate [ADC] with a camptothecin payload) in NCIH87 (HER2high, p&#60;0.05), SNU16 (HER2neg, p&#60;0.001), and GXA3040 (patient-derived, HER2low, p&#60;0.001) xenografts. VIP236 induced statistically significant tumor growth inhibition in a patient-derived CRC liver metastasis model (p&#60;0.01) and statistically significant reduction in lung (p&#60;0.001) and brain (p&#60;0.01) metastasis from an orthotopic TNBC model was observed. Across all in vivo models no clinically significant weight loss or treatment-related mortality were observed. Furthermore, a time-dependent increase of &#947;H2AX % positive cells in SNU16 in vivo VIP236-treated tumors confirms that VIP236 drives robust TOP1 inhibition and subsequent DNA damage.<br \/>Conclusions: In summary, VIP236 monotherapy efficacy in NSCLC, gastric, TNBC, RCC, CRC, and metastatic TNBC in vivo cancer models provides a rationale for clinical investigation in advanced metastatic solid tumors. In gastric cancer, VIP236 showed improved efficacy compared with the approved ADC, trastuzumab deruxtecan, regardless of HER2 expression. These results warrant further evaluation in clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug delivery,Topoisomerase I inhibitor,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Beatrix Stelte-Ludwig<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Melanie  M.

While primary treatment generally results in good local control, UMs spread systemically in approximately 50% of patients, most commonly to the liver. Patients who develop metastases are more likely to express the hypoxia-induced transcription factor HIF-1&#945; and the HIF-regulated genes CXCR4 and c-Met when compared to patients who do not develop metastatic disease<sup>1<\/sup>, suggesting that blocking HIF function might be clinically beneficial for the management of UM, a tumor type that fails to respond to treatments that are effective for treating cutaneous melanoma. 64B is a small molecule therapeutic that inhibits the function of hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) by disrupting the recruitment of the transcription co-factor paralogs, p300\/CBP, while leaving intact p300\/CBP&#8217;s ability to function with multiple other transcription factors. As a consequence, 64B is well tolerated and blocks transcription of multiple genes that help tumor cells survive and spread, including genes involved in angiogenesis, multidrug resistance, invasion and metastases. Using several different UM tumor cell lines implanted in the uveal tract of mice, we previously showed that 64B given systemically inhibits primary tumor growth and metastases<sup>1<\/sup>. We now compare the anti-cancer efficacy of 64B to two different tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that are in clinical testing for UM, sunitinib and selumetinib. Sunitinib is a TKI that suppresses the function of the growth factor receptors c-kit and VEGFR, proteins that are highly expressed in UM. Selumetinib is a highly selective MEK1\/2 inhibitor, targeting the MEK pathway that is activated in UM due to the GNAQ\/11 activation that occurs in about 85% of UMs. Human UM cells (92.1; GNAQ Q209P mutant) were implanted in the flank of nude mice, and systemic treatment (i.p.) with 64B was started once the s.c tumor reached 100 mm<sup>3<\/sup>. 64B was far superior to either sunitinib or selumetinib at causing a regression in tumor size and in reducing the number and size of liver metastases. The metastases that were observed in 64B-treated animals were very small and did not show evidence of tumor vascularization, unlike the control tumors which were much larger and were vascularized. The tumor-bearing animals receiving 64B were behaviorally normal and were healthier than control mice or mice receiving either sunitinib or selumetinib, some of which died in the non-64B groups. The efficacy of 64B at causing tumor regression and reducing metastases combined with its safety profile support advancing 64B to clinical testing for metastatic UM. <i><sup> 1 <\/sup>Dong L et al, Clin Cancer Res. 2019;25(7):2206-18.<\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hypoxia-inducible factor,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Metastasis,p300,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Hua Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Hans  E.

One such substrate is the kinase TBK1 which regulates activity of cGAS-STING and RIG-I nucleic acid sensing pathways. Up-regulation of PARP7 expression in cancers applies a brake to cytosolic nucleic acid sensing and the Type I interferon response. This creates an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) leading to faster tumor growth. In addition, inhibition of PARP7 has also been shown to directly arrest growth in a subset of cancer cells via the promotion of a senescence phenotype, inhibition of autophagy and regulation of metabolism. Through the use of structure-based drug design we describe the characterization of potent and selective inhibitors of PARP7. These molecules block viability of a subset of immortalized and primary cancer cells in 2D culture. We have observed potent cGAS-STING independent growth arrest in a number of cancer cell lines harboring a KRAS G12C mutation, and studies combining PARP7 inhibitors with commercially available KRAS G12C inhibitors yield additional in vitro efficacy. Recent studies have shown that inhibitors targeting oncogenic RAS pathway signaling can activate ULK1\/2-mediated autophagy as an adaptive treatment resistance mechanism. Hence, our data support further studies investigating the use of PARP7 inhibitors in KRAS-driven cancers either as single agents or in combination with mutant KRAS inhibitors. Our molecules also stimulate robust induction of type I interferon (IFN&#946;) and downstream chemokines such as CXCL10 in a cGAS-STING pathway dependent manner in a range of cancer cells and 3D organoids. This induction is augmented by combining agonists of cGAS-STING and RIG-I pathways with PARP7 inhibitors. In addition, PARP7 inhibitors work in concert with exogenous DNA-damaging agents such as chemotherapeutics and X-ray radiation to induce the type I interferon response in cancer cells. Overall, these data highlight the opportunity to utilize PARP7 inhibitors in cancers where high genomic instability leads to aberrant cytosolic nucleic acid levels or in concert with exogenous DNA-damaging agents. Our PARP7 inhibitors exhibit highly desirable physico-chemical and in vitro ADME properties coupled with an exceptional in vitro safety profile which translates to best-in-class rodent PK. In a KRAS G12C lung cancer xenograft model (NCI-H1373), twice daily oral administration of an exemplar PARP7 inhibitor drives rapid and full tumor regression in a dose-dependent manner. The anti-tumor effects correlate with robust tumor PK\/PD upon measurement of tumor IFN&#946; and CXCL10. In summary, we describe the characterization of a lead series of highly potent and selective PARP7 inhibitors which demonstrate excellent in vitro ADMET and in vivo PK properties leading to best-in-class anti-tumor efficacy in a KRAS-driven lung cancer xenograft model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP,Ras oncogene,Immuno-oncology,PARP inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Phillip  M.

Unfortunately, some patients do not benefit from most therapies and may even develop resistance to previously effective treatments leading to disease progression. Therefore, treatment resistance remains a significant challenge and new treatments are needed to overcome this problem.<br \/>ITI-1020 is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the phosphodiesterase 1 (PDE1) enzyme. Given the role of PDE1 in the regulation of essential cellular functions, including among others the transition of monocytes to macrophages and potentially the infiltration of macrophages into the tumor microenvironment (TME), we hypothesize that ITI-1020 will alter macrophage infiltration and polarization, as well as improve T cell function and recruitment into the TME, thereby promoting antitumor immunity in murine cancer models.<br \/>We tested this hypothesis by studying the effect of ITI-1020 given, alone or in combination a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, on tumor growth, and TME composition of E0771 and 4T1 tumor-bearing mice, two syngeneic models of TNBC.<br \/>Mice treated with ITI-1020 alone or in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody showed significant inhibition of tumor growth compared to isotype controls in both type of tumors. Flow cytometry analysis of the tumor microenvironment showed a significant shift in the polarization of macrophages toward a more inflammatory phenotype, and\/ or a reduction in the number of exhausted T cells. Furthermore, scRNAseq analysis of tumors from mice treated with ITI-1020 in monotherapy showed altered expression of genes involved in inflammatory processes and cell proliferation within the tumor microenvironment and in the cancer cells.<br \/>These results suggest that ITI-1020 promotes antitumor immunity by a novel mechanism (PDE1 inhibition), leading to tumor growth inhibition in E0771 and 4T1 tumor models. Translating these findings to the clinic may provide a new hope for the treatment of refractory or resistant TNBC tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Small molecule inhibitor,Antitumor activity,Anti-PD-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maud Voisin<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Aksinija  A.

As resistance to treatment is acquired and many patients relapse, new treatment strategies are needed. A model that strongly reflects the features of recurrent ovarian cancer in the peritoneal cavity is the \"cancer stem cells (CSCs),\" which are enriched when cells are cultured in three dimensions (3D) on low-attachment plates. The unique metabolic system of the \"3D CSCs \" is the subject of a novel therapeutic approach. Here, we show that ovarian cancer 3D CSCs have strong NAD<sup>+<\/sup> production capacity, which is particularly dependent on nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT), known as the rate-limiting enzyme in the salvage pathway of NAD<sup>+<\/sup> production. We found that NAMPT inhibition blocks NADPH and ATP production as well as NAD<sup>+<\/sup>, and subsequently suppresses the synthesis capacity of proteins, fat droplets, and cholesterol in the 3D ovarian cancer cells. In addition, we found that the combination of NAMPT inhibitor and the ALDH inhibitor disulfiram had a pronounced synergistic effect. This synergy inhibits oxidative phosphorylation and ALDH activity and promotes reactive oxygen species and apoptosis via caspase 3\/7 cleavage, which leads to death of the 3D cultured cells. Our results demonstrate that high NAMPT expression in ovarian cancer is likely to be a strong poor prognostic factor and that the combination of a NAMPT inhibitor and disulfiram could be a new treatment option to treat or prevent recurrent ovarian cancer. Our novel findings focus on NAMPT addiction as a property of ovarian cancer 3D CSCs, and strongly suggest the combined inhibition of NAMPT and ALDH as a potential therapeutic strategy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,3D cell culture,Metabolism,ATP,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kei Kudo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Brittney  S.

High expression has been associated with resistance to BCR\/PI3K inhibitors and gene mutations with reduced sensitivity to BTK inhibitors. We assessed whether its pharmacological inhibition with the potent CXCR4 inhibitor SPX5551 (POL5551) increases the antitumor activity of anti-lymphoma agents in lymphoma<i> <\/i>models, including some with secondary resistance to PI3K\/BTK inhibitors.<br \/>Methods: Antiproliferative activity was measured in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL, n=10), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL,2), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL, 2 + 4 derivatives with secondary resistance to PI3K and BTK inhibitors) cell lines exposed (72h) to increasing doses of compounds as single and in combination. Drugs included ibrutinib, copanlisib, idelalisib. The beneficial effect of the combinations versus the single agents was considered both as synergism (Chou-Talalay combination index), and as potency and efficacy (MuSyC algorithm). Mechanisms of action were studied by RNA-Seq, cell cycle and apoptosis assays, and immunofluorescence.<br \/>Results: Combination of SPX5551 with conventional or targeted therapies was beneficial, either additive or synergistic, across all tested lymphomas. The combination of SPX5551 and ibrutinib was superior to single treatments in MCL, MZL or CLL, with stronger benefit in MZL and MCL than CLL. SPX5551\/copanlisib showed synergism in both MCL and MZL, and SPX5551 addition overcame resistance in MZL with secondary resistance to idelalisib, copanlisib or ibrutinib. These results were confirmed using the clinically available drug candidate balixafortide (SPX6326, POL6326).RNA-Seq in the MCL REC1 model showed a much bigger impact of the SPX5551+ibrutinib on transcriptome than single agents: 2100 transcripts differentially expressed in the combination group vs DMSO (P&#60;0.01), 662 (ibrutinib), 260 (SPX5551). Downmodulated transcripts by the combination belonged to cytokine-mediated, TNF, NFkB, TLR, JAK-STAT pathways, MYC targets. Compared to single agents, the combo had a stronger downregulation of, among others, <i>TNF, EGR2\/3, CCL3\/4, CXCL10, CXCR3, CD83, DUSP2, BIRC3, MIR17HG,<\/i> <i>MYC<\/i>. Upregulated genes by SPX5551+ibrutinib involved apoptosis and p53. SPX5551 addition to ibrutinib further increased cells in subG0 phase and induced apoptosis compared to single agents. Consistent with changes observed by transcriptomic profiling, combination downmodulated pAKT, RELA and RELB protein levels compared to single treatments.<br \/>Conclusions: Results suggest that a combination with the CXCR4 inhibitor SPX5551 adds beneficial effect to BCR inhibitors and might overcome resistance to PI3K\/BTK inhibitors. Adding SPX551 to the treatment of patients with B cell lymphoma warrants further exploration.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,CXCR4,BTK,PI3K,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Laura Barnabei<sup>1<\/sup>, Alberto  J.

Loss of VHL can lead to hypoxia-inducible factor 2&#945; (HIF-2&#945;) accumulation and elevated expression of HIF target genes, such as VEGFA, many of which facilitate angiogenesis, proliferation, and metastasis of ccRCC. Therefore, inhibiting HIF-2&#945; has become a new strategy for the treatment of ccRCC. Here, we present the discovery of BPI-452080, a selective small molecule HIF-2&#945; inhibitor. In VHL defective ccRCC cell lines, BPI-452080 potently and selectively blocked the heterodimerization of HIF-2&#945; with HIF-1&#946;, but not that of HIF-1&#945; with HIF-1&#946;. It inhibited the downstream hypoxia-responsive gene transcription and VEGFA protein secretion. In multiple xenograft mouse models, oral administration of BPI-452080 significantly inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner. BPI-452080 demonstrated good PK\/PD correlation in the 786-O xenograft model after a single dosing, as shown by a concentration-dependent inhibition of VEGFA secretion in plasma and a reduction of the mRNA levels of VEGFA, CXCR4, CCND1, and GLUT1 genes in tumor tissue. Moreover, BPI-452080 exhibited good bioavailability in multiple pre-clinical species, favorable ADME properties, and good tolerance in toxicology studies. In conclusion, BPI-452080 is a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable HIF-2&#945; inhibitor which presents a novel therapeutic option for ccRCC, von Hippel-Lindau disease, and other solid tumors. BPI-452080 is planned to enter Phase I clinical trial in China in early 2023.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Renal cell carcinoma,Hypoxia-inducible factor,Cancer,Kidney cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Pingping Wang<sup><\/sup>, Rongwen Yang<sup><\/sup>, Yun Sun<sup><\/sup>, Xuepeng Ju<sup><\/sup>, Jiayu Zhao<sup><\/sup>, Yanju Liu<sup><\/sup>, Xiaoyun Liu<sup><\/sup>, Zhengyao Zou<sup><\/sup>, Jialin Ren<sup><\/sup>, Min Wang<sup><\/sup>, Haibo Chen<sup><\/sup>, Xuegang Yi<sup><\/sup>, Jian Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Teng Ma<sup><\/sup>, Gaoliang Cheng<sup><\/sup>, Lijia Liu<sup><\/sup>, Jing Guo<sup><\/sup>, Xiangyong Liu<sup><\/sup>, Hong Lan<sup><\/sup>, Lieming Ding<sup><\/sup>, <b>Jiabing Wang<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Betta Pharmaceuticals Co.,Ltd, Hangzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"94f59148-2c21-4b01-9887-0df265274004","ControlNumber":"3228","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

IDH1 or IDH2 mutations are observed in more than 80% of low- to mid-grade gliomas and in ~20% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Tumor-related IDH1\/2 mutants acquire a novel function of using &#945;-KG as a substrate to produce R-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). 2-HG is an oncogenic metabolite, and reducing it by inhibiting mutant IDH1 or IDH2 has been shown to be an effective treatment approach. Although agents targeting IDH1 or IDH2 have been approved to treat IDH-mutant cancers, existing IDH1 inhibitors do not cross the blood-brain barrier, a feature needed for treating glioma. Furthermore, resistant mutations do occur, including cross-isoform mutations, which call for the development of dual IDH1\/2 inhibitors with good brain penetration. However, IDH1\/2 dual inhibitors are rarely discovered. Here we report the discovery of BPI-221351, a potent inhibitor of mutant IDH1 and mutant IDH2. BPI-221351 shows excellent inhibitory activities against both IDH1 and IDH2 enzymes, and potently suppresses 2-HG levels in tumor cells harboring IDH1 or IDH2 mutants. In an IDH-mutant xenograft model, BPI-221351 reduced 2-HG to baseline level up to 24 h after a single oral dose administration. In addition, BPI-221351 possesses excellent blood-brain-barrier penetration with a higher drug concentration in the brain than that in plasma. In conclusion, BPI-221351 exhibits strong activity towards both IDH1 and IDH2 mutants <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> with favorable pharmacological properties, presenting a new therapeutic opportunity for treating glioma and other relevant cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioma,IDH1,Acute myeloid leukemia,Brain tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Hongling Shen<sup><\/sup>, Xiaofeng Xu<sup><\/sup>, Yabin Li<sup><\/sup>, Xizhen Song<sup><\/sup>, Jie Chen<sup><\/sup>, Yunting Bi<sup><\/sup>, Jing Guo<sup><\/sup>, Tong Xu<sup><\/sup>, Huijuan Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Lijia Liu<sup><\/sup>, Zhengyao Zou<sup><\/sup>, Jialin Ren<sup><\/sup>, Jun Tong<sup><\/sup>, Xiaoyun Liu<sup><\/sup>, Hongfei Rong<sup><\/sup>, Teng Ma<sup><\/sup>, Chao Wang<sup><\/sup>, Xiangyong Liu<sup><\/sup>, Hong Chen<sup><\/sup>, Jiayu Zhao<sup><\/sup>, Xuepeng Ju<sup><\/sup>, Haibo Chen<sup><\/sup>, Haidi Shen<sup><\/sup>, Hong Lan<sup><\/sup>, Lieming Ding<sup><\/sup>, <b>Jiabing Wang<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Betta Pharmaceuticals Co.,Ltd, Hangzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7e40538e-d7db-4e08-835f-7c83e92fa794","ControlNumber":"3182","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

However, MM is still considered incurable, and almost all MM patients eventually experience relapse. Relapsed\/refractory MM (rrMM) remains a disease with an unmet need for additional therapeutic options, especially drugs with a novel mechanism of action. CD73 is a cell surface enzyme which is highly expressed in the tumor microenvironment. CD73, in concert with CD39, converts ATP to adenosine, which promotes the onset and progression of cancer via inhibiting T cells, NK cells, and DCs, inducing immunosuppressive cell types and enhancing their functions (Gao <i>et al., <\/i>2014). Indeed, elevated levels of adenosine have been observed in various cancers, including MM (Ray A <i>et al., <\/i>2022). ATG-037 is a highly potent and selective oral small molecule inhibitor of CD73. In this study, we evaluated the potential of ATG-037 in treating multiple myeloma.<br \/>Methods: The inhibition of enzyme function of recombinant and cell surface CD73 was evaluated by measuring the concentration of inorganic phosphate using Malachite Green. Reversal of AMP\/adenosine-mediated human T cell suppression by CD73 inhibitors was determined in the presence of exogenous AMP. The <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy was assessed in syngeneic myeloma models, J558 and MCP-11. The murine myeloma cells were implanted subcutaneously into BALB\/c mice, and ATG-037 (100 mg\/kg) or vehicle was orally administered BID starting day one post-implantation.<br \/>Results: ATG-037 demonstrated complete inhibition of CD73 activity without &#8220;hook effect&#8221;, whereas MEDI9447, a CD73 antibody, did not reach 100% inhibition and with reduced inhibition of CD73 activity at higher antibody concentrations. T cell proliferation and activation induced by CD3\/CD28 activator were suppressed by extracellular 20 &#956;M or 100 &#956;M AMP, and the suppression was relieved by the addition of ATG-037. Furthermore, compared to the vehicle control, ATG-037 at 100 mg\/kg exhibited significant tumor growth inhibition with a tumor growth inhibition (TGI) value of 30.88% on Day 16 after implantation in J558 model. ATG-037 (100 mg\/kg) also demonstrated significant <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor efficacy against MCP-11 myeloma compared with the vehicle control group, with a TGI value of 24.27% on Day 17 after implantation. ATG-037 treatment was well tolerated, with no significant body weight loss or severe adverse effects observed in both models.<br \/>Conclusion: ATG-037 demonstrated potent and complete CD73 enzyme inhibition without &#8220;hook effect&#8221;, restoring T cell functions from AMP-mediated suppression. And this is the first report that a CD73 inhibitor demonstrates <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy in myeloma animal models. The single agent anti-myeloma efficacy of ATG-037 warrants further clinical investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD73,Multiple myeloma,Adenosine,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Gang Bian<sup>1<\/sup>, Jiahui Hua<sup>1<\/sup>, Ge Lin<sup>1<\/sup>, Yu Bai<sup>2<\/sup>, Tianci Zhu<sup>2<\/sup>, Bin Jiang<sup>3<\/sup>, Jay Mei<sup>4<\/sup>, Bo Shan<sup>4<\/sup>, <b>Bing Hou<\/b><sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Shanghai Antengene Corporation Limited, Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Antengene (Hangzhou) Biologics Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Antengene Biotech LLC, Doylestown, PA,<sup>4<\/sup>Antengene Corporation Co., Ltd, Shaoxing, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c62678c0-279c-4143-b9f0-85292e708637","ControlNumber":"3186","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;G.

Current drug treatments, including chemo-\/target therapies (<i>e.g<\/i>., sorafenib), are usually ineffective among advanced HCC and with high toxicity. ARK5, or NUAK1, a novel AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) family member 5, is found overexpressed in many malignancies including HCC and usually associated with poor prognosis, as well as drug resistance. For example<i>,<\/i> doxorubicin, first-line chemotherapy for TACE, and transarterial chemoembolization for advanced HCC. In addition, ARK5 is found to be vitally involved in oncoprotein Myc-driven oncogenesis (metabolic homeostasis\/cell survival), particularly in tumors under nutrition\/oxygen-deprivations, including HCC. HX301 is a clinical stage first-in-class (FIC) ARK5 inhibitor (ARK5i) and other kinase activities (<i>e.g.,<\/i> CDK4\/6, CSF1R, <i>etc<\/i>.). In this study we evaluate HX301 antitumor activity in HCC over-expressing both ARK5 and c-Myc.<br \/>Methods: A panel of subcutaneous HCC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) were genomically profiled by whole transcriptome sequencing by RNAseq, and several selected models with different expression of ARK5 and c-myc expression were assessed pharmacologically using daily dosing of 100mg\/kg HX301. Subcutaneous tumor responses to HX301 were calculated by tumor growth inhibition (TGI).<br \/>Results: HCC PDX models LI1035, LI6610 both had high expression of ARK5 and Myc genes, whereas LI6650 had lower expression level of Myc than LI1035 and LI6610. LI6652 had lower expression level of ARK5 than LI1035 and LI6610. The log<sub>2<\/sub> FPKM values of ARK5 and Myc in model of LI1035 was 3.9284 and 4.8177, 3.6629 and 5.3658 for LI6610, 3.1228 and -0.0556 for LI6650, -0.3538 and 6.5785 for LI6652. The TGI for LI1035 and LI6610 was 64% (P = 0.0293) and 62% (P = 0.0257) respectively whereas in comparison a smaller TGI of 44% (P = 0.034) was observed in LI6650. In the model of LI6652, TGI for HX301 was 58%, but a statistically significant difference was not observed when comparing the treatment group with the vehicle group (P = 0.138).<br \/>Conclusions: Our preliminary results demonstrate that HX301 had strong antitumor activity in HCC PDX models expressing both ARK5 and c-Myc. HX301 has the potential to be a first-in-class ARK5i candidate for the treatment of advanced HCC with high expression of c-Myc, warranting further clinical investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,ARK5,PDX,c-Myc,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zhihua Jiao<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jingjing Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Hang Ke<sup>2<\/sup>, Faming Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Henry Li<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Crown Bioscience, Inc., San Diego, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Hanx Biopharmaceuticals Inc., Oceanside, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6135dcf1-faca-489d-b649-d5412311fc7c","ControlNumber":"3235","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Z.

Three groups of cell lines with various HPV\/p53 genotypes (p53-wt\/HPV-; p53-mutated\/HPV-, and p53-wt\/HPV+) were treated by peposertib, 4Gy IR, or a combination of both. In addition to viability and cell cycle assays, caspase 3 activity and senescence-associated &#946;-galactosidase (&#946;-gal) assays were used to evaluate cell fates such as apoptosis and senescence. yH2AX and RAD51 foci immunostainings were implemented to assess the levels of DNA damage and repair. NMRI-nu mice with subcutaneous xenografts of p53-wt\/HPV+ and p53-wt\/HPV- cell lines were treated with either fractionated 10Gy IR (via the small animal radiation therapy system SmART) alone or in combination with orally distributed peposertib for five consecutive days. Tumors were collected at the end of experiment and the immunostaining targeting Ki67, nuclear DNA fragmentation (TUNEL staining of apoptosis) and &#946;-gal (senescence) was performed. Decreased number of viable cells after IR alone and particularly after combined treatment was observed in most cell lines. Inhibition of NHEJ combined with IR induces an abrogation of proliferation with different cell fates. Whereas HPV+ and p53-mutated cells undergo apoptosis due to a common alteration in the p53 pathways, p53-wt cells are preferentially eliminated through senescence. Elevated yH2AX foci formation after 24h and 48h in the combination treatment group indicates unresolved persistent DNA damage. In vivo, significant effects of IR and of the combination treatment on tumor growth control was observed in p53-wt\/HPV+ but not in p53-wt\/HPV- xenografts where the tumors relapsed towards end of follow-up. High level of proliferative and apoptotic cells and low level of senescent cells detected in HPV+ compared to HPV- may potentially determine a better treatment response in HPV+ tumors. Diverse pattern of viability and cell cycle distribution upon treatment with IR or combination in cells with dysfunctional p53 compared to cells with p53-wt confirmed the outcome dependence on p53 and HPV status. Peposertib radiosensitizes HNSCC tumors and leads to a better treatment response in dysfunctional p53 cells both in-vitro and in-vivo. Determination of the HPV and p53 status in a particular tumor might be necessary to effectively shape the intervention outcome when combining NHEJ targeting with radiation therapy.
