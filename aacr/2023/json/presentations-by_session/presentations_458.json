[{"Abstract":"Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is widely used for cancer diagnostic and therapeutic applications in clinical practice and clinical trials. Currently, the Truseq PCR-free library preparation methods are routinely used in genomics laboratories. However, microgram amounts of DNA input is a limitation due to limited materials often from clinically-derived specimens. Here, we evaluated a novel low input (100-300 ng) PCR-free tagmentation (TAG) based library preparation for WGS. Replicates of TAG- and ligation-based (Illumina TruSeq) sequencing libraries were prepared from 3 pairs of breast cancer-derived tumors (HCC1195, HCC1143 and HCC1187) and matched B-lymphocyte-derived normal (HCC1195BL, HCC1143BL and HCC1187BL) cell lines. Libraries were sequenced on Illumina Novaseq 6000 platforms to target 30x and 90x mean coverage for normal and tumor samples respectively. Raw sequencing data were aligned to the hg38 by Isaac Aligner before variant analysis by Strelka2.&nbsp; Technical sequencing metrics demonstrated high similarity between TAG- and ligation-based workflows, including passing filter reads, Q30%, aligned reads, mean coverage. Germline variants of HCC1395BL showed greater than 98% precision and sensitivity using ligation-based variants as a reference. For somatic mutation calling from TAG-based libraries, HCC1395, HCC1143 and HCC1187, 88%, 85% and 86% precision and 81%, 70%, 68% sensitivity was observed, respectively, compared to the ligation-based method. Furthermore, using the SEQC2 Consortium high-confidence mutation set, TAG- and ligation- based variant calls of HCC1395 had 90% and 93% precision and 74% and 73% sensitivity, respectively with this high confidence reference. Further investigation showed that a high fraction of false negative calls was associated with low variant allele frequency (&#60;10%). Compared to an available reference dataset for benchmarking somatic calling pipelines from New York Genome Center, TAG- and ligation-based variant calls of HCC1143 yielded 85% and 83% precision and 63% and 63% sensitivity, respectively; TAG- and ligation-based variant calls of HCC1187 resulted in 91% and 92% precision and 81% and 79% sensitivity, respectively.&nbsp; In summary, the low input TAG-based WGS protocol produced highly reproducible variant calls with highly concordant somatic variant calls compared to the commonly-used PCR-free ligation-based methods and to reference callset. Further evaluation is warranted to broaden clinical application from minimal starting material.The views expressed in this abstract are solely of the authors and do not reflect the official policy of the Departments of Army\/Navy\/Air Force, Department of Defense, USUHS, HJF, or U.S. Government.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Whole genome sequencing,Cancer genomics,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Liqun Jiang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Xijun Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Camille Alba<sup>1<\/sup>, Gauthaman Sukumar<sup>1<\/sup>, Elizabeth  A.

Here, we sought to detect and profile molecular evidence of disease in nearby brain tissue absent of tumor by standard-of-care clinical imaging.<br \/>Methods: Twenty-two patients presenting to the University of Utah with radiographic evidence of a new high- to low-grade intrinsic brain tumor were enrolled after providing written informed consent. Using intraoperative stereotactic guidance, tissue was acquired from bulky tumor (36 samples) and beyond the surgical margins in peritumoral edema (29 samples). All samples underwent somatic mutation discovery using a custom-designed 114 kb panel (115 genes) and True2 duplex sequencing. True2 is a duplex adapter-based technology developed and empirically validated to achieve &#62;95% sensitivity for an allele frequency &#8805;0.1% at a false positive rate of &#60;1 per 100 kb panel positions.<br \/>Results: Somatic mutations were detected in all samples regardless of radiographic location. The mean number of mutations was similar between bulky tumor and peritumoral edema (5.6&#177;2.4 vs. 5.1&#177;2.9 mutations\/sample, respectively; <i>P<\/i>=0.48). Although the mean allele frequency of variants was higher in tumor compared to edema (16.0&#177;21.2% vs. 11.2&#177;17.4%, respectively; <i>P<\/i>=0.017), there was a strong overlap in the allele frequency ranges (tumor: 0.07% to 90.3% vs. edema: 0.10% to 75.6%). Notably, one-third of all the somatic mutations detected had an allele frequency &#60;0.5%. Common diagnostic mutations specific to each tumor type were present in both tumor and edema - <i>TERT<\/i> promoter mutations in glioblastoma and oligodendroglioma; <i>IDH1<\/i>\/<i>2<\/i> mutations in astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma. In edema, mutations associated with glioblastoma but unique to a single sample occurred in <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>EGFR<\/i>, <i>PTEN<\/i>, <i>NF1<\/i>, <i>ATRX<\/i>, <i>SCN9A<\/i>, and <i>MTOR<\/i> at an allele frequency ranging from 0.10% to 20.22%. The edema of astrocytomas similarly harbored unique mutations in <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>PTEN<\/i>, and <i>NF1<\/i>, but mutations in <i>EGFR<\/i>, <i>ATRX<\/i>, <i>SCN9A<\/i>, and <i>MTOR<\/i> were absent. In contrast to both glioblastoma and astrocytoma, oligodendrogliomas exhibited a diverse collection of unique <i>CIC<\/i> and <i>PAFAH1B3<\/i> mutations in edema at an allele frequency between 0.13% and 3.63%.<br \/>Conclusions: The application of True2 technology to conduct a discovery search for very-low frequency somatic mutations found the molecular burden between tumor and adjacent edema to be remarkably similar. Our findings indicate an extensive tumor presence beyond the surgical margins in diffuse gliomas with unique and abundant somatic mutations that may form the foundation of recurrent lesions. Molecular analysis of adjacent tissue identified as radiographically unaffected by bulky tumor to better characterize the mutational landscape of migratory subclones may directly impact personalized medicine for high- and low-grade diffuse glioma patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioma,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hunter Underhill<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Karsy<sup>1<\/sup>, Christian Davidson<sup>1<\/sup>, Sabine Hellwig<sup>2<\/sup>, Samuel Stevenson<sup>1<\/sup>, Sydney Vincenti<sup>1<\/sup>, Charlie Dean<sup>1<\/sup>, Brion Harrison<sup>1<\/sup>, Eric Goold<sup>1<\/sup>, Mary Bronner<sup>1<\/sup>, Howard Colman<sup>1<\/sup>, Randy Jensen<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT,<sup>2<\/sup>ARUP Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"04c338b5-c8dd-4120-9c55-cbb8ca7ef955","ControlNumber":"1730","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;H.

Studying evolution and resistance requires large cohorts of patients; for each patient, a comprehensive phylogenetic tree is used to follow clones over time and space. Deep whole-genome sequencing (WGS) enables the creation of more robust phylogenies, since (i) each clone is characterized by far more clone-specific mutations (compared to whole-exome or panel sequencing); and (ii) WGS yields more accurate clonal and sub-clonal allelic copy-number estimates, enabling more precise estimation of the fraction of cancer cells that harbor each mutation.<br \/>Due to recent development of more affordable WGS by Ultima Genomics, we set out to test our ability to construct phylogenetic trees based on Ultima WGS. Ultima sequencing has demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for detecting germline polymorphisms, but its performance on somatic mutation calling has not yet been rigorously studied.<br \/>First, we adjusted our somatic mutation detection pipeline to work with Ultima-generated WGS data and tested its performance using well-studied cell line tumor\/normal pairs. We assembled a ground truth set of somatic mutations based on deep sequencing data from multiple platforms for the breast cancer cell line pairs (HCC1954\/HCC1954-BL and HCC1143\/HCC1143-BL) and the melanoma tumor\/normal cell line pair (COLO829\/COLO829-BL). We found that mutation detection performance was on-par with other platforms for single nucleotide variations.<br \/>Next, we identified 32 patients from various cancer types (breast, lung, cholangiocarcinoma, and melanoma) treated with a variety of therapies. We collected between 4 to 14 samples per patient at autopsy (total of 303), and sequenced them with Ultima to an average coverage of 63x (range 48x-91x). We identified mutations using our Ultima-adjusted WGS pipeline and constructed phylogenetic trees using our PhylogicNDT suite of tools. We then compared the results to trees previously constructed from mostly whole-exomes (and a few whole-genomes) sequenced on Illumina. We demonstrate that the trees generated from Ultima WGS data are consistent with the previously generated trees, and proved to be much more detailed.<br \/>At commercialization, we anticipate that WGS for projects like this will be performed at ~1\/6th the cost of current NGS offerings (on par with current WES costs). Therefore, it will enable larger studies and more accurate phylogenetic reconstruction, which will advance the study of tumor evolution and resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Sequencing,Clonal evolution,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Julian Hess<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Elizabeth Martin<sup>1<\/sup>, Ilya Soifer<sup>2<\/sup>, Hila Benjamin<sup>2<\/sup>, Mendy Miller<sup>1<\/sup>, Carrie Cibulskis<sup>1<\/sup>, Brian  P.

OS is archetypal of cancers driven by aneuploidy and structural rearrangement rather than point mutations. These structural variants (SVs) can alter gene expression stoichiometrically, but the functional consequences of many SVs stem from their effect on multidimensional genome organization. SVs can enable enhancer hijacking, alter boundaries of topologically associated domains (TADs), and move gene loci to different regulatory compartments affecting transcription. SVs can also form extrachromosomal DNA amplicons (ecDNA), which can be megabases in size and can incorporate both genes and regulatory elements to result in substantial increases in gene transcription and intratumor heterogeneity. Complex SVs may have profound implications for prognosis and treatment in OS and other cancers. By incorporating long-read optical genome mapping (OGM) and chromatin conformation capture sequencing (HiC), our goal is to detect complex tumor-specific SVs that will inform and refine pediatric OS subtypes, revealing new tumor-specific chemotherapy treatment options.<br \/>We have generated a unique panel of 11 OS patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cell lines which have been previously characterized regarding response to targeted therapies using whole genome (WGS), RNA (RNA-seq), and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) sequencing. To understand the complex genomic reorganization that occurs in OS, we have integrated OGM and WGS data for six cell lines, and OGM, WGS, and HiC data for two. SVs were detected using OGM, HiC, and WGS modalities, and we observed 59-61% concordance between SVs called using OGM and HiC, versus 22-45% when comparing with WGS calls. PDX lines assayed using OGM exhibit between 5,135 and 7,514 SVs each, and translocation numbers ranged from 212 to 1,422. These lines exhibit between dozens of potential ecDNA amplicons, including one amplicon which may explain that line&#8217;s specific and exceptionally high expression of YAP1 and BIRC2 transcripts. HiC interaction maps for two PDX lines reveal genomic compartments and TAD boundaries in detail, with 3,713 unique TAD boundaries identified between them using 50kb genomic bins. We observe that 60% of these boundaries are consistent between these lines, and 27% exhibit differences that suggest boundary loss or gain. These changing boundaries are associated with numerous SVs and\/or copy number discrepancies, and with genomic regions containing genes with dysregulated RNA transcript levels. Incorporating OGM and HiC modalities adds substantially to our ability to detect oncogenic SVs and the genes they affect.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,DNA copy number,Translocation,Aneuploidy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Andrew  S.

The chemical and physical modifications of nucleic acids introduced during fixation, storage and purification negatively impact molecular profiling and vary from sample-to-sample. Conventional sonication and ligation-based library preparation is considered the gold-standard approach for FFPE samples, but it is time-consuming and expensive. Importantly, these processes introduce artifacts that impact downstream analysis and interpretation (Haile et al., 2019).<br \/>We have developed a novel fragmentation chemistry that virtually eliminates hairpin artifacts, achieving levels on par with non-FFPE control samples. Our fragmentation method is highly scalable, exhibits minimal sequence bias, and reduces cost and workflow inefficiencies associated with mechanical shearing. In this study, we developed a unified method for library preparation from FFPE samples which produces similar insert sizes across variable input mass and quality of FFPE samples. We carefully evaluated the performance of this method relative to a sonication-based approach employing the KAPA HyperPrep kit. Libraries were constructed from 50 to 200 ng of FFPE DNA, inputs typically used for NGS, ranging from low-to high-quality as assessed using a qPCR-based method and DNA integrity (DIN). Targeted sequencing was performed using a 37 kb custom oncology hybridization capture panel to investigate molecular complexity.<br \/>Our workflow virtually eliminated hairpin artifacts that were present in up to 4.5% of reads in sonication-based libraries. Soft-clipping was also 3- to 7-fold lower in libraries prepared with the Watchmaker kit relative to sonicated DNA libraries, improving overall sequencing economy. Furthermore, the mean target coverage achieved with the Watchmaker kit was comparable to or higher than sonication libraries using the same input mass. Because input masses were normalized post-shearing, which typically results in 20-40% sample loss, coverage with our approach is significantly higher relative to sonication, if normalizing to pre-sheared DNA input.<br \/>Watchmaker DNA Library Preparation with Fragmentation enables high-quality DNA library preparation from damaged FFPE samples, producing high target coverage, uniform insert size, and minimizing sequencing artifacts to improve sensitivity and specificity. This approach is highly scalable and automatable, enabling various oncology applications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS),FFPE,Sequencing,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Giulia Corbet<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Philip Benson<sup>1<\/sup>, Kailee Reed<sup>1<\/sup>, Skyler Mishkin<sup>1<\/sup>, Thomas Harrison<sup>1<\/sup>, Kristin Scott<sup>2<\/sup>, Zane Jaafar<sup>1<\/sup>, Kristina Giorda<sup>1<\/sup>, Josh Haimes<sup>1<\/sup>, Martin Ranik<sup>1<\/sup>, Brian Kudlow<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Watchmaker Genomics, Inc., Boulder, CO,<sup>2<\/sup>Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"50bb0f2a-1c30-447d-a4e8-09d6c8e92437","ControlNumber":"6566","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>G.

Most archived tissues are formalin-fixed, and paraffin-embedded (FFPE), making them inaccessible to the modern technology for characterization. Recently, 10x Genomics release a new reagent enabling single-cell fixed RNA characterization from fixed samples. The initial release is for fresh samples being fixed and then profiled later. However, FFPE archived tissues are not supported yet. We showed here two protocols to dissociate single cells and single nuclei from a 10-year-old FFPE human gastric tumor. We then profile them with 10x Genomics&#8217; fixed RNA profiling kit. We further compare the data with the 10x Genomics&#8217; Visium data obtained from the same tissues to understand the performance of these two protocols.

In particular, healthy individuals carry large numbers of cells and clonal expansions with mutations in driver genes commonly observed in cancer. We previously demonstrated that the majority of epithelial cells in the proximal airway accumulate DNA damage proportionally to an individual's smoking habits. However, the analysis of whole genomes indicated the abundance of a population of cells with a near-normal mutation burden, mirroring cellular populations found in never-smoking individuals. In contrast to the proximal airway, the genomics of cells in the distal airway of healthy individuals with diverse smoking histories, and thus the foundation of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), has not been investigated yet. To assess the influence of smoking on the distal airway and to compare the genomics of proximal and distal airway in the lung, we established an experimental procedure to create single-cell derived alveolar type II (AT2) organoids from primary human tissue of 9 patients. In particular, we focus on AT2 cells, given their hypothesised role as a potential cell of origin for LUAD.<br \/>Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of &#62;400 organoids was utilised to assess the landscape of somatic variation, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions and deletions (indels), copy number and structural variation (CNVs, SVs). Focusing on SNVs, we found that the mutation burden of never-smokers is significantly lower compared to ex- and current-smokers. Emphasising the effect of tobacco smoking on the distal airway, this difference was driven by the presence of mutations related to SBS4 and SBS92, mutational signatures associated with tobacco smoking. Interestingly, and in contrast to the proximal airway, we did not find a difference in the mutation burden of ex- and current-smokers, suggesting that smoking damage to alveolar cells is more severe and long-term. Lastly, to characterise the driver mutation landscape in depth, we used targeted single-molecule sequencing of 250 known cancer genes to profile 15 AT2 single-cell suspensions as well as 22 frozen parenchyma biopsies. To date, our preliminary results indicate positive selection on lineage defining mutations including SFTPB and SFTPC, coding for surfactant as well as TP53. As we begin to explore these data further, we expect this work to provide unprecedented insights into the contribution of somatic and driver mutations to the earliest stages of lung cancer development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Somatic mutations,Cancer initiating cells,Organoids,Cancer genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Moritz Jakob Przybilla<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Amany Ammar<sup>2<\/sup>, Ryan Chuen Khaw<sup>2<\/sup>, Andrew  R.

Most tests screen either DNA or RNA to provide a piece of a complex molecular puzzle, resulting in higher cost, processing time and amounts of input material. We report a single tube NGS assay that uses total nucleic acid as input for simultaneous screening of DNA and RNA (allowing us to profile gene expression, fusions and multiple variants), establishing a work frame for comprehensive molecular profiling in a single test.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> 243 clinical ALL samples (206 bone marrow and 37 peripheral blood) were used in this study, split in to two cohorts, 102 for initial investigation and 141 for reproducibility testing.

Data were analyzed by in-house bioinformatic pipeline. Expression values were normalized to <i>GUSB<\/i>. Previous in-house studies were used to establish cut-offs for upregulation of 31 genes associated with ALL.

Principal component analysis (PCA) on the 229 RNA targets was used to identify clusters.

Pathway enrichment on the OE genes suggest that the medium cluster is enriched for genes linked with missregulation of transcription, and the high cluster shows enrichment of kinase activation. We then repeated the analysis with a second set of 141 samples, to assess the reproducibility of these findings and confirming our results. Finally, we investigated SNVs&#8217; role in our data.

Here we evaluate the utility of the novel Singular Genomics G4 sequencing platform for cancer research applications by performing whole exome sequencing (WGS) of the human reference control HG001. We further demonstrate performance for methyl-seq, bulk RNA-seq, and scRNA-seq.<br \/>Methods: To assess performance, we prepared a human whole exome library (IDT xGen Exome) from HG001 gDNA, then sequenced the library via the G4 sequencing platform with F2 flowcells (150M read throughput) to yield 483M 2x150bp reads. Sequence quality and mapping metrics were obtained via GATK4 after read alignment to Grch38 via bwa mem. Germline variants were identified via DeepVariant v1.4 using the Illumina WES model, implemented via Parabricks; performance was assessed by hap.py. Methyl-seq performance was examined by methylDackel analysis of an EM-Seq library (NEB) prepared from 50ng HG001 gDNA and sequencing to 20x coverage via 2x150bp reads. Bulk RNA-seq performance was assessed by replicate sequencing of UHR total RNA on the G4 and Illumina NextSeq platforms. Single cell RNA-seq libraries were prepared from healthy donor PBMC via the 10x Chromium, sequenced on the G4 and Illumina NovaSeq, then analyzed via Cell Ranger, Scanpy and scvi-tools.<br \/>Results: Exome sequencing of HG001 yielded high quality data (single pass accuracy &#62; 99.7% for R1 and R2) with even coverage of the genome (fold 80 =1.42). hap.py analysis of DeepVariant calls yielded a SNP and Indel F1 of 99.06 and 96.05%, respectively, over high confidence regions. Performance was high over challenging features such as low complexity DNA and GC rich regions. EM-Seq analysis revealed global distributions of cytosine methylation that closely matched public EM-Seq data derived from the Illumina NovaSeq. Bulk RNA-seq transcript counts were highly correlated across technical replicates (R2 = .990) and platforms (R2= .988). Pseudo-bulk analysis of scRNA-seq libraries showed high cross-platform correlation (R2= .982), with nearly identical CellTypist annotations (Adjusted Rand Index = .999).<br \/>Conclusions: The G4 sequencer delivers sequencing data on par with the state-of-the-art in NGS, but with a faster turnaround than traditional SBS systems. Notably, we observe a high concordance with the leading NGS platform for human DNA variant detection, methyl-seq, bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-Seq. We anticipate the rapid turnaround and flexible throughput of the G4 will have broad utility for basic and translational cancer research applications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sequencing,Genomics,Methylation,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Kenneth Gouin<sup><\/sup>, Liz LaMarca<sup><\/sup>, Yu Xiang<sup><\/sup>, Anne Decker<sup><\/sup>, Sabrina Shore<sup><\/sup>, Ryan Shultzaberger<sup><\/sup>, Daan Witters<sup><\/sup>, <b>Timothy Looney<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Martin  M.

Studies about the function of SVs in tumor biology and their putative application as biomarkers are currently hampered by the need for fresh frozen tumor material to detect SVs by long-read or deep whole genome sequencing. This impedes the identification of SVs in retrospective cohorts and implementation in routine diagnostics (where only formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue is available). In this study, we explored the applicability of FFPE-Targeted Locus Capture (FFPE-TLC) as a novel technology for targeted detection of SVs in CRC.<br \/><b>Materials and methods:<\/b> We defined the regions most frequently presenting SVs in CRC and included these in a customized capture panel. FFPE-TLC followed by targeted sequencing was performed on primary tumors of 29 metastatic CRC patients and eight patient-matched normal colon tissues. SV-specific droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assays were designed for orthogonal validation of SVs in tumor tissue and detection of SVs in cell-free plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The regions associated with most SVs in metastatic CRC were four common fragile site (CFS) genes; <i>MACROD2<\/i>, <i>PARK2<\/i>, <i>FHIT<\/i>, <i>WWOX, <\/i>and three LINE source elements, and were included in a 2.7 Mb targeted panel. After filtering for germline variation, we identified 168 somatic SVs in 26\/29 patients (90%), median SVs per patient: 3, range: 1-22. 110 SVs were found in CFS genes in 19\/29 patients (66%), 12 of them presenting SVs in MACROD2. 58 SVs were caused by LINE integrations in 19\/29 patients (66%), with different LINE behaviors observed: one source LINE generated 19 SVs in 13 patients, whilst another LINE caused 33 SVs in 5 patients. For selected cases, the tumor-specific origin of SVs was verified and its applicability as a plasma ctDNA biomarker demonstrated.<br \/><b>Discussion:<\/b> This study demonstrates, for the first time, the feasibility of targeted detection of SVs in CFS genes and SVs caused by LINE retrotransposition in routinely obtained FFPE tissue without prior knowledge of the breakpoint location. The high prevalence of SVs offers opportunities to detect many somatic alterations by targeting few genes and LINEs, e.g. for translation into ctDNA biomarker assays. We conclude that FFPE-TLC enables the investigation of SV mutations in retrospective cohorts and opens new avenues for mutation analysis in routine diagnostics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Biomarkers,Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE),ctDNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Carmen Rubio-Alarcon<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ellen Stelloo<sup>2<\/sup>, Daan  C.

A clinically molecular classifier called ProMisE (Proactive Molecular Risk Classifier for Endometrial Cancer) was developed based on the TCGA classification. p53abn EC is the most aggressive of the four ProMisE prognostic molecular subtypes, responsible for 50-70% of EC mortality. Therapeutic advances are urgently needed to improve outcomes for these patients. This research focuses on determining the significance of <i>HER2<\/i> and <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplifications in p53abn EC to identify therapeutic opportunities for this aggressive cancer. Tumor DNA extracted from cores of 203 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) p53abn EC were Shallow Whole Genome (sWGS) sequenced. sWGS is a high-throughput technology designed to achieve genome-wide genetic variation accurately and cost-effectively. Raw data were aligned and treated to correct CG content and discard low-quality reads. Copy number alterations were called considering 5 to 9 copies as amplification and more than 9 as high-level amplification. Amplification data was later compared to HER2 and CCNE1 whole-section immunohistochemistry (IHC). Gene amplification is one of the major molecular pathways that can drive tumorigenesis, and many amplified genes have emerged as biological markers and therapeutic targets. <i>HER2<\/i> amplification has an important prognostic and therapeutic implications in breast and gastric cancer. It is also seen in EC, arising as a possible targeted treatment opportunity for p53abn EC using anti-HER2 drugs. <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplifications have been reported in platinum resistance aggressive ovarian and endometrial cancers and is known to be a biomarker to predict responsive to low-dose WEE1i-ATRi. Amplifications in <i>CCNE1<\/i> were identified in 13% (26\/203) of the cohort while the IHC overexpression (2\/3+) was recorded in 64% of cases. <i>HER2<\/i> amplifications were observed in 11% (22\/203) of p53abn ECs compared to the IHC overexpression (2\/3+) detected in 21%. Significant intratumor heterogeneity was identified. We found discrepancy between the techniques, with IHC detecting a significantly greater proportion of p53abn ECs overexpressing HER2 and CCNE1 than amplification found on sWGS. This phenomenon may be explained by the intratumor heterogeneity that was identified during the IHC scoring. The IHC was performed in whole sections while cores were used to extract DNA for the sWGS, which may have missed the gene amplification areas. Although there are some limitations, sWGS is a relatively inexpensive assay that can be performed on FFPE, and it is able to obtain whole genome sequence at a very low coverage (between 0.4x and 1x) with over 99% accuracy for copy number calls. In recent years sWGS have been used efficiently for copy number profiling tumors and for amplification detection thus having the potential to be implemented in clinical practice to guide targeted therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene amplification,Endometrial cancer,HER2,Cyclin E,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Juliana Sobral de Barros<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Amy Jamieson<sup>2<\/sup>, Dawn Cochrane<sup>3<\/sup>, Maxwell Douglas<sup>3<\/sup>, Janine Senz<sup>3<\/sup>, Blake Gilks<sup>4<\/sup>, Christine Chow<sup>5<\/sup>, Shelby Thornton<sup>6<\/sup>, Jessica  N.

Accurate PC detection at early or premalignant stage, when surgery is effective, would increase survival rates and prevent unnecessary surgery or surveillance. About 10% of PC cases arise from pancreatic cystic (PCy) lesions, including intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), which constitute up to 30% of resective pancreatic surgery. Current diagnostic methods cannot accurately predict which cysts are malignancy-associated. Molecular diagnostic attempts using PCy fluid (PCyF), as a liquid biopsy, to analyze common mutations associated with PC development are yet to contribute to early diagnosis. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is utilized in various cancers, PC inclusive, for detecting genetic changes associated with carcinogenesis, but not in PCyF due to technical limitations, including isolated DNA purity.<br \/>Aim: To establish a <i>de novo <\/i>platform for WGS of PCyF.<br \/>Methods: Three PC cell lines (PANC1, AsPC1 and MiaPACA2) were cultured <i>in vitro<\/i>. Five PCyF samples, including one from PC patient (based on histopathology report) were obtained from the University of Hull (UoH)-based ethically approved study (TEM-PAC, NCT03536793, REC 18\/LO\/0736). Genomic DNA (gDNA) isolation protocol was optimized using magnetic- and column-based kits (MagMAX DNA Multi-sample and PureLink Genomic DNA; ThermoFisher) and varying number of cultured cells (100,000-500,000; to determine detection limits) and used for PCyF samples (35 - 70 &#956;l). gDNA purity (A260\/280 &#8805; 1.8 and A260\/230 &#8805; 2) and concentration were determined using NanoDrop2000, and amount per cell was calculated. WGS of PC sample was done using 200ng of gDNA on Illumina NovaSeq6000 platform (Novogene Ltd, Cambridge, UK) at 50x sequencing depth. Sequencing reads were mapped to reference human genome (hg38) with the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner to detect disease-related genomic variants in each chromosome covered - insertion-deletions (InDels), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy number variants (CNVs) and structural variants (SVs) with subsequent analysis using UoH High Performance Computer Viper.<br \/>Results: Pure gDNA was isolated from all cell lines (0.03 &#177; 0.01 ng\/cell) and from PCyF samples (217 ng - 13.8 &#956;g; equivalent to 7,000 - 690,000 cells and 8 - 346 ng\/&#181;l). WGS of PC patient PCyF revealed several cancer-related changes\/variants including 106,776 (12.31%) novel InDels, 181,000 more SNPs, CNVs (337 gains; 149 losses) and 10,024 SVs.<br \/>Conclusions: We established a <i>de novo <\/i>platform for WGS analysis of gDNA isolated from small volumes of PCyF samples, including estimation of previously unknown cellular density in these liquid biopsies.

As technologies have matured, the number of cells that can be processed in a single experiment has seen exponential growth with workflows now assaying up to one million cells in an individual experiment.<br \/>While high throughput sequencing methods have facilitated the discovery and characterization of various cell types, sequencing costs can be prohibitively high for routine use. Many applications of scRNA-seq are focused on cell type identification, gene regulatory networks, or biomarker discovery. These applications often do not require surveying the entire transcriptome, but rather require the interrogation of specific sets of well-characterized genes. In these cases, sequencing the entire transcriptome may be adding unnecessary project costs. To increase throughput and minimize sequencing costs, the development of a targeted gene enrichment method is required.<br \/>Here we extend our whole transcriptome split-pool combinatorial barcoding technology, to enable enrichment of a subset of genes in the final single cell sequencing libraries. To illustrate the power of our technology, we enriched a whole transcriptome library of human bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) from four acute myeloid leukemia (AML) donors and four control donors. From a library of 27,000 cells, we used our immune gene panel to enrich 1,000 genes representing canonical immune cell markers and pathways. Our method increased the percent of reads on target from as low as 1.6% in the whole transcriptome libraries to 75% in the targeted libraries. Furthermore, despite a nearly ten-fold reduction in sequencing reads between unenriched and enriched libraries, the resulting clustering yielded very high concordance of cell type identities and preserved AML-specific signatures such as FLT3, MKI67, and CD19.<br \/>Overall, we demonstrate our modular enrichment strategy preserves biological structure of the data and allows for deep characterization of gene signatures in health and disease. We envision our approach will enable researchers to simultaneously reduce sequencing costs while drastically scaling up the number of cells and samples across experiments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-03 High-throughput sequencing,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Targeted sequencing (1000 immune gene panel),scRNA-seq and immune gene panel enrichment ,Acute myeloid leukemia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Grace Kim<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Efthymia Papalexi<sup><\/sup>, Peter Matulich<sup><\/sup>, Ryan Koehler<sup><\/sup>, Sarah Schroeder<sup><\/sup>, Vuong Tran<sup><\/sup>, Charles Roco<sup><\/sup>, Alexander Rosenberg<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Parse Biosciences, Inc., Seattle, WA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c19a7b35-52f1-47c7-98ff-93d2048554d9","ControlNumber":"7551","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>G.

NK cell gene signatures are associated with improved survival in several indications, and NK cell therapies have shown some encouraging results in the clinic. These data highlight the relevance of this cell type in anti-tumor immunity and has given rise to interest in amplifying NK responses to cancer as a complementary therapeutic strategy to current T cell based immunotherapies. The goal of this project is to identify tumor cell intrinsic negative regulators of NK cell-mediated tumor cell killing through in vivo CRISPR\/Cas9 screening, with identification of both PD-1 blockade-dependent and -independent regulators. The syngeneic B16F10 model in C57Bl6 mice was used with or without NK depletion and with or without anti-PD1 treatment, with a custom library of 900 genes split into four subpools (one guide per gene per subpool). B16F10 cells were transduced in vitro and inoculated into mice ten days after spinfection. On day 14 after inoculation, tumors were harvested and subsequently the gDNA was isolated and sequenced. QC analysis indicated good guide recovery and screen performance. There were several hits from this screen that were depleted in the NK+ context but not in the NK depleted context, indicating their potential role in regulating NK mediated cell killing. Of the hits, several expected genes scored including B2M which is a known negative regulator of NK cell killing. Validation efforts include confirmation of dropout in other models as well as in vitro co-culture assays to assess enhanced NK killing of single gene KO cells. The hits identified in the screen will increase our understanding of anti-tumor immunity and serve as potential novel Oncology targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR\/Cas9,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kayla Duval<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Elsa Krall<sup><\/sup>, Federica Piccioni<sup><\/sup>, Maria Monberg<sup><\/sup>, Marianne Spatz<sup><\/sup>, Tobias Ehrenberger<sup><\/sup>, Nicole Follmer<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Merck Research Labs, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"69702016-922f-49c0-9055-94e9a660d843","ControlNumber":"4567","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;K.

Additionally, small cohorts, as used in previous studies, lack the power to estimate the prevalence of specific recurrent mutations.<br \/>We evaluated 177540 advanced cancer patients, across 84 different tumor types, who were sequenced as part of routine clinical care on the FoundationOne&#174;CDx platform. Off-target sequencing reads were mapped to the mitochondrial genome (rCRS) and variant calling was performed. We had a median read depth of 18 and filtering by allele frequency (&#60;= 95% and &#62;= 5%) led to the identification almost 400,000 predicted somatic mitochondrial variants. Over 80% of patients had at least one mitochondrial variant detected, with an average of 2.2 mitochondrial variants detected per patient.<br \/>We next assessed each recurrent mitochondrial short variant to look for associations with specific cancers. The alteration with the strongest enrichment was G3224A, a mutation in the mitochondrial leucine tRNA gene (MT-TL1), which had a prevalence of 3.6% (51\/1426) in thyroid cancer samples, as compared to 0.05% (85\/176114) in all other disease types (OR=76.8, P&#60;2.2e-16). The G3244A mutation has been previously identified as occurring in thyroid cancer, specifically Hurthle cell carcinomas, as well as in the mitochondrial disease MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes). Thyroid cancer samples in our dataset with G3244A were found to be associated with thyroid follicular carcinomas (7\/124, 5.6%) and Hurthle cell carcinomas (7\/57, 12.2%). Additional recurrent MT-TL1 mutations were identified in the thyroid cancer cohort at positions 3242 (9\/1426) and 3248 (5\/1426).<br \/>We also identified a mutation in the NADH dehydrogenase subunit MT-ND1. G3380A has been previously shown to occur in thyroid and colorectal cancer and results in a R25Q mutation that is thought to affect ND1 function. G3380A was identified in 26\/1426 (1.8%) of thyroid cancer patients. The majority of G3380A variants occurred in thyroid anaplastic carcinomas 23\/26 (88.5%).<br \/>Our dataset has allowed us to identify and determine the prevalence of rare mitochondrial short variant alterations in cancer. Further research is needed to investigate associations of these alterations with other clinical features.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitochondrial DNA,Cancer genomics,Thyroid cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Julia F.

Understanding the biology involved in this transition is of interest, especially for the identification of genes where a mutation may be facilitating the transition. As the occurrence of mutations are often rare, identifying these markers in an affected population of patients can be challenging. Here we describe a method using hyper- and hypomethylation, which can mimic the loss and gain of function caused by mutations, as a surrogate to identify mutations potentially involved in the transition of tumors from hot to cold.<br \/>Methods: Breast cancer methylation and corresponding gene expression data were downloaded from TCGA. Samples were classified as immune hot or cold tumors, the latter being either an immunosuppressive state or immune inert state, by a previously defined gene algorithm [1]. Genes that contributed to immune state classification were compared between gene expression and hypermethylation status by creating a new logistic regression model for the latter. A candidate list of genes that were hypermethylated in cold tumors was created. As a validation step, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) expression and mutation data were downloaded from Depmap. Cell lines were classified as hot or cold by the same algorithm and were curated for damaging mutations within the derived gene list. For each candidate gene, the number of damaging mutations in cold cell lines was compared to the number of wild type &#8220;hot&#8221; cell lines (Chi-squared analysis) and significance was determined by comparing observed values to the distribution of 1000 randomly selected gene sets.<br \/>Results: Of the final 1562 candidate genes, 420 genes had at least a 5% difference in hot and cold phenotypes between cell lines with and without a damaging mutation in that gene when compared to the methylation data (Z=10.24 , p&#60;0.001). The candidate list of genes was enriched for transcription factors and a previously curated list of tumor suppressor genes.<br \/>Conclusions: In this proof of principle study, we show that there is a correlation between methylation status in genes that classify tumor immune microenvironment in tumors and the presence of mutations in the same immune effector cell lines which can potentially be used to identify candidate genes involved in the immune status of tumors. While the role of these mutations is unknown, they are enriched for transcription factors and tumor suppressors genes.<br \/>References: [1] Seitz, R.S., Hurwitz, M.E., Nielsen, T.J. <i>et al.<\/i> Translation of the 27-gene immuno-oncology test (IO score) to predict outcomes in immune checkpoint inhibitor treated metastatic urothelial cancer patients. <i>J Transl Med<\/i> <b>20<\/b>, 370 (2022). https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/s12967-022-03563-9","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-04 Large-scale approaches to cancer gene discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Gene Discovery,Methylation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Catherine  T.

In the Phase IIB VITAL study involving stage 3\/4 ovarian cancer patients, recurrence-free survival and overall survival in patients who were BRCA1\/2 wild-type was improved in patients receiving Gemogenovatucel-T as compared to placebo. The same improvements in recurrence-free and overall survival were not observed in patients with pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations in BRCA1\/2 genes. Similar improvements were demonstrated in patients who were homologous recombination proficient.<br \/>For future clinical trials it is necessary to rapidly examine genomic DNA from blood of ovarian cancer patients to determine BRCA mutation status for eligibility to manufacture autologous Gemogenovatucel-T. An oligonucleotide hybridization-based capture panel targeting the coding exons and adjacent intronic regions of 293 oncology-related genes was developed for use in enriching DNA libraries molecules for sequencing on the Illumina platform. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the utility of this panel for detection of likely pathogenic and pathogenic mutations in the BRCA1\/2 genes.<br \/>Genomic DNA from Gemogenovatucel-T preparations from the Phase IIB trial including 10 patients harboring known mutations in the BRCA1\/2 genes and 2 BRCA wild type patients was processed through library preparation, hybridization-based capture using the 293 gene probe set, and sequencing on the Illumina NextSeq 2000. All eleven previously identified pathogenic mutations in BRCA1\/BRCA2 gene, including 8 short insertions\/deletions (INDELs) and 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected with the method. No false positive pathogenic BRCA mutations were detected in any of the 12 samples. The panel was evaluated further using a set of reference genomic DNAs from Horizon Discovery containing known polymorphisms in BRCA as well as 30 other oncology-related genes. 100% of the expected SNPs and INDELs with an allele frequency of &#62;3% were detected; no false positive likely pathogenic or pathogenic polymorphisms with an allele frequency of &#62;2.5% were detected in the genomic DNA of healthy control patients.<br \/>The 293 gene panel will be suitable for identification of BRCA mutations in patients to screen patients eligible for Gemogenovatucel-T manufacturing. The entire process starting with blood DNA extraction and ending with report generation can be completed in about 3.5 days.

The Genexus System supports oncology research panels such as OCA Plus, which is comprised of over 13,000 amplicons, and enables low input requirements of just 20ng of FFPE DNA and RNA. This study utilized cell lines, reference controls, and orthogonally tested FFPE research samples to evaluate detection of DNA variants, copy number alterations, RNA fusions, and key research endpoints, including MSI, TMB, and HRD. The OCA Plus panel was also evaluated for the ability to detect arm-level copy number changes in orthogonally validated FFPE samples.<br \/>Results: Commercial reference controls and FFPE research samples were sequenced using OCA Plus on the Genexus System to an average depth of &#8805;24 million reads per sample, with four DNA and RNA samples supported per run. SNV and MNV calling performance was assessed using the AcroMetrix Oncology Hotspot Control which has 377 variants covered by OCA Plus and delivered SNV sensitivity and PPV &#62;99% and MNV sensitivity of &#62;99% and PPV &#62;95%. MSI status was assessed using orthogonally tested FFPE samples from various tumor tissues (stomach, endometrial, colorectal) and returned status concordance of 99.4% with sensitivity and PPV &#62;99%. The TMB endpoint was tested using commercial controls and FFPE samples with a correlation of r<sup>2<\/sup> &#62; 0.90 to orthogonal measurements. RNA Fusion reference controls showed 100% positive correlation. Copy number gain detection shows sensitivity of 99% and PPV &#62;95%, while homologous copy loss gives 100% PPV and sensitivity of &#62;90%. We also demonstrate high concordance to orthogonal methods in detection of HER2 amplifications, and the ability to detect arm-level copy number alterations such as 1p\/19q co-deletions in IDH1 positive glioma samples.<br \/>Conclusion: The Genexus System combines minimal touch points and a rapid turnaround time to enable comprehensive genomic profiling for research assays such as OCA Plus for detection of rare variants and low-level fusion transcripts. Further, by providing accurate characterization of key oncology research endpoints, the Genexus System can accelerate research in oncology. For research use only.

This amounts to approximately 35-40% of patients with DLBCL who fail treatment with standard of care immunochemotherapy. We have extended and modified a plasma-based NGS workflow for DLBCL. To evaluate inter-site robustness of our workflow, we conducted a pilot study to measure performance of the assay at three laboratories.<br \/>Materials and Methods: A total of 98 samples were available for analysis. Given the requirement for sequencing multiple replicates, contrived samples were used in this pilot study. All labs performed targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) on all samples using a modified version of the AVENIO ctDNA analysis workflow (Roche) which is based on the previously described CAPP-Seq workflow. [1-3] The targeted NGS panel was designed to cover ~314 kb of regions in or near 466 genes relevant for minimal residual disease and cell-of-origin detection in DLBCL. QC metrics were compared on 6 healthy donor plasma samples. For analyzing the sensitivity of single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling, 3 plasma samples were blended so that expected variants were titrated to 1% allelic frequency (AF), and 3 samples to 0.5% AF to mimic low pretreatment ctDNA levels in DLBCL. For analyzing performance of MRD detection, the SNVs in 5 samples were titrated down to 0.05%, 0.01% or 0.005% AF to represent on-treatment samples. MRD detection was evaluated by Monte Carlo sampling comparing ctDNA level against background. [3]<br \/>Results: All replicates of the 6 healthy donor samples had comparable extracted cfDNA within 30% between sites. On-target rates ranged between 67.2 and 74.8% (median: 71.0%) across all sites. Deduplicated sequencing depth was within 20% between sites and ranged from 1321-7346 (median: 2845), depending on the sample. Observed error rates were below 0.005% for all samples. Testing sites achieved 98.6-100% (median: 100%) sensitivity for SNVs at 1% AF blends, and 87.5-100% (median: 96.9%) for 0.5% AF blends. All external sites consistently detected MRD with p &#60; 0.005 at AF levels of 0.05% and 0.01%, and p &#60; 0.05 at 0.005% AF level.<br \/>Conclusion: QC metrics were highly consistent for the same samples prepared at different testing sites. Sensitivity of SNV calling was high, and MRD results were consistent across replicates and sites. We demonstrate that the AVENIO ctDNA NHL assay for plasma and NGS applications provides robust performance for MRD monitoring research.

It has become apparent that pediatric cancers are significantly more heterogeneous than previously thought as evidenced by the number of novel entities and subtypes that have been identified with distinct molecular and clinical characteristics. For most of these newly recognized entities there are extremely limited treatment options available. The ITCC-P4 consortium is an international collaboration between several European academic centers and pharmaceutical companies, with the overall aim to establish a sustainable platform of &#62;400 molecularly well-characterized PDX models of high-risk pediatric cancers, their tumors and matching controls and to use the PDX models for <i>in vivo<\/i> testing of novel mechanism-of-action based treatments. Currently, 251 models are fully characterized, including 182 brain and 69 non-brain PDX models, representing 112 primary models, 92 relapse, 42 metastasis and 4 progressions under treatment models. Using low coverage whole-genome and whole exome sequencing, somatic mutation calling, DNA copy number and methylation analysis we aim to define genetic features in our PDX models and estimate the molecular fidelity of PDX models compared to their patient tumor. Based on DNA methylation profiling we identified 43 different tumor subgroups within 18 cancer entities. Mutational landscape analysis identified key somatic and germline oncogenic drivers. Ependymoma PDX models displayed the <i>C11orf95-RELA <\/i>fusion event, YAP1, C11orf95 and RELA structural variants. Medulloblastoma models were driven by <i>MYCN, TP53, GLI2, SUFU <\/i>and <i>PTEN<\/i>. High-grade glioma samples showed <i>TP53, ATRX, MYCN <\/i>and <i>PIK3CA <\/i>somatic SNVs, along with focal deletions in <i>CDKN2A <\/i>in chromosome 9. Neuroblastoma models were enriched for <i>ALK <\/i>SNVs and\/or <i>MYCN <\/i>focal amplification, <i>ATRX <\/i>SNVs and <i>CDKN2A\/B <\/i>deletions. Tumor mutational burden across entities and copy number analysis was performed to identify allele-specific copy number detection in tumor-normal pairs. Large chromosomal aberrations (deletions, duplications) detected in the PDX models were concurrent with molecular alterations frequently observed in each tumor type -isochromosome 17 was detected in 5 medulloblastoma models, while deletion of chromosome arm 1p or gain of parts of 17q in neuroblastomas which correlate with tumor progression. We observe clonal evolution of somatic variants not only in certain PDX-tumor pairs but also between disease states. The multi-omics approach in this study provides insight into the mutational landscape and patterns of the PDX models thus providing an overview of molecular mechanisms facilitating the identification and prioritization of oncogenic drivers and potential biomarkers for optimal treatment therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-02 Genomic profiling of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Genomics,Pediatric cancers,Whole exome sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Apurva Gopisetty<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Aniello Federico<sup>1<\/sup>, Didier Surdez<sup>2<\/sup>, Yasmine Iddir<sup>2<\/sup>, Sakina Zaidi<sup>2<\/sup>, Alexandra Saint-Charles<sup>2<\/sup>, Joshua Waterfall<sup>2<\/sup>, Elnaz Saberi-Ansari<sup>2<\/sup>, Justyna Wierzbinska<sup>3<\/sup>, Andreas Schlicker<sup>3<\/sup>, Norman Mack<sup>1<\/sup>, Benjamin Schwalm<sup>1<\/sup>, Christopher Previti<sup>1<\/sup>, Lena Weiser<sup>4<\/sup>, Ivo Buchhalter<sup>4<\/sup>, Anna-Lisa Böttcher<sup>1<\/sup>, Martin Sill<sup>1<\/sup>, Robert Autry<sup>1<\/sup>, Frank estermann,<sup>1<\/sup>, David < Jones<sup>1<\/sup>, Richard Volckmann<sup>5<\/sup>, Danny Zwijnenburg<sup>5<\/sup>, Angelika Eggert<sup>6<\/sup>, Olaf Heidenreich<sup>7<\/sup>, Fatima Iradier<sup>8<\/sup>, Irmela Jeremias<sup>9<\/sup>, Heinrich Kovar<sup>10<\/sup>, Jan-Henning Klusmann<sup>11<\/sup>, Klaus-Michael Debatin<sup>12<\/sup>, Simon Bomken<sup>13<\/sup>, Petra Hamerlik<sup>14<\/sup>, Maureen Hattersley<sup>15<\/sup>, Olaf Witt<sup>1<\/sup>, Louis Chesler<sup>16<\/sup>, Alan Mackay<sup>16<\/sup>, Johannes Gojo<sup>17<\/sup>, Stefano Cairo<sup>18<\/sup>, Julia Schueler<sup>19<\/sup>, Johannes Schulte<sup>6<\/sup>, Birgit Geoerger<sup>20<\/sup>, Jan  J.

However, tissue biopsy is so invasive that it can be difficult in some cases. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) assay is a minimally invasive tool obtaining a comprehensive genomic information reflecting a tumor heterogeneity. Recently, the investigation of cfDNA assay in UC is widely conducted, but its clinical utility remains largely unknown. We aimed to establish plasma cfDNA assay and clarify its clinical role in UC.<br \/>Method: Blood and matched tissue were obtained from 48 cases with advanced UC before 1st line systemic therapy or radical surgery.<b> <\/b>For genomic profiling of all samples, we applied a customed targeted DNA-sequencing strategy capturing 54 UC-relevant genes. Somatic mutations were required to be supported by a minimum variant allele frequency (VAF) of 0.5% in plasma cfDNA and 5% in tissue DNA. All mutation calls were filtered against matched leukocyte DNA. The result of mutational analysis was validated with digital PCR. The proportion of tumor-derived cfDNA (circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) fraction) was estimated. We investigated the association between genomic profile and molecular subtyping with RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry (IHC).<br \/>Result: Fifty-five somatic mutations were detected in 22 cfDNA samples (22\/48, 45.8%). Twenty-six of all somatic mutations identified in cfDNA (26\/55, 47.3%) were concurrently present in tumor tissues. In 14 mutations randomly selected from all of those detected in cfDNA, VAF of digital PCR was statistically consisted with the result of NGS (p&#60;0.001, R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.95). Furthermore, digital PCR showed that mutations detected in cfDNA alone were cleared via radical surgery. And those were found in another tissue sample from the same patient. Of the 22 cases, 6 had a ctDNA fraction greater than 2% of total cfDNA. High ctDNA fraction was associated with advanced clinical tumor stage, high PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue by IHC and basal molecular subtype (p = 0.04, 0.02, &#60;0.01, respectively).<br \/>Conclusions: We established cfDNA assay for genome profiling in advanced UC. The result of validation using digital PCR suggested that cfDNA assay can identify the mutation which cannot be detected in tissue sample as a tumor heterogeneity. Additionally, cfDNA assay generate the information for classifying UC cases by molecular subtypes and predicting the expression of immune checkpoint molecules. Further investigation is needed as a promising minimally invasive assay to predict an immunotherapy responsiveness against metastatic UC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell-free DNA,Bladder cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yuki Kita<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Takayuki Sumiyoshi<sup><\/sup>, Takeshi Sano<sup><\/sup>, Akihiro Hamada<sup><\/sup>, Toru Sakatani<sup><\/sup>, Kenji Nakamura<sup><\/sup>, Hideaki Takada<sup><\/sup>, Ryousuke Ikeuchi<sup><\/sup>, Takayuki Goto<sup><\/sup>, Atsuro Sawada<sup><\/sup>, Shusuke Akamatsu<sup><\/sup>, Takashi Kobayashi<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Department of Urology, Kyoto Univ., Kyoto, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"251fcf1f-ccb5-42c8-8894-1e9303e90b02","ControlNumber":"2194","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.
