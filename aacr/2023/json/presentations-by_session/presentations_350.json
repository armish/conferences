[{"Abstract":"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an anti-cancer therapy that utilizes light, a photoresponsive photosensitizer (PS), and oxygen to confer direct cytotoxicity or vascular damage. PDT alters the tumor microenvironment (TME) transiently in a process termed photodynamic priming (PDP), making it more receptive to subsequent therapies. Previous studies reported that PDP exerts immune stimulatory effects via the release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) as a potent inducer of immunogenic cell death. Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a lethal human malignancy with no curable treatments available thus far. The desmoplastic stroma in PC limits the delivery of therapeutic agents contributing to treatment resistance. More, the stroma promotes an immunosuppressive TME that leads to immune exclusion, which is largely responsible for the immunotherapy failure in PC. Therefore, there is an unmet need to find more effective combination therapies against PC. In this work, we evaluated whether PDP enhances anti-PD1 therapy response by modulating immunogenicity in PC patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Visudyne (PS) and varied light doses of 25-100 J\/cm<sup>2<\/sup> were used for PDP treatments. Our data showed light dose dependent cytotoxicity and the expression of DAMPs including HSP60, calreticulin and HMGB1 in PDOs. Gene expression analysis of PDP treated PDOs showed increases in IFN&#947;, TNF&#945; and CXCL12 while decreases in PDL1, TGF&#946;1 and FOXP1. Coculture of healthy donor (HD) monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mDCs) for 24 h with PDOs treated with a sublethal dose of PDP (25 J\/cm<sup>2<\/sup>) showed increased CD40, CD86 and MHC11 activation markers on mDCs. Addition of matched HD na&#239;ve T cells 24 h post mDC-PDO coculture led to the excessive activation of CD4<sup>+ <\/sup>and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells highlighted by the PD1 expression on T cells from 0 h of initial T cell coculture to 48 h. This led us to treat PDO-mDC-T cell cocultures at 0 h to 48 h of initial T cell coculture with the anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody, Pembrolizumab. The treatment response was measured by live imaging of PDO growth followed by the analysis of changes in PDO diameter\/area from day 0 of PDP to day 7 post-PDP. There were significant decreases in PDO growth in cultures treated with PDP followed by Pembrolizumab at different time points compared to untreated PDOs, untreated PDO-mDC-T cell cocultures, PDOs treated with PDP alone, PDO-mDC-T cell cocultures treated with PDP only or PDO-mDC-T cell cocultures treated with anti-PD1 alone. Also, we sorted T cells from the same cocultures at day 7 of PDP for gene expression analysis of T cell activation markers. There was enhanced expression of IFN&#947;, TNF&#945;, FAS ligand, Granzyme B, IL2 and IL21 in T cells collected from combination therapy treated cocultures compared to others. Lastly, our data show that PDP can enhance anti-PD1 immunotherapy responses providing insights into a combination therapy option to treat PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Anti-PD-1,Immunomodulation,Tumor heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Pushpamali De Silva<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Demi Wekking<sup>1<\/sup>, Joanna Joeun Choe<sup>1<\/sup>, Dario Missael Rocha Castellanos<sup>2<\/sup>, Piotr Zelga<sup>2<\/sup>, Russell Jenkins<sup>3<\/sup>, Andrew Scott Liss<sup>2<\/sup>, Tayyaba Hasan<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA,<sup>3<\/sup>MGH Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"95094f60-1871-4634-9965-79eb8a2ab7d8","ControlNumber":"7583","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

To address this shortcoming, we developed a nanotherapeutic (AIRISE-02) that can manipulate both cancer cells and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), leading to successful production of anti-tumor T cells that promote ICIs&#8217; response. AIRISE-02 (Augmenting Immune Response and Inhibiting Suppressive Environment of tumors) is our patented polymer-coated mesoporous silica nanoparticle (Pdx-NP<sup>TM<\/sup>) that co-delivers immunostimulant CpG and siRNA against signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (siSTAT3). CpG is a widely used adjuvant that activates antigen presenting cells (APCs) to process and present tumor antigens. STAT3 contributes to progression, metastasis, and immune escape of cancer cells. STAT3 also has roles in immunosuppressive TME, by inhibiting maturation and activation of APCs, suppressing M1 macrophage polarization, and mediating immunosuppressive function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. AIRISE-02 can be given both intratumorally and systemically. In bilateral B16F10 melanoma and MC38 colon cancer models, three intratumoral injections of AIRISE-02 to one tumor inhibit both treated and untreated distal tumors. When combined with ICIs against PD-1 and CTLA-4, AIRISE-02 leads to long term cure in 63% of mice with B16F10 tumors and 43% of mice with MC38 colon tumors (while ICIs alone provides no cure in B16F10 and 17% cure in MC38 tumor mice). In the tumor rechallenge study at 6 months post-cure, B16F10 mice reject new B16F10 tumors, while allowing LLC-JSP lung tumors to grow, suggesting tumor-specific immune memory effect. Through antibody depletion studies, AIRISE-02&#8217;s activity is shown to be highly dependent on CD8+ T cells and IFN-&#611;, while slightly dependent on B cells and NK cells. Strikingly, depleting CD4+ T cells strongly boosts AIRISE-02&#8217;s activity, which is likely due to depleting regulatory T cells. Effectiveness of AIRISE-02 is owing to the ability of Pdx-NP<sup>TM<\/sup> to retain and protect oligonucleotide cargos in the tumors; e.g., 50% of injected siRNA dose remained at three days with Pdx-NP vs. 2% when given as free siRNA. In addition to STAT3, our platform technology can be tailored to other important therapeutic targets with the power of siRNA. Ongoing works to attack other hard-to-drug targets, such as KRAS, Myc, and AR will also be presented.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Nanoparticle,Microenvironment,siRNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Worapol Ngamcherdtrakul<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Moataz Reda<sup>1<\/sup>, Cole Baker<sup>1<\/sup>, Noah Crumrine<sup>1<\/sup>, Ruijie Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Alyssa Wallstrum<sup>1<\/sup>, Natalie White<sup>1<\/sup>, Jeremy Saito<sup>1<\/sup>, Husam Zaidan<sup>1<\/sup>, Justin Rehwaldt<sup>1<\/sup>, Molly Nelson<sup>1<\/sup>, Joe Gray<sup>2<\/sup>, Wassana Yantasee<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Pdx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Portland, OR,<sup>2<\/sup>Biomedical Engineering, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a11ce4e1-9eb4-4cff-8d64-1901987a390b","ControlNumber":"7200","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>W.

However, tumor microenvironmental factors such as severe hypoxic conditions and vascular anomalies attenuate the therapeutic efficacy of RT, thus resulting in unsatisfactory outcomes in solid tumors. Recently, Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has improved immune recognition to tumor cells and normalized tumor vasculature to diminish hypoxia in solid tumors. Herein, we suggest that RT combined with ICB synergistically alters tumor microenvironments, thus facilitating the recruitment of cytotoxic immune cells into tumors as well as sensitizing radiation effectiveness. RT in combination with ICB not only normalized tumor vasculature to reduce hypoxia, but also increased anti-tumor effects from immune-mediated toxicity and DNA damage-mediated apoptosis in several solid tumor-bearing mouse models to a greater extent than did either monotreatment of RT or ICB. This study will provide mechanistic insight into synergistic effects conferred by RT and ICB as well as a strong preclinical rationale for combining the two therapeutic modalities in human cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-05 Immune mechanisms invoked by radiation therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation,Immune checkpoint blockade,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Minjeong Kang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, DaeYong Lee<sup><\/sup>, Yifan Wang<sup><\/sup>, Betty Kim<sup><\/sup>, Wen Jiang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"159abbf7-9c9d-4f4c-bd71-8892a92425bf","ControlNumber":"4077","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

RT is thought to induce immune responses to cellular damage, but the understanding of their evolution and relation to fractionation is limited. We are conducting a serial biospecimen collection in such pts with baseline, 2, 6 and 12 week (wk) sampling. We report serial measurement of tumor and peripheral blood lymphocyte responses for each regimen.<br \/>Method. \u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009Multiplex immunofluorescence quantified tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (CD8, FOXP3). Routine diagnostic flow cytometry quantified circulating lymphocytes. A multiplex ELISA quantified cytokines in blood plasma. Bulk RNA-sequencing (QuantSeq) quantified gene expression within the tumor.<br \/>Result. \u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009We report results for 20pts who received RT for stage III\/IV LARC (13 LCCRT, 7 SCRT-C). Biopsy results are available for 10pts, circulating lymphocytes for 20pts and peripheral blood cytokines for 16pts. \u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009In LCCRT patients (n=8), relative to baseline, tumor infiltrating cytotoxic (CD8+) T cells were uniformly decreased during (2wks, P&#60;0.05) and directly after treatment (6wks, P&#60;0.05) before returning to baseline at 12wks. T regulatory cells (FOXP3+) similarly significantly decreased at 2wks and 6wks but remained below baseline at 12wks (P&#60;0.05). Circulating lymphocytes also fell at wk2 and wk6 after commencing LCCRT and had begun recovering by wk12(n=13; P&#60;0.05). The concentrations of circulating interleukins secreted by (IL2, IL8) or which activate T-lymphocytes (IL2, IL15) were reduced in the circulation at wk2 (n= 9; P&#60;0.05) and wk6 (NS). \u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009In SCRT-C patients, we noted an increase in CD8 T cells at 2wks in 2\/2 pts, also reflected in gene expression data, and an increase in FOXP3 T cells in 1\/2 pts. Circulating lymphocytes were similarly decreased at wk2 in both the SCRT-C (n=7) and LCCRT (n=13) pts, but this reduction was less marked within the SCRT-C cohort at wk6 (P&#60;0.01) and wk12 (P&#60;0.05) relative to LCCRT patients. IL2, IL8 and IL15 did not change during or after SCRT-C (n=7; NS).<br \/>Conclusion. \u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009LCCRT caused a drop in T cells during treatment, whilst SCRT-C appears to induce intra-tumoral T cell responses from wk2 and abrogates systemic reactions to a lesser extent. These results require evaluation in a larger cohort but have implications for understanding how RT induces microenvironmental changes and impacts pelvic bone marrow. We show in vivo that SCRT may be more immunostimulatory in LARC, with implications for trials combining RT with immunotherapy. \u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009 \u0009\u0009\u0009 \u0009\u0009","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-05 Immune mechanisms invoked by radiation therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation therapy,T lymphocytes,Immune response,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lily  V.

Due to primary resistance or the development of acquired resistance to therapeutic approaches these patients unfortunately do not benefit from a long-lasting overall survival benefit. Combination treatments are a promising approach to induce a sustained anti-tumor immune response. However, dose limiting adverse events in healthy tissues and\/or the complex expensive production requirements have limited the full therapeutic potential of combinatorial applications. mRNA-based combinatorial therapy options have evolved by recent advancements in the production, purification, and delivery of mRNA to cells. Today, mRNA therapies are a rapidly growing class of medications that can redefine how many diseases are treated. These therapies enable the production of biologics directly in the patient and mRNA LNPs are easy to manufacture at scale. Despite these key advantages, mRNA therapeutics are yet to show their true potential in oncology. Dose limiting toxicities of mRNA immunotherapies are driven, in part, by systemic payload (encoded protein) toxicity, which can be avoided by engineering the mRNA to improve its onco-selectivity and thereby reduce systemic target-mediated adverse events. Kernal Biologics develops novel onco-selective mRNA therapies directed to breach the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Based on our proprietary machine learning-enabled computational pipeline, we designed our next generation mRNA therapeutics. These mRNAs have the potential to increase the depth and breadth of anti-PD1\/PD-L1 treatment plus enable responses in patients that are currently non-responders or refractory to the clinically approved immune checkpoint blockade therapies. Here, we describe combination therapies of tumor-selective mRNA LNPs that achieve strong and lasting anti-tumor efficacy in syngeneic tumor models. We observed regression of established tumors, complete responses (CRs) and improved overall survival. At efficacious doses the mRNA LNPs were well tolerated while driving anti-tumor immune activation and modulation of the tumor microenvironment. Mouse blood hematology and chemistry analyses were within a normal range. Similarly, pathological immunohistochemistry analysis of liver, spleen and bone marrow revealed no findings. In summary, our data support the feasibility of onco-selective mRNA combination treatment of a variety of cancers with poor T cell infiltration and immunosuppressive TME, major obstacles in cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"mRNA,Lipids,Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Manfred Kraus<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Rudy Christmas<sup><\/sup>, Tom  A.

Targeting CCR8, which is highly expressed in tumor-infiltrating Tregs, has shown its potency in reducing tumor burden and increasing responsiveness to immune-checkpoint blockade therapy. Collectively, this suggests a need for preclinical models that support Treg-targeted therapies. To address this, Biocytogen developed a triple humanized (B-hPD-1\/hPD-L1\/hCCR8) mouse model to evaluate <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy of combination therapies. In this model, the full coding sequence of murine <i>Ccr8 <\/i>was replaced by the full coding sequence of human <i>CCR8<\/i>, while murine <i>Pd-1<\/i> and <i>Pd-l1 <\/i>IgV domains were replaced by their human counterpart gene sequences. Human PD-1 and PD-L1 protein expression was confirmed in B-hPD-1\/hPD-L1\/hCCR8 mice by flow cytometry, and human CCR8 protein expression was observed in MC38 tumors harvested from B-hPD-1\/hPD-L1\/hCCR8 mice. Finally, combination therapy using anti-human PD-1 and anti-human CCR8 antibodies were effective in controlling B-hPD-L1 MC38 tumor growth in B-hPD-1\/hPD-L1\/hCCR8 mice. Altogether, this line provides a powerful preclinical model for <i>in vivo<\/i> evaluation of therapeutic antibodies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,PD-1,Mouse models,Antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Linlin Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiao Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>James Jin<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, Yuxiang Yu<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Biocytogen Pharmaceuticals (Beijing) Co., Ltd., Beijing, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Biocytogen Boston Corp, Wakefield, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"007a5f3f-2cd5-450a-b16c-0b1e2edab1a8","ControlNumber":"4863","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

Primarily driven by apoptotic cell death, PGE2 is thought to elicit wound-healing responses to help provide an immunosuppressive and proliferative niche that supports cancer stem cell repopulation and thereby therapy-resistance. While COX1\/2 inhibitors that attenuate PGE2 production have shown promising anti-cancer effects in various (pre-)clinical settings, the gastrointestinal- and cardiotoxicities precluded their development as anti-cancer agents. It is anticipated that specific targeting of PGE2 signaling via its cognate receptors constitutes a safer and potentially more effective approach. Of the receptor subtypes EP1-4, G&#945;,s-coupled EP2 and EP4 are believed to be directly involved in immunosuppressive effects of PGE2.OCT-598 is a novel, highly potent and selective EP2\/EP4 dual antagonist with Ki values of 23 nM and 0.2 nM vs EP2 and EP4, respectively. PGE2 inhibited normal differentiation of human monocytes into CD1a+CD16- dendritic cells under the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4 and promoted differentiation towards CD1a-CD16+ macrophages in vitro. However, EP2\/EP4 dual inhibition by OCT-598 reversed this phenomenon to a greater extent than either EP2- or EP4-specific inhibitor alone. In vivo, OCT-598 effected tumor growth inhibition in multiple syngeneic mouse models as a single agent as well as in combination with an immune checkpoint blocker (ICB). Furthermore, the addition of OCT-598 to the lung cancer standard-of-care regimen (anti-PD-1 plus chemotherapy) in TC-1 mouse lung adenocarcinoma model gave rise to complete tumor regression. In conclusion, dual blockade of EP2 and EP4 by OCT-598 is shown to be a compelling strategy to reinforce antitumor effects by thwarting PGE2-mediated therapy resistance and immune evasion.Findings from this study provide a rationale for clinical development of OCT-598 as a therapeutic option for human malignant cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,PGE2,EP2 EP4 dual antagonist,Combination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Youngrae Lee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sujeong Baek<sup>2<\/sup>, Dong Kwon Kim<sup>3<\/sup>, Yeri Lee<sup>4<\/sup>, Donggeon Kim<sup>4<\/sup>, Seongin Jo<sup>4<\/sup>, Sang Kyun Lim<sup>4<\/sup>, Young Sook Shin<sup>4<\/sup>, Soonsang Kwon<sup>1<\/sup>, Seung Min Yang<sup>2<\/sup>, Young Taek Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Seong-san Kang<sup>5<\/sup>, Chun-Bong Synn<sup>3<\/sup>, Kwangmin Na<sup>2<\/sup>, Mi Hyun Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Heekyung Han<sup>2<\/sup>, Yu Jin Han<sup>2<\/sup>, Sungwoo Lee<sup>5<\/sup>, Jae Hwan Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Mi Ran Yun<sup>2<\/sup>, Youngseon Byeon<sup>2<\/sup>, Young Seob Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Ji Yun Lee<sup>6<\/sup>, Jii Bum Lee<sup>6<\/sup>, Chang Gon Kim<sup>6<\/sup>, Min Hee Hong<sup>6<\/sup>, Sun Min Lim<sup>6<\/sup>, Kyoung-Ho Pyo<sup>2<\/sup>, Byoung Chul Cho<sup>6<\/sup>, Taeyoung Yoon<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>OSCOTEC Inc., Seongnam, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Severance Biomedical Science Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Brain Korea 21 PLUS Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>KANAPH Therapeutics Inc., Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>5<\/sup>JEUK Institute for Cancer Research, Gumi, Korea, Republic of,<sup>6<\/sup>Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, Yonsei Cancer Center, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"888fe142-c5d4-4efc-b496-0f0a7e1d632b","ControlNumber":"4028","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;Y.

Maximal safe resection and adjuvant chemotherapy improve survival but there is no cure and hence improved therapies are urgently needed. CAR T cell therapy has been FDA approved for hematologic malignancies but there are some barriers to their application for solid tumors in the clinic such as heterogenous tumor antigen expression. Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cells combine the cytolytic potency of T cells with the tumor specificity of an antibody. The interleukin 13 receptor alpha 2 (IL13R&#945;2) is an important target of CAR T cell therapy in ongoing GBM clinical trials. However, regulation of IL13Ra2 expression in GBM is unclear. Identifying upstream regulators of IL13R&#945;2 will not only help delineate IL13R&#945;2 carcinogenesis but also may help improve CAR T cell therapy. Utilizing knockout and overexpression constructs, we have identified protein kinase C family as an upstream regulator of IL13R&#945;2 transcription and translation in GBM cell lines. We have also identified a small molecule regulator of IL13R&#945;2, Ingenol-3-Angelate (I3A), that inhibits U87 tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore, I3A enhances IL13R&#945;2 re-directed CAR T cell mediated tumor cytolysis <i>in vitro<\/i>. Importantly, I3A treatment increases interferon gamma secretion by T cells. Taken together, our data implicates PKC isoforms as an upstream regulator of IL13R&#945;2. I3A treatment may serve as a therapeutic strategy to enhance CAR T mediated killing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Immunotherapy,Glioblastoma multiforme,Protein kinase C,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Siddharth Subham<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, John  D.

The response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy in GC is heterogeneous due to tumor-intrinsic and acquired immunotherapy resistance.<br \/>Methods: A novel immunophenotype-based subtyping algorithm was established to analyze tumor patient-derived bulk transcriptomic data.

Our analysis further identifies a panel of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) as potential druggable targets in the immune desert-type GC.

REBNOBATE is a single-arm multicenter phase 2 trial of first-line RegoNivo in patients (pts) with uHCC (NCT04310709). In this study, we present the final clinical outcomes of RENOBATE and integrative biomarker analysis. Pts with &#62;19 years, ECOG PS 0 or 1, BCLC stage B or C, and no prior systemic therapy were eligible. Pts received Nivo 480 mg iv, every 4 wks, and Rego 80 mg daily po, 3 wks on\/1 wk off, every 4 wks. Tumor&nbsp;response was assessed according to RECIST v1.1 every 8 wks. ctDNA analysis was performed using the Guardant 360 CDx platform (n=42). scRNA-seq was performed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at baseline (e.g., C1D1, n=28) and C1D15 (n=19) from early progression (EP) group (pts with PD or tumor burden increases towards PD on the first evaluation) and long-term response (LR) group (pts with PR or SD &#62; 6 months).&nbsp;A total of 42 pts was enrolled. Response rates were 31.0% and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.4 mo (95% CI, 4.2-13.0) and 1-year OS rate was 80.5% (95% CI, 63.0-90.3%). Aberrations of Wnt\/&#946;-Catenin and PI3K\/mTOR pathways identified in ctDNA were not associated with efficacy outcomes. scRNA-seq revealed that genes upregulated in immune cells on C1D15 (vs. baseline) were associated with immune activation and regulation of angiogenesis. Unsupervised clustering identified 13 immune subets; among them, classical monocyte showed most prominent changes in their proportion and gene expression profiles. After RegoNivo treatment, CD8 T cell clusters had enhanced expressions of genes related to cytoxicity, tissue homing (i.e., CXCR6, CX3CR1, and CXCR3) and proliferation (MKI67), and monophaghocyte clusters showed an enrichment of the gene signatures representing polarization towards M1-related features. Importantly, enrichment of cytotoxic features of the T cell clusters and M1-polarizing features of monophagocyte clusters were more pronounced in LR group than in EP group. From the analysis of differentially expressed genes monophagocyte clusters between the EP and LR groups, a surface molecule &#8216;X&#8217; was identified as a potential biomarker involved in resistance to RegoNivo.&nbsp;RegoNivo showed promising efficacy outcomes in pts with uHCC. Through scRNA-seq of serial PBMCs, we identified enhanced cellular immune responses induced by RegoNivo and found a potential predictive marker for immunotherapy in pts with uHCC. Our study highlighted that Rego, a multikinase inhibitor, might synergize with anti-PD-1 in pts with uHCC. Association between differential features of T cell and monophagocyte clusters induced by this combination and distinct clinical outcomes highlights the importance of immune-modulation in HCC pts and suggests a potential to further harness these signals.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Nivolumab,Regorafenib,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Hyung-Don Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Seyoung Jung<sup>2<\/sup>, Baek-Yeol Ryoo<sup>1<\/sup>, Min-Hee Ryu<sup>1<\/sup>, Beodeul Kang<sup>3<\/sup>, Hong Jae Chon<sup>3<\/sup>, Jung Yong Hong<sup>4<\/sup>, Ho Yeong Lim<sup>4<\/sup>, Jeong Seok Lee<sup>5<\/sup>, <b>June-Young Koh<\/b><sup>5<\/sup>, Changhoon Yoo<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Oncology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Medical Oncology, CHA Bundang Medical Center, CHA University School of Medicine, Seongnam, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>5<\/sup>Genome Insight Technology, Inc., Daejeon, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"00178c80-0811-4e21-8540-1fc16258e982","ControlNumber":"5457","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

In other types of solid tumor, regulatory T cells (Tregs) harbouring markers of highly suppressive effector Tregs (eTregs) correlates with poor responses to PD-1 blockade, prompting combination therapy based on eTregs depletion. Yet, subsets of Tregs remain to be determined in breast &#38; gynecologic cancers, in order to: (i) evaluate the role of eTregs in resistances to PD-1 blockade, (ii) identify the most selective target for eTregs depletion tailored to tumors context and combination strategy.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: We collected public single-cell RNA\/TCR-sequencing data from primary tumors and metastases of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer patients (TNBC, N = 28) biopsied before and after &#945;PD-1 (pembrolizumab). Microarray data from primary TNBC (N = 124) biopsied before and after &#945;PD-1 were quired for association with clinical responses. Deep phenotyping of Tregs from normal breast tissues (N = 4) and primary breast tumors (N = 8) or gynecologic tumors (N = 17) was performed by mass cytometry. ALD2510 (&#945;CD25NIB, Alderaan Biotechnology) is a novel non-IL-2 blocking Fc-optimized anti-CD25 mAb (1). &#945;PD-1 and &#945;CD25NIB combination was evaluated using: (i) a humanized &#945;CD25NIB in CD34<sup>+<\/sup> humanized NSG mice grafted with human TNBC cell lines, (ii) a murine surrogate of &#945;CD25NIB in a syngeneic TNBC mouse model.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: CD25<sup>high<\/sup> Tregs were accumulating in breast &#38; gynecologic tumor tissues. In TNBC patients treated with &#945;PD-1, fractions of CD25<sup>high<\/sup> Tregs were further increased. CD25<sup>high<\/sup> Tregs highly expressed eTregs-related molecules in primary tumors, invaded tumor-draining lymph nodes and distant metastases. Amongst the potential therapeutic targets for Treg depletion, only CD25, 4-1BB and CCR8 were largely restricted to intratumoral CD25<sup>high<\/sup> eTregs. Yet, CD25 was the best candidate for CD25<sup>high<\/sup> eTregs depletion with limited on-target off-Treg effects, as: (i) CCR8 marked a small fractions of CD25<sup>high<\/sup> eTregs in primary tumors and was not detected in metastasis, (ii) 4-1BB marked antigen-experienced &#945;&#946;CD8 T cell revigorated by PD-1 blockade, (iii) only CD25<sup>high<\/sup> eTregs expressed 4-1BB and CCR8, yet TCR clonotype analysis revealed that CD25<sup>high<\/sup> eTregs originate in part from activated CD25<sup>+<\/sup> Tregs, suggesting that anti-CCR8\/-4-1BB mAbs may be ineffective due to CD25<sup>high<\/sup> eTregs replenishment in tumors. In murine models resistant to &#945;PD-1 alone, &#945;CD25NIB effectively depleted intratumoral CD25<sup>high<\/sup> eTregs, with limited effects on peripheral Tregs, and synergized with &#945;PD-1 by restoring a positive effector &#945;&#946;CD8 T cells\/Tregs ratio, leading to tumor clearance without adverse effects.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: This study supports clinical evaluation of CD25<sup>high<\/sup> effector Tregs depletion by ALD2510 in patients with breast or gynecologic cancers resistant to PD-1 blockade.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Regulatory T cells,Pembrolizumab,Combination therapy,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Stéphane FATTORI<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Aude Le Roy<sup>2<\/sup>, Jemila Houacine<sup>2<\/sup>, Lucie Robert<sup>3<\/sup>, Riad Abes<sup>2<\/sup>, Laurent Gorvel<sup>1<\/sup>, Samuel Granjeaud<sup>4<\/sup>, Marie-Sarah Rouvière<sup>5<\/sup>, Amira Ben Amara<sup>5<\/sup>, Nicolas Boucherit<sup>5<\/sup>, Carole Tarpin<sup>6<\/sup>, Jihane Pakradouni<sup>7<\/sup>, Emmanuelle Charafe-Jauffret<sup>8<\/sup>, Julien Barrou<sup>8<\/sup>, Gilles Houvenaeghel<sup>8<\/sup>, Eric Lambaudie<sup>8<\/sup>, François Bertucci<sup>6<\/sup>, Philippe Rochigneux<sup>9<\/sup>, Anthony Gonçalves<sup>6<\/sup>, Arnaud Foussat<sup>10<\/sup>, Anne-Sophie Chrétien<sup>1<\/sup>, Daniel Olive<sup>11<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Immunity and Cancer Team, Team Immunity and Cancer, Cancer Immunomonitoring Platform, Centre de Recherche en Cancérologie de Marseille (CRCM), Inserm, U1068, CNRS, UMR7258, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Aix-Marseille University, UM105, Marseille, France,<sup>2<\/sup>Alderaan Biotechnology, Paris, France,<sup>3<\/sup>Immunity and Cancer Team, Cancer Immunomonitoring Platform, Centre de Recherche en Cancérologie de Marseille (CRCM), Inserm, U1068, CNRS, UMR7258, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France,<sup>4<\/sup>Systems Biology Platform, Centre de Recherche en Cancérologie de Marseille (CRCM), Inserm, U1068, CNRS, UMR7258, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Aix-Marseille University, UM105, Marseille, France,<sup>5<\/sup>Cancer Immunomonitoring Platform, Centre de Recherche en Cancérologie de Marseille (CRCM), Inserm, U1068, CNRS, UMR7258, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France,<sup>6<\/sup>Department of Medical Oncology, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France,<sup>7<\/sup>Department of Clinical Research and Innovations, Institut Paoli-Calmettes,, Marseille, France,<sup>8<\/sup>Department of Pathology, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France,<sup>9<\/sup>Team Immunity and Cancer, Centre de Recherche en Cancérologie de Marseille (CRCM), Inserm, U1068, CNRS, UMR7258, Department of Medical Oncology, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Aix-Marseille University, UM105, Marseille, France,<sup>10<\/sup>Immunity and Cancer Team, Alderaan Biotechnology, Paris, France,<sup>11<\/sup>Immunity and Cancer Team, Team Immunity and Cancer, Cancer Immunomonitoring, PlatformCentre de Recherche en Cancérologie de Marseille (CRCM), Inserm, U1068, CNRS, UMR7258, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Aix-Marseille University, UM105, Marseille, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"32a8bcaa-3439-43b4-949a-217a57095a30","ControlNumber":"6810","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Neoadjuvant immunotherapy clinical trials facilitate understanding of the complexities of combination treatment strategies on immunosuppressive mechanisms. Our recent multi-omics analysis of a neoadjuvant trial comparing the GVAX vaccine alone or with nivolumab and supporting preclinical data uncovered crosstalk between CD8+CD137+ T cells and neutrophils as an axis for therapeutic intervention. These studies have formed the foundation for the addition of the CD137 agonist, urelumab, to our combination regimen to improve T cell activation in PDACs.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Patients were enrolled on NCT02451982 and initiated treatment 2 weeks prior to surgical resection. We compared specimens from 3 treatment arms for downstream analysis: Arm A: an allogeneic whole cell vaccine, GVAX (n=7); Arm B: GVAX and nivolumab (n=4); Arm C: GVAX, nivolumab, and urelumab (n=4). Samples underwent dissociation and Percoll separation to enrich for immune cells, followed by single-cell RNA- and TCR-seq using 10X Genomics. Computational analysis was performed for cell type classification with Seurat, differential expression with DESeq2 of pseudobulk data, cell-cell communication with Domino, and TCR-seq analysis with scRepertoire.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Single-cell RNA-seq analysis identified changes in immune cell proportions and immune cell states across treatment arms. Alignment of scTCR-seq to RNA data showed greater CD8+ T cell expansion following triple agent therapy. Gene set enrichment identified changes in CD8+ T cell, tumor associated macrophage (TAM), and B cell responses to cytokine signaling, locomotion, amino acid metabolism, and cell adhesion pathways in Arm C. Domino analysis demonstrated increases in the na&#239;ve T cell signal CCR7 in Arm A and integrin ligand signal ICAM1 in Arm C between the CD8+ T cells and other cell types present in PDACs. <i>CCR7<\/i> expression was significantly downregulated in CD8+ T cells in Arm C whereas <i>CCL5<\/i>, a T cell agonist cytokine, and <i>LCP2<\/i>, a TCR signaling activator and T cell receptor which is also required for integrin signaling, were significantly upregulated in CD8+ T cells in Arm C. The increased integrin ligand signaling via ICAM1 and LCP2 in Arm C is also associated with changes in CD8+ T cell motility observed from the differential expression analysis.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Analysis of combination GVAX, PD-1 inhibition and CD137 agonist therapy demonstrated changes in multiple immune cell proportions and their functional pathways.

Xenograft tumor models based on immunodeficient mice have been used for evaluating the human anti-tumor efficacy of ADCs. However, the antibody-mediated immune response of ADCs is not well evaluated in immunodeficient mice. To this end, we have developed BALB\/c-hPD1 humanized mouse model to evaluate the efficacy of ADCs in combination with immunotherapy.<br \/>Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd, DS-8201a) is a HER2-targeting ADC. <i>In vitro<\/i> efficacy studies showed that T-DXd effectively bound to the HER2-positive cell line SK-BR-3, resulting in strong endocytosis and induction of apoptosis. It has also been shown to kill HER2-negative MDA-MB-468 cells through a bystander effect both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy studies have demonstrated that ADCs can effectively inhibit human tumor cell growth in immunodeficient mice. In addition to human tumor cell lines, the efficacy of ADCs was also studied in BALB\/c-hPD1mice engrafted with murine colon cancer cells model, and the results showed that T-DXd and Keytruda could significantly inhibit CT26-hHER2 tumor growth, with the tumor growth inhibition rates being 57% and 66%, respectively, Tumor growth inhibition rate of the combined treatment group was about 91%, which was superior compared to the efficacy of single drug treatment. The evaluation of Fc segment-mediated effect (such as ADCC, CDC and ADCP) of ADCs antibodies was carried out in humanized immune system mouse models, such as NCG-hIL15 and NCG-hSGM3. In summary, we have established a drug evaluation platform using various humanized mouse models to study the synergistic anti-tumor effects of ADCs combined with immune checkpoint blockade antibodies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor,ADCs,Immune checkpoint,Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Fang Zhu<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Hongyan Sun<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Qian Lu<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuan Fang<sup>1<\/sup>, Jianming Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Cunxiang Ju<sup>1<\/sup>, Hongyu Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Santi Suryani Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Zhiying Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Mark Wade Moore<sup>2<\/sup>, Jing Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiang Gao<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>GemPharmatech Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China,<sup>2<\/sup>GemPharmatech LLC., La Jolla, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1d7d6d9f-00d2-4d29-be6a-2aa61dcaa1fd","ControlNumber":"4064","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

An accumulated body of evidence show that non-tumor cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME), specifically the brain microenvironment (BME), including tumor vasculature and immune stromal cells, such as astrocytes, microglia and pericytes, dictate the overall therapeutic efficacy. We synthesized a biodegradable, off-the-shelf and cost-effective nano-sized polymeric platform that combines a cancer vaccine with the targeted inhibition of molecular and\/or cellular immune suppressive players. These precision nano-sized medicines aim to re-educate and harness patient T-cell response against tumors, leading to an immunological memory able to control tumor relapse without any follow-up treatment. The design of these advanced peptide and RNA immunotherapeutics is guided by the identification of lead immune suppressor factors and tumor-specific antigens and proinflammatory cytokines using novel 3D bio-printed brain tumor-immune models developed in our lab. Using this unique model platform we identified P-selectin as a novel immune checkpoint in the brain regulating cancer cells-microglia and tumor-associated macrophages interactions. Combining a P-selectin inhibitor with our first nano-immunotherapy candidates sensitized brain malignancies mouse models to immune-checkpoint modulators, dramatically increasing disease-free survival rates.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Vaccines,Small molecule inhibitor,Glioblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Eilam Yeini<sup>1<\/sup>, Daniella Vaskovich-Koubi<sup>1<\/sup>, Ron Kleiner<sup>1<\/sup>, Helena  F.

Owing to the modest clinical efficacy of STING agonists, there is a need for other approaches for activating the cGAS-STING pathway for cancer immunotherapy. One such approach is through the inhibition of the enzyme ENPP1, a negative regulator of the STING pathway which directly hydrolyses 2&#8242;3&#8242;- cGAMP. <i>ENPP1<\/i> is overexpressed in several tumor cells like human astrocyte tumors and TNBC cells like 4T1 and MDA-MB-231, and plays a key role in tumor progression and block T cell infiltration in breast and lung cancer patients. ENPP1 not only abolishes the cGAS-STING mediated immune activation but also produces adenosine, an immune suppressor which promotes cell migration. AVA-NP-695 is a highly potent orally available ENPP1 inhibitor being developed for cancer immunotherapy.<br \/>Methods: The inhibition potency of AVA-NP-695 was confirmed by enzymatic assays using various substrate like p-Nitrophenyl-5&#8242;-TMP, cGAMP and ATP. The efficacy of AVA-NP-695 was depicted in 4T1 Tumor bearing BALB\/c mice as monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD-L1, Olaparib and Paclitaxel. Efficacy of AVA-NP-695 in combination with radiation (6.2Gy X 4) was also evaluated in ENPP1 overexpressing ANV5 tumors.<br \/>Results: Herein, we demonstrate that AVA-NP-695, a selective and potent ENPP1 inhibitor showed no adverse effect at 1000mg\/kg BID in 7 Day repeated dose in BALB\/C mice, thereby demonstrating an excellent therapeutic window&#8203;. Results from in vivo studies have shown superior tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and impact on tumor metastasis by AVA-NP-695 (6mg\/kg BID) compared to Olaparib and Anti-PD1 in a syngeneic 4T1 breast cancer mouse model. Subsequently, combination of AVA-NP-695 with Anti-PDL1,<br \/>Olaparib and Paclitaxel and demonstrated encouraging combinatorial efficacy of AVA-NP-695 along with Paclitaxel. Monotherapeutic arm for Paclitaxel and AVA-NP-695 depicted 40% and 44% TGI respectively, however their combined treatment resulted in ~60% TGI. Additionally, the AVA-NP-695 treatment alone showed 50% enhanced mean survival time followed by 68%, 68% and 72% when given in combination with anti-PD-L1, Olaparib and Paclitaxel respectively. Finally, AVA-NP-695 showed complete tumor ablation of ANV5 ENPP1 overexpressed tumors when given in combination with radiation. Combination group showed significantly delayed recurrence compared to only radiotherapy.<br \/>Conclusions: The potent anti-tumor efficacy of AVA-NP-695 both as monotherapy and combination along with its safety profile provides a strong rationale for the therapeutic potential of AVA-NP-695 against solids tumors, particularly breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Innate immunity,Small molecule inhibitor,Combination studies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Aditya Kulkarni<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Avijit Goswami<sup>2<\/sup>, Sandeep Goyal<sup>2<\/sup>, Princy Khurana<sup>2<\/sup>, Ishani Ghoshal<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Avammune Therapeutics, King of Prussia, PA,<sup>2<\/sup>Aten Porus Lifesciences, Bangalore, India","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"83ae72a1-8263-4d29-af8b-353044e382ef","ControlNumber":"788","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Mutations in the STK11 gene (STK11m) are present in ~ 20% of NSCLCs and are associated with poor response to chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) resulting in inferior survival outcomes. STK11m tumors are characterized by high oxidative stress\/ROS, EMT, enhanced replication stress tolerance, resistance to DNA damage and a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment with limited activation and expansion of anti-tumor CD8 T-cells. AXL, a member of the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases, is activated in response to cellular stress such as ROS and hypoxia. AXL expression and activation is associated with EMT and drug resistance, tumor tolerance towards oxidative stress and apoptosis, as well as an immunosuppressed tumor microenvironment.<br \/>We have previously shown that selective AXL inhibition by bemcentinib potentiated ICI in STK11m NSCLC preclinical models and led to objective clinical response in individuals with STK11m NSCLC receiving bemcentinib and pembrolizumab (NCT03184571). Data from this clinical study, an independent real-world cohort of patients studied at the Haukeland Hospital in Bergen, Norway (REC 45562) and published results<sup>1<\/sup>, suggest AXL is expressed in ~ 80% of NSCLCs harboring a STK11m, indicating AXL expression is a characteristic of STK11m NSCLC and confirming that AXL is an attractive target in STK11m NSCLC.<br \/>Inhibition of AXL in dendritic cells has been shown to increase ICI responses in preclinical models of STK11m NSCLC<sup>1<\/sup>. The relative contribution of targeting AXL in STK11m tumor cells vs the tumor microenvironment, and the impact on tumor cells after tumor cell targeting needs further exploration. Transcriptional analysis of STK11m and STK11wt sequences from public datasets, NCT03184571 patients and NSCLC cell lines identified transcriptional signatures consistent with the known roles of STK11 in DNA damage response and immunosuppression. Treatment of STK11m NSCLC cell lines with the AXL inhibitor bemcentinib led to a reduction in the STK11-associated DDR signature and increase in inflammatory signatures demonstrating the impact of AXL targeting on tumor cells.<br \/>Due to the high unmet medical need in individuals harboring a STK11 mutation, the encouraging efficacy in the NCT03184571 clinical trial and the high incidence of AXL protein expression in STK11m tumors, a global, open-label Phase 1b\/2a trial to determine the safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of bemcentinib with SOC (pembrolizumab, pemetrexed and carboplatin) in 1L advanced\/metastatic non-squamous NSCLC patients with STK11 mutations and no actionable mutations is currently enrolling. The Phase 1b part of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of bemcentinib regardless of STK11 status, whereas the Phase 2a part will assess the efficacy in NSCLC patients with STK11 mutations.<br \/><sup>1 <\/sup>Li <i>et al<\/i>., 2022; Cell Rep Med., PMID: 35492873","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Axl,LKB1,NSCLC,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Magnus Blø<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Austin Rayford<sup>1<\/sup>, Noëlly Madeleine<sup>1<\/sup>, Fabian Gärtner<sup>2<\/sup>, Dana Bohan<sup>3<\/sup>, Natalie Ruggio<sup>3<\/sup>, Huiyu Li<sup>4<\/sup>, Luc Girard<sup>5<\/sup>, Rolf Brekken<sup>4<\/sup>, John Minna<sup>6<\/sup>, Marianne Ånerud<sup>2<\/sup>, Wendy Maury<sup>3<\/sup>, Claudia Gorcea-Carson<sup>7<\/sup>, Gro Gausdal<sup>1<\/sup>, David  R.

As leading regulators of inflammation and tumor progression, tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) have gained major interest as immunotherapeutic targets in NB. Hence targeting or &#8220;re-educating&#8221; tumorigenic macrophages towards an immunostimulatory phenotype might improve responses to immunotherapy in this childhood cancer. Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) has recently been identified by our group as a novel immune-oncology target. We found that Syk is abundantly present in TAMs infiltrated in MYCN and non-MYCN amplified neuroblastoma tumors. Furthermore, genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of Syk markedly impaired neuroblastoma tumor growth. This effect was facilitated by macrophages that became immunogenic in the absence of Syk, skewing the suppressive tumor microenvironment towards immunostimulation and activating antitumor immune responses. Moreover, combining Syk inhibitor, R788 along with anti-PDL1 mAb and radiation provided a synergistic effect leading to complete tumor regression and durable anti-tumor immunity in aggressive MYCN-and non-MYCN-driven murine neuroblastoma tumor models. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the importance of Syk inhibitor, R788, in enhancing the anti-tumor immune responses in NB and support the clinical evaluation of R788 either alone or together with radiation and immune check point inhibitors as a potential treatment strategy for NB.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Tumor associated macrophages,Neuroblastoma,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Deepak Rohila<sup><\/sup>, In Hwan Park<sup><\/sup>, Timothy Pham<sup><\/sup>, Riley Jones<sup><\/sup>, Pablo Tamayo<sup><\/sup>, Alice Yu<sup><\/sup>, Andrew Sharabi<sup><\/sup>, <b>Shweta Joshi<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"76257ae5-4043-4c53-8e6b-4988d946a6f5","ControlNumber":"2040","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

Immunosuppressive TAM activity is thought to underly resistance to PD-1\/PD-L1-targeted immune checkpoint inhibitors used for cancer therapy. Protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) is a rate-limiting enzyme central to the ER-stress response mechanism that transduces ER-stress signals in cells to regulate protein synthesis, cell death, and cell survival. We hypothesized that inhibition of PERK would improve responses to ICI therapy by reprogramming TAM from immunosuppressive to immunoactivating cells.<br \/>Methods: To investigate if ER-stress underlies resistance to PD-1\/PD-L1 targeted therapies, we utilized <i>ex vivo<\/i> assays to investigate ER-stress regulation of macrophage phenotype, and in vivo syngeneic murine models of melanoma growth, with HC-5404 (PERKi), a selective and potent first-in-human small molecule PERK inhibitor currently in a phase 1 clinical trial for solid tumors (NCT04834778).<br \/>Results: Treatment with PERKi sensitized &#945;PD-1\/PD-L1 mAb-resistant melanoma tumors (Y1.7\/YR1.7) to PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade with concomitant increase in tumor infiltrating leukocytes, T<sub>H<\/sub>1- reprogrammed TAM, and cytotoxic CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. In addition to tumor microenvironment changes by PERKi, gene expression analysis confirmed reprograming of the tumor microenvironment, marked by a relative increase in T<sub>H<\/sub>1-associated genes and downregulation of T<sub>H<\/sub>2-associated genes when compared with untreated tumors. We utilized an <i>ex vivo<\/i> macrophage-splenocyte co-culture assay to depict macrophage dependent T cell suppression prevalent in tumors. This revealed that treating macrophages with PERKi prior to co-culturing with T cells or adding PERKi to the macrophage-T cell co-culture relieved macrophage dependent T cell suppression, illustrating a potential mechanism of therapeutic efficacy. We are now studying how ER-stress is regulated in TAMs and are focusing on identifying components of PERK-dependent cell signaling that increases the tumor promoting behavior of TAMs.<br \/>Conclusions: The combination therapy targeting PERK and PD-1\/PD-L1 signaling increased adaptive immune responses, reprogramed TAMs and reduced tumor growth kinetics. Results from these studies highlight a role for ER-stress signaling in TAMs to maintain an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and demonstrate the potential therapeutic strategy of PERK inhibition in &#945;PD-1\/PD-L1 resistant tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,PERK,Endoplasmic reticulum stress,PD-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sushil Kumar<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Michael McCane<sup>1<\/sup>, Jeremy Drees<sup>2<\/sup>, Nandita Bose<sup>2<\/sup>, Lisa Coussens<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Cell, development, and Cancer Biology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR,<sup>2<\/sup>Hibercell, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b84755e7-d971-403e-b63b-4bc26c65ade3","ControlNumber":"3946","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

Herein we evaluated the longitudinal pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of epcoritamab in clinical trial patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treated as monotherapy (EPCORE NHL-1: NCT03625037) and in combination with SOC therapies (EPCORE NHL-2: NCT04663347).<br \/>Methods: Patients with relapsed\/refractory (R\/R) DLBCL from EPCORE NHL-1 expansion phase received subcutaneous epcoritamab administered in 28-d cycles. Patients with newly diagnosed or R\/R DLBCL from EPCORE NHL-2 received epcoritamab administered with a dosing schedule similar to that in EPCORE NHL-1, in combination with SOC therapies: R-CHOP, R-DHAX\/C and GemOx. Biomarkers in fresh whole blood were assessed using validated flow cytometry assays. Cytokine levels in plasma were tested using a validated multiplex immunoassay.<br \/>Results: Epcoritamab monotherapy induced rapid (within the first cycle), sustained depletion of circulating peripheral B cells (CD19<sup>+<\/sup>) in patients with detectable peripheral B cells at baseline. A similar pattern of peripheral B-cell depletion was observed for epcoritamab in combination with SOC. Approximately 24 h following the first full dose, epcoritamab monotherapy induced a moderate but transient elevation of circulating cytokines IFN&#947;, IL-6 and IL-10. These cytokine patterns were similar for epcoritamab in combination with SOC. Within the first 8 wk of dosing, both epcoritamab monotherapy and in combination with SOC induced a transient elevation of percentages of peripheral CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells expressing proliferation (Ki67) and activation (HLA-DR) markers. Expansion of peripheral CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and their effector memory subsets was observed with epcoritamab monotherapy, as well as in combination with SOC in later cycles. Peripheral CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells demonstrated patterns similar to most of the biomarker observations in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells with epcoritamab as monotherapy and in combination.<br \/>Conclusion: These biomarker analyses show that the PD characteristics of epcoritamab monotherapy are maintained overall in combination with SOC therapies containing chemotherapeutic agents with or without rituximab and support the ongoing clinical studies investigating the combination of epcoritamab with SOC therapies in patients with DLBCL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,Chemotherapy,Bispecific antibody,Epcoritamab,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jimin Zhang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Han Si<sup>1<\/sup>, Monica Wielgos-Bonvallet<sup>1<\/sup>, David Soong<sup>1<\/sup>, Edith Szafer-Glusman<sup>1<\/sup>, Herve Ghesquieres<sup>2<\/sup>, Chan Y.

In this study, we set out to evaluate the hypothesis that circulating cytokines and peripheral white blood cell composition may predict response to therapy.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We quantified cytokines and complete blood counts from 89 patients with advanced melanoma treated with combination therapy from three points in time: pre-treatment, one month and approximately three months after starting therapy.

The ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes (NLR) pre-treatment was not associated with response, but higher NLR one month after starting therapy predicted poorer progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), primarily driven by an increase in absolute lymphocytes. A multivariate model demonstrated that baseline CXCL6, IL10, IL23 were independent predictors of therapy response, and the combined model has reached an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8 in prediction of response to combination therapy. Low IL10 and CXCL6 identified an excellent prognosis group, while high CXCL6 and low IL23 characterized a very poor prognosis group of patients.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Baseline measurement of cytokines IL23, CXCL6, and IL10 can predict metastatic melanoma patients&#8217; response to ipi\/nivo combination treatment. Higher neutrophils-to-lymphocytes ratio approximately one month after therapy started associates with worse survival outcome.

CD38, an ecto-enzyme involved in NAD+ catabolism, is upregulated in dysfunctional\/exhausted CD8+ T cells in human melanoma. As enrichment of dysfunctional CD8+ T cells is associated with lack of response to ICB, and NAD+ depletion via enhanced CD38 activity has been associated with diminished immune response, we hypothesized that CD38 might represent an attractive target to overcome resistance to ICB. While CD38 blockade has been shown to augment response to ICB in murine tumor models, the specific role of CD38 signaling in CD8 T cell exhaustion, and the therapeutic relevance of CD38 in human cancer have not been defined. Here, we confirm and extend previous observations that CD38 is enriched in exhausted CD8+ T cells during tumor progression and in response to ICB. Further, we demonstrate that disrupting CD38 signaling via neutralizing antibodies or pharmacological inhibition enhances response to ICB using established murine tumor models and patient-derived tumor explant models. Notably, we observed 54% response rate to combination PD-1\/CD38 blockade using a cohort (n=35) of patient-derived organotypic tumor spheroids (PDOTS) from patients with ICB-refractory melanoma (11.4% response rate to single-agent PD-1 blockade). Supplementation of nicotinamide riboside (NR) to boost NAD+ levels mimicked the effects CD38 blockade\/inhibition on PD-1 response, whereas FK866, an inhibitor of NAMPT a key step in NAD+ biosynthesis, blunted the response to combined PD-1\/CD38 blockade, suggesting a major role for NAD+ in the efficacy of CD38 blockade\/inhibition. Lastly, we demonstrate that <i>in vitro<\/i> CD38 inhibition\/blockade in CD8+ T cells increases the levels of TCF7 (an effector\/memory T cell transcription factor), decreases surface expression of co-inhibitory receptors (e.g., TIM-3, CD39, PD-1), and improves effector CD8 T cell function. Taken together, these data confirm a role for CD38 in CD8+ T cell exhaustion in melanoma and support further pre-clinical and clinical development of this novel therapeutic strategy to enhance anti-tumor immune responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Melanoma\/skin cancers,CD38,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Or-Yam Revach<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Angelina  M.

However, inhibition of GSK-3&#946; has emerged as a potentially promising therapy that could be of great benefit to pediatric and adult sarcoma patients. Saos-2 osteosarcoma and 93T449 liposarcoma cell lines were pretreated at IC50<sub>72<\/sub> with small molecule GSK-3&#946; inhibitor 9-ING-41 (elraglusib). The cells were harvested for western blot analysis after 48 hours of treatment. Additionally, both cancer cell lines as well as TALL-104 T-cells and NK-92 NK cells were treated with 0.5 &#956;M 9-ING-41 for 24 hours and harvested for Luminex cytokine profiling. The western blots demonstrated an increase in cPARP, an apoptotic marker, in both cancer cell lines after 9-ING-41 treatment. Additionally, an increase in PD-L1 expression was observed. The cytokine analysis revealed stimulation of immune cell activity in response to 9-ING-41. Treated T-cells had an increase in CXCL11, which is associated with T-cell recruitment, as well as an increased level of IL-18, which is shown to induce increased IFN-&#947; in Th1 cells. Additionally, NK-92 cells demonstrated an increase in IL-8 chemokine and an increase in soluble TRAIL (TRAIL\/TNFSF10). The cancer cell lines showed a homogenous increase in growth factor TGF-&#593;, however, only the Saos-2 osteosarcoma cell line demonstrated an increase of IL-6. We are further validating the data with follow-up cytokine profiling. The increase in immunostimulatory cytokines as well as the increased expression of PD-L1 suggest a rationale for combining 9-ING-41 with immune checkpoint blockade therapy. The potential synergistic effect of these two therapies is currently under investigation with co-culture experiments of sarcoma and immune cells. The treatment cohorts for these experiments include 9-ING-41 combined with either anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-1, or anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitors. Our results suggest a promising combination therapeutic strategy for patients with soft tissue and bone sarcomas and future work will strive to better elucidate the mechanisms of efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Glycogen synthase kinase-3,Immune checkpoint blockade,Pediatric cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>William  J.

The median progression-free survival (mPFS) of standard Stupp regimen was about 6.9 months. The 2-THE-TOP study suggested that a triple regimen of temozolomide (TMZ) combined with pembrolizumab and Tumor treating fields (TTFields) could further prolong the mPFS of newly diagnosed GBM to 12.1 months. Here we report a case showing long PFS from this triple regimen. In October 2019, a 60-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital due to intermittent dizziness and headache with rapid progression of left limb weakness for more than 10 days. MRI showed a space-occupying lesion in the basal ganglia of the right temporal lobe, with obvious peritumoral edema involving the basal ganglia, posterolateral thalamus, and cerebral foot, with midline shift, demonstrating a high-grade glioma. Total resection of the tumor was performed on October 30, 2019. Pathological diagnosis was glioblastoma, IDH wild type, WHO grade 4. Next generation sequencing showed negative MGMT promoter methylation, TERT promoter mutation, PTEN mutation, CDK4 and EGFR amplification. TMZ concurrent chemoradiotherapy was initiated on November 19, 2019, followed by triple regimen of TMZ adjuvant chemotherapy (200mg\/m2), pembrolizumab (200mg VD q3w) and TTFields in March 2020. During this period, the compliance of TTFields remained above 92%, which means the daily duration of TTFields was above 22.08 hours. Regular MRI review showed that the intracranial condition was stable, and there was no interruption of treatment due to treatment-related adverse reactions. No progression was found in the MRI reexamination in April 2022 but TTFields and TMZ chemotherapy were subsequently discontinued for the patient&#8217;s personal reasons, however, pembrolizumab monotherapy was maintained. In July 2022 she was hospitalized due to hemiplegia and the tumor recurrence was revealed in MRI, indicating a PFS of 33 months. She underwent tumor resection again and was histologically diagnosed as recurrent GBM on August 2,2022. After surgery, electric field therapy and immunotherapy were resumed. The patient was well recovered with a stable disease at the time of submitting this abstract. This patient had multiple negative prognostic factors of GBM.

The patient maintained TTFields for nearly 2 years, and tumor recurrence occurred 3 months after discontinuation of TTFields, indicating that continuous use of TTFields take great importance on disease control.

In cancer, Tregs hamper antitumor immunosurveillance and may be a resistance mechanism to anti-PD-1 therapies. In preclinical cancer models, Treg depletion enhances antitumor cytotoxic immune responses, but systemic and persistent Treg removal can elicit immunopathology. Therapeutic strategies that selectively deplete highly suppressive activated intratumoral Tregs may avoid immune-related toxicities and amplify the activity of antitumor CD8 T cells during PD-1 blockade. CD30 is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily and is expressed by a subset of activated lymphocytes and various lymphomas. Here, transcriptomics and flow cytometry data from tumor and peripherally derived Tregs demonstrated CD30 is enriched on intratumoral Tregs. Among peripheral Tregs, CD30 expression was associated with an activated effector phenotype (FoxP3<sup>hi<\/sup>CD45RA<sup>-<\/sup>, fraction II). Further, treatment of dissociated NSCLC tumor spheroids with anti-PD-1 resulted in upregulated CD30 expression by Tregs but not intratumoral CD4 or CD8 T cells, which is consistent with Treg reactivation and supports CD30 as an activated Treg target. In vitro, CD30 expression on Tregs was dependent on signaling through the TCR and was significantly amplified by IL-2 and IL-15, suggesting CD30 may identify a subpopulation of activated antigen-specific Tregs. Brentuximab vedotin (BV) is an antibody-drug conjugate approved for clinical use in multiple types of lymphomas including cHL and PTCL. BV consists of a CD30-directed monoclonal antibody conjugated to the highly potent microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). The activity of BV in lymphomas is thought to primarily result from tumor-directed intracellular MMAE release leading to apoptosis, though multiple immunomodulatory effects of BV have also been suggested. We have demonstrated through in vitro and in vivo preclinical model systems of human T cell activation that BV can selectively deplete CD30-expressing Tregs, amplifying cytotoxic CD8 T cell expansion. These and Treg CD30 expression data motivated the clinical exploration of BV plus pembrolizumab in metastatic PD-1 refractory melanoma and NSCLC (NCT04609566). Consistent with preclinical data, preliminary biomarker analysis from these studies showed a small but significant decrease in Tregs (CD4<sup>+<\/sup>CD25<sup>+<\/sup>CD127<sup>low\/-<\/sup>) in peripheral blood after treatment with BV plus pembrolizumab. Further, limited on-treatment biopsies showed a trend toward increased intratumoral CD8:Treg (FoxP3) ratio in some patients receiving combination therapy. These data support the ongoing evaluation of BV in combination with PD-1 inhibitors in solid tumors and a potential additional mechanism of action for BV.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Regulatory T cells,PD-1,Combination studies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Bryan  M.

The standard treatment options are surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy using temozolomide. GBM is fast-growing, aggressive, and results in poor overall survival, approximately 40% in the first year and 17% in the second year. Hypoxia, the lack of sufficient oxygen in tissues, is the hallmark of GBM and can induce drug resistance and inhibit anti-tumor immune responses. Previous studies show that CDK inhibitors can destabilize HIF1, a key regulator of hypoxia induced apoptosis and p53 stabilization. Palbociclib, a potent oral inhibitor of CD4\/6, is undergoing clinical trials for GBM treatment. However, it was not an effective treatment for recurrent GBM when used as alone in a Phase II study. Thus, we are exploring the cytotoxicity of palbociclib in combination with an anti-PD1 drug pembrolizumab, which is proven to be highly effective in other cancer types. Preliminary studies use CellTitlerGLO viability assay to determine the IC50s for Palbociclib at 24, 48, and 72 hours in both normoxia and hypoxia conditions. Immune cell co-culture, comprising of GBM cell lines plus TALL104 human leukemia T cells, was used to determine the amount of tumor cell death with palbociclib, pembrolizumab and a combination at different time points in both normoxia and hypoxia conditions.

Regorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used for cancer treatment, was known to effectively inhibit angiogenesis and attenuate the activity of oncogene receptor hormones. Currently, regorafenib has been approved to treat various cancer with significant improvement. Though regorafenib show potential to penetrate blood brain barrier, the role of regorafenib in glioblastoma has not been elucidated. With the finding of central nervous lymphatic system, immune checkpoint inhibitor (programmed cell death protein-1 and its ligand) therapy has ongoing with clinical trial in GBM. The PD-L1 on tumor cells may interact with the PD-1 on T cells, and therefore inhibited the proliferation of T cells proliferate and finally cause the immune escape of tumor. While the therapeutic efficacy of using immune checkpoint inhibitor alone is still not significant enough for GBM; thus, it is necessary to find other suitable drugs for combination. Moreover, patient with low PD-L1 expression may not be able to administrate with anti-PD-L1 therapy. Therefore, identifying suitable combination reagent to regulate PD-L1 expression and to enhance efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy is important. Our experiment aims to explore whether regorafenib can increase the transcription of PD-L1 via regulating &#946;-catenin-related signal transduction, and thus enhancing the treatment efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1) on GBM. Here, we used GL-261 animal model to prove the regulation of regorafenib combined with anti-PD-L1. According to our data, regorafenib can inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis pattern in GBM cells. Further, regorafenib may induce PD-L1 expression via activating &#946;-catenin-related signaling; and therefore, increasing the targeting efficacy of anti-PD-L1 in GBM. Not only induce PD-L1 expression, regorafenib combined with anti-PD-L1 may also induce the accumulation of active cytotoxicity T lymphocytes (CD8<sup>+<\/sup>IFN-&#947;<sup>+<\/sup>) and reduce the accumulation of immunosuppressive cells, such as regulatory T cells (CD11b<sup>+<\/sup>Gr-1<sup>+<\/sup>) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (CD4<sup>+<\/sup>CD25<sup>+<\/sup>FOXP3<sup>+<\/sup>). In conclusion, our animal experiments suggested that regorafenib may effectively promote PD-L1 transcription in glioblastoma by up-regulating &#946;-catenin-related signaling, thereby increasing the therapeutic target efficacy and effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Regorafenib,Immune checkpoint blockade,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dai-Cheng Dong<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yu-Chiang Liu<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>China Medical University, Taichung City, Taiwan,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Radiation Oncology, Chang Bing Show Chwan Memorial Hospital, Changhua City, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bc724335-2cab-4b7b-8382-6eae10332a2e","ControlNumber":"5767","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

One mechanism of intrinsic resistance is the presence of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and dysfunctional dendritic cells in the metastatic tumor microenvironment (TME) that impede the activation of anti-tumor T cells. A comparison of single-cell RNA sequencing analyses between breast-to-lung metastases and published data from breast tumors in the syngeneic NeuN mouse model of HER2+ breast cancer revealed that despite the presence of additional immune cell populations in the lungs, myeloid cells represented the predominant immune cell population in both TMEs and demonstrated similar changes in frequency and gene expression following treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, entinostat. Our work highlights for the first time an increase in the frequency of conventional dendritic cells (cDC) with entinostat treatment in breast-to-lung metastases. Gene expression analyses of breast-to-lung metastases showed that entinostat-treated myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) downregulated genes associated with immunosuppression such as <i>S100a8<\/i>, <i>Cd84<\/i>, <i>Trem2<\/i>, and <i>Mmp9<\/i>. In addition, TAMs and cDCs upregulated the expression of genes associated with antigen presentation such as <i>H2-K1<\/i>, <i>H2-Ab1<\/i>, <i>B2m<\/i>, and <i>Cd74<\/i> and pro-inflammatory markers such as <i>Ccl3<\/i>. NeuN mice were treated with the combination of entinostat and the immune checkpoint inhibitors, anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4, and breast-to-lung metastases were analyzed via flow cytometry, demonstrating an increase in the frequency of cDC1s and CD8+ T cells expressing granzyme B. Furthermore, the treatment combination of entinostat + anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4 significantly increased survival in an experimental model of lung metastasis using a newly characterized model derived from the original NT2.5 HER2+ cell line, NT2.5LM. These results confirm those of our breast expansion cohort from the phase I clinical trial NCI-9844 that demonstrate a 30% overall response rate in 20 heavily pretreated patients with metastatic disease treated with entinostat + Nivolumab (anti-PD-1) + Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4). We highlight for the first time significant alterations within multiple myeloid derived cell types, cDCs, TAMs and MDSCs, from within a native metastatic niche, that are likely driving an entinostat mediated improved response to ICI treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Immune checkpoint blockade,Histone deacetylase inhibitor,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Edgar Gonzalez<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Adam L.
