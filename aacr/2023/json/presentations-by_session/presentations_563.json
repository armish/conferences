The ADC is engineered to have 3 distinct mechanisms of action to maximize anti-cancer activity while reducing systemic toxicities: (1) targeted GRM payload delivery, (2) signaling inhibition of CD19\/BCR and (3) enhanced ADCC via afucosylation. Unlike traditional cytotoxic ADCs, the GRM payload is a high potency agonist (sub nM EC50) of the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor (GR) which then traffics to the nucleus resulting in sustained GR-driven transcriptional events leading to cancer cell death. CD19 is a clinically validated B-cell target (approved antibodies, ADCs, CARTs) known to be highly expressed even following multiple lines of therapy, making it an appropriate target for this novel approach. The CD19 antibody in ABBV-319 is an optimized high affinity IgG1 that can inhibit CD19\/BCR downstream signaling events including AKT, leading to inhibition of growth in certain B-cell lines. Given ADCC\/ADCP is a highly effective mechanism in B-cell malignancies (<i>e.g.<\/i>, rituximab, tafasitamab) the CD19 antibody was engineered to have increased Fc&#947;R binding via afucosylation, that retains its enhanced ADCC activity as a GRM drug conjugate. By engineering the molecule in this way, the multi-modal ADC is not solely reliant on one mechanism of action for activity and therefore has the potential for broader activity. Sustained regressions\/cures have been observed in multiple B-cell malignancy xenograft model systems (cell-line, PDX, humanized) after a single ADC dose that compares favorably against approved benchmark antibodies, systemic steroids and ADCs. ABBV-319 targets clinically validated mechanisms of action that are known to combine well with multiple standard-of-care agents. This combination potential together with its favorable safety profile, suggests ABBV-319 will be a highly effective combination treatment for B-cell malignancies. ABBV-319 was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkey studies with favorable drug-like properties and antibody-like pharmacokinetics, enabling a high mg\/kg clinical starting dose. A first in-human Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating ABBV-319 in B-cell malignancies (DLBCL, FL, CLL) was recently initiated in late 2022 (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT05512390).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),CD19,Glucocorticoid,ADCC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>James W.

CRISPR Therapeutics&#8217; first generation allo CAR T cell products, CTX110&#174; (CD19-directed) and CTX130<sup>TM<\/sup> (CD70-directed), have shown encouraging efficacy in ongoing clinical trials (NCT04035434, NCT04502446, NCT04438083), including complete and durable responses in B- and T-cell lymphoma and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, T cell exhaustion, occurring even prior to CAR T cell clearance by the immune system, can result in diminished efficacy and loss of response, especially in patients with high tumor burden. To address this challenge, we performed a CRISPR screen to discover potency edits to incorporate into next-generation CAR T programs. Herein, we describe two novel allo CAR T cell therapies, CTX112<sup>TM<\/sup> and CTX131<sup>TM<\/sup>, that incorporate the synergistic potency edits Regnase-1 and TGFBR2. CTX112 (CD19-directed) and CTX131 (CD70-directed) are produced from healthy donor T cells modified <i>ex vivo <\/i>using CRISPR\/Cas9 gene editing. Regnase-1 and TGFBR2 have been added to edits in our first-generation programs: <i>TRAC<\/i> (T-cell receptor to prevent GvHD), <i>B2M<\/i> (MHC class I to reduce T-cell mediated rejection), and <i>CD70<\/i> (to eliminate fratricide and increase potency), and site-specific CAR insertion at the <i>TRAC<\/i> locus using an AAV template. These modifications result in next-generation CAR-T therapies that have demonstrated increased potency, prolonged persistence, and sustained antitumor activity. Disruption of Regnase-1 improves functional persistence by increasing cellular expansion potential, correlating with central memory phenotype. TGFBR2 disruption allows CAR T cells to avoid tumor microenvironment suppression. In combination, these edits increase potency at least 10-fold. In addition, long-term maintenance of CM phenotype enables efficient manufacturing. CTX112 and CTX131 demonstrated increased expansion, resistance to exhaustion, and elevated effector cytokine release when tested using <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> models. CTX112 increased survival and tumor regression in CD19+ Nalm6-Luciferase leukemia and Jeko-1 lymphoma models relative to control CAR T cells with only Regnase-1 or TGFBR2 disruption. Similarly, in a &#8220;rechallenge model&#8221; in which xenografts were serially implanted following a single dose of CAR T cells, CTX131 caused complete regression of NCI-H1975 lung, A498 RCC, and Caki-2 RCC tumors. No evidence of clonal expansion nor cytokine independent growth occurred, suggesting multiplex edited CTX112 and CTX131 cells are safe for clinical use. In summary, CTX112 and CTX131 are the first CAR T programs to incorporate novel Regnase-1 and TGFBR2 edits, with the potential to increase expansion and functional persistence, which may translate clinically to deeper, more durable responses. CTX112 will be developed in patients with B cell malignancies, and CTX131 will be developed in patients with advanced solid tumors, including RCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT01-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,CD70,CD19,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jonathan A.

The androgen receptor (AR) plays critical roles in both early disease and advanced prostate cancer. Current therapeutic approaches targeting the androgen\/AR axis are initially effective, but castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) inevitably develops. CRPC is linked with increased AR activity via gene overexpression, amplification, and gain-of-function mutations. To address these mechanisms of AR-dependent prostate tumor growth, we have developed a novel therapeutic agent, ARV-766, a proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC<sup>&#174;<\/sup>) that induces a protein-protein interaction between the AR and specific E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, leading to the ubiquitination of AR and its subsequent degradation via the proteasome. In vitro, ARV-766 degrades AR in various prostate cancer cell lines, including those harboring resistance-conferring, clinically relevant point mutations, with a half-maximal degradation concentration (DC<sub>50<\/sub>) of &#60;1 nM in wild type VCaP. Importantly ARV-766 also maintains potency against the AR L702H mutant, which has been associated with resistance to some AR antagonists. In vivo, ARV-766 is orally bioavailable and robustly degrades AR with a &#62;90% observed maximum degradation (Dmax) at efficacious doses. ARV-766 significantly and dose-dependently inhibits tumor growth in murine LNCaP and VCaP xenograft models, including an enzalutamide-insensitive non-castrated VCaP model. These preclinical data supported the clinical development of ARV-766 for the treatment of men with metastatic CRPC. Selected pre-clinical data along with the chemical structure of ARV-766 will be presented.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Androgen receptor,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Larry Snyder<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>S H.

Diacylglycerol kinase zeta (DGK-&#950;) is a lipid kinase that can down-modulate T-cell activation by catalyzing the conversion of DAG to phosphatidic acid, thereby acting as a ligand independent, intracellular immune checkpoint. Inhibition of DGK- &#950; offers the potential to enhance T cell priming against suboptimal tumor antigens and to overcome multiple immune-suppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment.<br \/>Bayer AG in collaboration with the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) have developed BAY 2965501, a highly selective, orally available DGK-&#950; inhibitor which shows a unique binding mode and good DMPK profile. The compound enhances the reactivity of human and mouse T-cells, both in the priming and the effector phase, and overcomes the inhibitory impact of suppressive factors, such as adenosine and prostaglandin E2. Oral dosing of BAY 2965501 shows T cell dependent efficacy in syngeneic, murine tumor models. Furthermore, this results in reactivation of exhausted T cells <i>in vivo.<\/i> Preclinical safety studies showed only mild findings, so that good clinical tolerability is expected. Collectively, the preclinical data support first in human (FiH) phase I testing of therapeutic potential.<br \/>A FiH trial with BAY 2965501 in patients with advanced solid tumors including NSCLC, gastric\/GEJ AdCa, ccRCC, and melanoma patients, is currently enrolling patients <i>(NCT05614102).<\/i> This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated or administered dose, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tumor response profile of BAY 2965501.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-08 Immunomodulatory agents and interventions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Small molecule inhibitor,Immunotherapy,T cell,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Rienk Offringa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Catherine Olesch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frederik Cichon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mareike Grees<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Norbert Schmees<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ulrike Roehn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Florian Prinz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Judith Guenther<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Detlef Stoeckigt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Erkelenz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thi Thanh Uyen Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ulf Boemer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolas Werbeck<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marc Kunze<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kirstin Petersen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Dennis Kirchhoff<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
