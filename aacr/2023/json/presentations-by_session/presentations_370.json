[{"Abstract":"Mutant BRAF, one of the most frequently mutated serine\/threonine kinase, drives tumorigenesis via activating MAPK signaling across various tumor types. Expanded genomic and mechanistic studies over the past two decades have revealed the heterogeneity regarding BRAF mutation status and characterized a classification system for BRAF mutations based on their mode of action. Class I (V600 mutants) and class II (K601 mutants, G469A\/V\/R, etc) BRAF mutants function as RAS-independent active monomers or dimers to amplify MAPK signaling, whereas class III (G466 mutants, D594 mutants, G469E, etc) mutants, which are kinase impaired or dead, promote MAPK signaling via enhanced RAS binding and subsequent CRAF activation. To date, combination therapies of BRAF and MEK inhibitors have been approved for treatment of patients harboring class I BRAF mutations, while viable therapeutic options for those with class II and III BRAF mutations are still ambiguous. Therefore, developing new drugs and personalized therapeutic strategies directing different classes of BRAF mutations, especially class II and III subtypes, have become vital in the war against BRAF-mutant tumors. To enable BRAF-targeted drug discovery and precision medicine, we developed a tailored platform based on the classification of BRAF mutations, which integrates whole exome sequencing (WES) for identification of mutant BRAF subtypes with <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy evaluation in patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) models. Our platform covers all three classes of BRAF mutants, such as V600E\/G469A\/D594N\/G469E. Moreover, this platform faithfully recapitulate the responses of multiple targeted therapies, such as BRAF, MEK and EGFR inhibitors, reported for treating BRAF-mutant tumors in preclinical and clinical studies, highlighting the potential translation values. Taken together, the platform reported in this study empowers the discovery of novel BRAF inhibitors that can be translated into clinical trials and provides personalized therapeutic options for patients who have poorly responded to standard clinical therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRAF,MEK inhibitor,Targeted therapy,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Hui Qi<sup><\/sup>, Fuyang Wang<sup><\/sup>, Bingrui Han<sup><\/sup>, Xiaomin Wang<sup><\/sup>, <b>Xiangnan Qiang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Zhixiang Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Qingyang Gu<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>WuXi AppTec, Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a70d2a0e-64da-4fef-8d2c-01566e465545","ControlNumber":"5726","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;H.

The CDK12\/cyclin K complex regulates the elongation step of RNA transcription by phosphorylating Ser2 on the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, and selectively affects the expression of genes, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, involved in DNA Damage Response (DDR). CDK12 mutations as well as overexpression have been reported in different types of malignancies, making it an attractive cancer target. In this study, a series of covalent CDK12 inhibitors were designed and profiled in biochemical and cellular assays. ISM6466A was identified as a lead compound, demonstrating good <i>in vitro<\/i> efficacy, ADME properties, safety pharmacology profile (e.g., CYP, hERG), and a reasonable <i>in vivo<\/i> PK profile. Biochemically, ISM6466A exhibited reasonable selectivity over other CDKs, and inhibited cell proliferation in a panel of tumor cell lines with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values in the nanomolar range (e.g., IC<sub>50<\/sub> of ~100nM in the TNBC and AML cell lines, SUM149PT and MV4-11, respectively). Cell-based assays showed that ISM6466A has a selective inhibitory action for the phosphorylation of Ser2 on the CTD, but not for that of Ser5 or Ser7. Notably, ISM6466A demonstrated excellent <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor efficacy in the SUM149PT breast cancer CDX model (Tumor Growth Inhibition, TGI, of 114% at 60 mg\/kg QD) and in the MV4-11 AML CDX model (TGI of 95% at 30 mg\/kg QD), without body weight loss. Data from an endpoint PKPD study in the MV4-11 CDX model revealed that ISM6466A inhibited phosphorylation of Ser2 on the CTD, and also inhibited DDR genes such as BRCA1 and ATR. Results from a 28-day rat DRF study revealed that the compound did not show evident signs of toxicity at the tested doses, suggesting a reasonable safety window for ISM6466A.In summary, the novel, covalent, small-molecule CDK12 inhibitor, ISM6466A, demonstrated excellent preclinical efficacy along with favorable drug-like properties. Our results underscore the therapeutic potential of ISM6466A for the treatment of cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK inhibitor,Small molecule inhibitor,Breast cancer,DNA damage response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Lihua Min<sup>1<\/sup>, Hongfu Lu<sup>1<\/sup>, Yihong Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Jianping Wu<sup>1<\/sup>, Xin Cai<sup>1<\/sup>, Min Zheng<sup>1<\/sup>, Hui Cui<sup>1<\/sup>, Junwen Qiao<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiao Ding<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Sujata Rao<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, Feng Ren<sup>1<\/sup>, Alex Zhavoronkov<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Insilico Medicine, Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Insilico Medicine, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c686ed66-181a-4724-a5f3-1d4a68f70857","ControlNumber":"3248","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;L.

Mutation in MAPK pathway is common in many DMG tumors, however, has not been largely explored before. E6201 is a dual inhibitor of ACVR1 and MEK 1\/2. It is currently in a phase 1 clinical trial for BRAF\/MEK mutant melanoma. E6201 achieves higher levels in brain compared to other MEK inhibitors, suggesting it might be a promising therapeutic option for DMG. Previously, E6201 was effective in DMG cell lines with ACVR1 mutation, such as HSJD007. We have evaluated the effect of E6201 in two MAP kinase pathway activated, novel DMG cell lines, DIPG2JA and JHH-DIPG17. DIPG2JA has a <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation, leading to upregulation of MAPK pathway, and JHH-DIPG17 has two <i>NF1 <\/i>alterations predicted to disrupt this tumor suppressor, resulting in activation of MAPK pathway. Treatment of DIPG2JA with E6201 identified an IC50 of 44 nM, which is comparable to an IC50 of 71nM in the ACVR1 mutant DMG HSJD007. E6201 suppressed phospho&#8212;ERK and induced apoptosis as measured by cPARP western blot in DMG cells. Evaluation of cell viability by CellTiterBlue viability assay demonstrated that E6201 suppressed DMG growth between 0.05uM to 1uM concentrations. (DIPG2JA p=0.0004, JHH-DIPG17 p&#60;0.0001 by <i>t-test <\/i>compared to control). Compensatory upregulation of mTOR pathway is often associated with downregulation of MAPK pathway, and we hypothesized that E6201 will synergize with a PI3K\/mTOR inhibitor to induce DMG cell death. We selected the brain-penetrant PI3K\/mTOR inhibitor paxalisib, because this drug is currently being tested in early phase clinical trials for DMG. Through CellTiterBlue cell viability assay, we showed that E6201 synergizes with paxalisib to inhibit cell growth. The ZIP synergy scores were 13.1 for HSJD007 and 12.7 for DIPG2JA according to the SynergyFinder program, suggesting synergistic interaction between E6201 and paxalisib. In <i>vitro <\/i>experiments for further evaluation of the combination treatment of E6201 and paxalisib are underway and in vivo studies are pending. From our data, E6201 as a single agent is a promising therapeutic option for DMG. With further evaluation of combination of E6201 and paxalisib, we believe that combination therapy will be an even more effective treatment option for DMG.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MEK inhibitor,PI3K,Glioma,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hyuk Jean Kwon<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Abigail Tindall<sup>1<\/sup>, Charles Eberhart<sup>2<\/sup>, Jeffrey Rubens<sup>1<\/sup>, Eric Raabe<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Pediatric Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD,<sup>2<\/sup>Neuropathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e3a4e338-a33d-472f-a261-24da56732084","ControlNumber":"5643","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

The role of MERTK in cancer progression and resistance to therapies are reported in many cancer types, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In canonical signaling, MERTK is localized at the cell membrane and mediates intracellular signal transduction pathways. Non-canonical signaling of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) has been reported, including signaling which occurs when RTKs translocate to the nucleus. Our group previously reported nuclear localization of MERTK in leukemia cells and we now extend these findings to non-small cell lung cancer. We found exogenous MERTK localized to the nucleus in cells transfected with a plasmid expressing wild-type MERTK. Additionally, endogenous nuclear MERTK was phosphorylated, suggesting that MERTK may have a functional role in the nucleus. MERTK kinase inhibitor MRX-2843 modulates its nuclear translocation. Introducing point mutations to MERTK autophosphorylation sites diminished nuclear translocation in comparison to cells transfected with wild-type MERTK. Our analysis of proteins that may interact with MERTK to regulate nuclear localization and function demonstrated co-immunoprecipitation of nuclear MERTK and STAT1.

Currently, a number of BRD4 inhibitors or degraders have been discovered. However, recent studies revealed that <i>SPOP<\/i> mutant of prostate cancer patients leads to BRD4 stabilization and resulted in JQ1-resistant. Therefore, to reveal the mechanism underlying BRD4 stability may improve the clinical response rate and efficacy of BRD4-targeted therapy in PCa patients.<br \/>Methods: To evaluate the level of BRD4 during the mitosis phase, we applied a Confocal microscope and WB. <i>In vitro<\/i> kinase assay and Mass spectrometry were applied to test the phosphorylation of BRD4 by PLK1. A homemade phosphorylation-specific antibody was used to verify p-BRD4 in PCa cells and a tissue micro-array. A PDX-tumor model was used to evaluate the combination efficacy of Taxol to overcome JQ1-resistant.<br \/>Result: We found that the level of BRD4 obviously decreased during the mitosis phase of PCa cells. Upon releasing from M-phase arrest, BRD4 level increased along with PLK1 decreasing in PCa cell lines, suggesting PLK1 might be involved in the degradation of BRD4 in the M-phase. We found that PBD domain of PLK1 was responsible for interacting with CTD of BRD4. Enforced overexpression of PLK1 promoted BRD4 dramatically reduced. Reversely, tet-induced depletion or inhibition of PLK1 led to BRD4 stabilization. Furthermore, applying gain or loss of function assay, we found that PLK1 directly phosphorylated BRD4 and triggered its phosphorylation-dependent degradation in M-phase, which was confirmed in clinical samples that high level of PLK1 was negatively correlated with BRD4. Accordingly, we found that overexpression of PLK1 lowered the stabilized BRD4 caused by<i> SPOP <\/i>mutant in PCa cells and consequently made cells sensitive to JQ1. Intriguingly, upon treated with Taxol, a commonly used medicine for PCa patients, PLK1 level was dramatically elevated as well as p-BRD4 status but total BRD4 downregulated in PCa cells. Moreover, sequential treatment of Taxol and JQ1 resulted in significant inhibition of proliferation, colony formation, and PDX tumor carrying <i>SPOP <\/i>mutant, indicating application of Taxol overcame JQ-1 resistant.<br \/>Conclusion: Collectively, our results suggested that PLK1 phosphorylates BRD4 and consequently triggers its phosphorylation-dependent degradation in PCa cells.

This kinase is overexpressed and upregulated in cancer cells, making it an attractive target for&nbsp;therapeutics. Drug discovery efforts have mainly focused on the ATP binding site however have met with little clinical success to date. Targeting substrate recognition and subcellular localization through the Polo-Box domain represents an attractive alternative to generating PLK1 specific compounds and to avoid the tumor suppressor functions of PLK3. REplacement with Partial Ligand Alternatives through Computational Enrichment, REPLACE, is validated strategy used to convert peptide inhibitors of protein-protein interactions into more drug like compounds. Through the use of this methodology, we have discovered promising non-ATP competitive inhibitors based on a 2-(4-AlkylBenzamido) Benzoic Acid (ABBA) pharmacophore which bind to the polo-box domain of PLK1. These compounds, designated as abbapolins, engage PLK1 as evidenced by their ability to block phosphorylation of TCTP, a key substrate of PLK1, induce PLK1 degradation and are potently anti-proliferative in prostate cancer cell lines. Based on these observations, lead compounds were investigated further for their pharmacokinetic properties and <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy and key compounds showed development potential based upon preliminary results. To further investigate their potential in other tumors, selected abbapolins were tested against the NCI-60 tumor cell panel and other cancers with poor prognosis. Results indicate that neuroblastoma, lung, colorectal and certain leukemias are the most sensitive cell lines and thus provide impetus to investigate the abbapolins for difficult to treat and resistant tumors. We present the further optimization of the abbapolins to determine their structure-activity relationship and identify compounds with novel structures and improved drug-like properties. This includes their ability to engage PLK1 and anti-proliferative activities against selected cell lines that represent therapeutically challenging cancers.

Recent improvements in targeted therapies have shown some benefit in patients with BRAF mutated metastatic CRC (mCRC), while several efforts focusing on KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors (alone or in combination) are being examined with outcomes pending. Immunotherapies have shown efficacy in only ~5% of patients with mCRC having MSI-H. Hence, it is important to utilize unbiased approaches in order to identify novel therapies that have the potential to improve the outcomes in a large proportion of patients with mCRC.<br \/>Aim: We aimed to perform high-throughput screening (HTS) using &#8220;pan-active&#8221; drugs to identify novel effective therapeutic combinations for patients with KRAS\/BRAF mutated mCRC.<br \/>Methods: We performed unbiased HTS with a set of 250 drugs that were either approved by the FDA or are currently in clinical trials. The effect of these drugs on cell growth inhibition were determined as single agents in 2D and 3D cultures using KRAS or BRAF mutated CRC cell lines. Drugs that decreased cell proliferation in both 2D and 3D cultures and effective in both HCT116 (KRAS mutated) and HT29 (BRAF mutated) cell lines, were termed as &#8220;pan-active&#8221; drugs. 57 &#8220;pan active&#8221; drugs were identified that primarily fall into 9 classes based on targets\/pathways they inhibit. Next, the efficacy of the top three candidate drugs from each class of &#8220;pan-active&#8221; drugs were determined by pairing with drugs of other classes to identify combinations that are most effective in inducing cell death in CRC cells. Using the Bliss model of synergy, BX-795 was identified to be synergistic with Crizotinib. Effects of combining BX-795 with Crizotinib were further validated <i>in vitro<\/i> by 1) cell growth assays, and 2) measuring changes in cell signaling pathways and apoptotic mediators by western blotting and flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: Pairwise HTS studies using &#8220;pan-active&#8221; drugs demonstrated that combining BX-795 with Crizotinib was synergistic in multiple CRC cell lines. This combination was further validated <i>in vitro<\/i> by MTT and colony formation assays. Analyses of markers for apoptosis by western blotting demonstrated that the drug combination increased cell death in multiple CRC cell lines as compared to single agents. Flow cytometry results using FITC Annexin V and PI confirmed that the combination increased apoptotic cell death in multiple CRC cell lines when compared to the monotherapies.<br \/>Conclusions: Our unbiased HTS along with <i>in vitro<\/i> validation studies demonstrated that the combination of BX-795 with Crizotinib can serve as a possible novel effective therapeutic combination in patients with mCRC. Our preclinical <i>in vitro<\/i> studies serve as the basis for <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy studies and future clinical studies in order to determine the efficacy of this drug combination in patients with mCRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"High-throughput assay,Combination therapy,Colorectal cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Susmita Ghosh<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Fan Fan<sup>1<\/sup>, Jason Roszik<sup>2<\/sup>, Reid Powell<sup>3<\/sup>, Yong Park<sup>3<\/sup>, Clifford Stephan<sup>3<\/sup>, Lee M.

Key transcription factors implicated as drivers of unique biological phenotypes of SCLC include ASCL1, NEUROD1, YAP1, and POU2F3. Strategies to exploit these phenotypes for innovative precision medicine approaches will be impactful. Using an unbiased agnostic preclinical drug screen to uncover therapeutic opportunities in SCLC, we identified a strong signal with PLK1 inhibitors (PLK1i) with low nanomolar IC50. We extended the <i>in vitro<\/i> findings by testing the efficacy of PLK1i <i>in vivo<\/i> using traditional xenograft of SCLC H526 cell line and patient derived xenografts (PDX). Volasertib achieved significant tumor growth inhibition relative to control in H526 xenografts. Also, onvansertib significantly inhibited growth of platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive PDXs. The combination of PLK1i with standard chemotherapeutic agents identified promising synergy of the combination of onvansertib and paclitaxel. We further interrogated for predictive biomarkers of PLK1i sensitivity using gene expression profile comparing highly sensitive to less sensitive cell lines. High expression of <i>C-MYC<\/i> but not <i>PLK1<\/i>, <i>TP53<\/i> or <i>RB<\/i> was associated with resistance to PLK1i. Conversely, while <i>TP53<\/i> expression level did not correlate, TP53 gene mutation status (inactivating disruptive mutations) correlated with cell sensitivity to PLK1i. We queried the publicly available CCLE and the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal to evaluate whether any of the SCLC subtypes have therapeutic vulnerability to PLK1i. In general, high expression of YAP1 in SCLC cell lines correlated with greater sensitivity to PLK1i. A YAP1 positive cell line, SW1271, with strong TP53 expression was particularly resistant to PLK1i. CRISPR knockout of YAP1 in this cell line enhanced SW1271 sensitivity to PLK1i suggesting that YAP1 expression as a marker of vulnerability to PLK1i could be context dependent especially when co-occurring with TP53 mutations. The mechanism of this interaction will be discussed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Polo-like kinase,Lung cancer: small cell,YAP1,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>John C.

We have previously discovered LCK driving signaling through AXL, a TAM receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), by phosphoproteomic analysis of CCA (<i>J Hepatol<\/i> 2022). AXL mediates acquired drug resistance in solid cancers. However, the exact role of AXL in CCA still remains to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the significance of AXL expression as a potential therapeutic target in CCA and the role of phosphorylated AXL Y866.<br \/>Methods: We first evaluated the expression levels of AXL in CCA and its associations with patient outcomes using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Next, to evaluate whether AXL inhibition sensitizes CCA cells to gemcitabine and cisplatin (GemCis) therapy, AXL downregulation was achieved via the siRNA approach and the selective inhibitor bemcentinib. We examined the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50<\/sub>) value of HuCCT1, a well-characterized CCA cell line, on GemCis therapy with or without AXL knockdown using cell viability assay. Then we assessed the efficacy of the combinatorial therapy of GemCis and bemcentinib utilizing Calcusyn software. Apoptosis was evaluated by Annexin V assay. I<i>n vivo <\/i>efficacy was assessed using an SB-1 (murine CCA cell line) and a syngeneic murine model of CCA treated with vehicle, GemCis, bemcentinib, and the combination of GemCis and bemcentinib. Finally, to investigate the role of AXL Y866 in CCA, we performed BioID to identify and compare the interactomes of AXL WT and AXL Y866F in HuCCT1 cells.<br \/>Results: In the TCGA cohorts, AXL is significantly expressed in CCA (P &#60; 0.01), and disease-free survival and overall survival in the low AXL expression group are significantly longer than those in the high AXL expression group (P = 0.04, 0.01). In <i>in vitro<\/i> study, the IC<sub>50<\/sub> value of GemCis was decreased from 685nM to 129nM after AXL knockdown. A synergistic effect was observed with CI = 0.17 and Fa = 0.50 in the combinatorial therapy. The combinatorial therapy caused significantly increased apoptosis compared to GemCis or bemcentinib alone (P &#60; 0.01, P &#60; 0.01). In <i>in vivo <\/i>study, the combinatorial therapy significantly suppressed the tumor growth compared to GemCis or bemcentinib alone (P = 0.04, 0.01), and the expression levels of Ki67 and the phosphorylation levels of PEAK1 decreased in the combinatorial therapy group compared to other groups in immunostaining examination. In BioID experiments, among the 222 proteins detected in both AXL WT and AXL Y866F interactomes, PEAK1 kinase, which localizes to actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions, was the kinase most affected by AXL Y866. In gene ontology analysis to characterize the interactome of AXL Y866, cell-cell adhesion and focal adhesion-related proteins were enriched.<br \/>Conclusions: AXL inhibition sensitizes CCA cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy in the preclinical model.

The survival rate of advanced melanoma patients will be exceedingly poor, as low as 27.3%. BRAF-V600E is the most common mutation found clinically, resulting in the constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Vemurafenib, a specific inhibitor of mutant BRAF, has shown an impressive response in phase 3 clinical trials and was approved by FDA in 2011. However, due to the rapid development of resistance, the duration of response under a single treatment is frequently short, highlighting the urgent requirement for novel therapy in melanoma treatment. Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a crucial cell cycle regulator, participates in multiple mitotic processes, including centrosome maturation, mitotic entry, spindle assembly, sister chromatid segregation, mitotic exit, and cytokinesis. Compared to normal tissues, the expression level of PLK1 significantly upregulates in multiple cancers. More importantly, the expression level of PLK1 negatively correlates with the melanoma patients&#8217; survival rate based on the TCGA database. Besides, PLK1 is identified as an oncogene to promote proliferation, motility, and resistance to various drugs. In the present study, we found that overexpression of PLK1 promotes tumor growth, metastasis, metabolic reprogramming, and vemurafenib resistance in the Braf<sup>CA<\/sup>\/Pten<sup>loxp<\/sup> mouse melanoma model. Through phosphorylation, overexpressed PLK1 stabilizes BACH1, a critical transcriptional factor of multiple metastatic and metabolic genes, and protects it from degradation. Subsequently, a higher level of BACH1 leads to increasing metastasis, upregulation of glycolysis, and suppression of OXPHOs. Besides, we have validated the strong synergy between PLK1 inhibitor volasertib and vemurafenib in treating melanoma carrying BRAF-V600E. Our in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown an improved efficacy of this combined therapy on inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of cell death, and suppression of cell metastasis compared to mono-treatment. In short, our data has indicated PLK1 as a potent and promising target in cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Polo-like kinase,BRAF,Metastasis,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Fengyi Mao<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Yifan Kong<sup><\/sup>, Chaohao Li<sup><\/sup>, Yanquan Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Xiongjian Rao<sup><\/sup>, Qiongsi Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Xinyi Wang<sup><\/sup>, Zhiguo Li<sup><\/sup>, Xiaoqi Liu<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Toxicology and Cancer Biology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4a36de7d-9905-4fe8-9dce-dd926159d161","ControlNumber":"3536","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

A synthetic lethal interaction of PLK4 with 17q23 amplicon-driven overexpression of TRIM37 was discovered in these tumor types (Meitinger et al. 2020; Yeow et al. 2020). High levels of TRIM37 prevented acentrosomal spindle assembly and rendered cells mitotically vulnerable to inhibition of polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4), a serine\/threonine protein kinase that controls centriole duplication. We have discovered that exquisitely selective small molecule inhibitors of PLK4, which are highly selective against the kinome including against the closely related aurora kinases and PLK1-3, display this synthetic lethal interaction with TRIM37, while less selective inhibitors do not. PLK4 protein levels are regulated through proteasomal degradation induced by PLK4 trans-autophosphorylation of the phosphodegron. PLK4 inhibition results in blocked trans-autophosphorylation leading to stabilization of PLK4, thus directly demonstrating target engagement in cells. Importantly, PLK4 protein stabilization correlated with cell viability for selective PLK4 inhibitors but not for less selective compounds, providing a quantifiable pharmacodynamic (PD) association with antitumor activity. Cell viability assessment in cancer cell lines revealed that highly selective PLK4 inhibitors showed greater potency in TRIM37 high cancer cell lines as compared to TRIM37 low cell lines. In contrast, less selective compounds, including from the clinical literature, did not display differential potency in TRIM37 high versus low cancer cell lines. Additionally, selective PLK4 inhibition induced significantly greater apoptosis in TRIM37 high versus low cancer cell lines as measured with a caspase 3\/7 assay. We confirmed that only selective PLK4 inhibitors are synthetic lethal with TRIM37 amplification using an engineered cell line system of PLK4 G95L, in which the Leucine mutation blocks compound binding but allows the PLK4 enzyme to function. In cell viability assays, selective PLK4 inhibitors were potent in the parental G95 cells and lost activity in L95 cells, unlike less selective inhibitors whose potency did not depend on PLK4. Oral dosing of a selective PLK4 inhibitor resulted in tumor growth inhibition in TRIM37 high xenograft tumors with no body weight loss.<br \/>In summary, we have discovered that highly selective small molecule inhibitors of PLK4 confirm the potential of the synthetic lethal impact in treating tumors with high levels of TRIM37.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-05 Protein kinases and phosphatases as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Polo-like kinase,Breast cancer,Synthetic lethality,Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Siobhan  K.

MCLA-129 is an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) enhanced Biclonics&#174; that targets epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-MET in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other solid tumors. MCLA-129 is a potent inhibitor of tumor growth applying various mechanisms of action (MOA), including inhibition of c-MET and EGFR signaling, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and ADCC. Here we compared the MOA of MCLA-129 with the MOA of the EGFR-c-MET bispecific antibody amivantamab. The binding of MCLA-129 to tumor cells expressing different levels of EGFR and c-MET was quantified using radiolabeled antibodies. Scatchard plot analysis showed that the affinity of MCLA-129 for both c-MET and EGFR is in the low nanomolar range. In FACS, MCLA-129 and amivantamab show similar binding to tumor cells harboring <i>EGFR<\/i> or <i>c-MET<\/i> exon14-skipping mutations. Crossblock experiments with the c-MET binding antibody onartuzumab analog showed that MCLA-129 competes for the same HGF-binding region of c-MET, which is distinct from the binding site of amivantamab according to Neijssen et al, 2021 (PMC8113745). MCLA-129 and amivantamab did not downmodulate EGFR or c-MET. ADCP was also comparable for MCLA-129 and amivantamab, as measured with monocyte-derived macrophages incubated with pHrodo-labeled target cells with readout of tumor cell phagocytosis on the Incucyte&#174; system. In contrast, MCLA-129 displayed ADCC activity similar to or more potently than amivantamab in an ADCC reporter assay with either high affinity Fc&#947;RIII 158V-variant or low affinity 158F-variant effector cells in absence or presence of soluble EGFR and soluble c-MET. MCLA-129-induced ADCC appears to be less affected than amivantimab by the presence of soluble EGFR and soluble c-MET. In conclusion, MCLA-129 is a Biclonics&#174; common light chain bispecific antibody with multiple MOA including inhibition of c-MET and EGFR ligand binding, ADCP and ADCC comparable or more potent than amivantamab. A phase 1\/2 clinical trial of MCLA-129 in solid tumors is ongoing. These data support the further clinical development of MCLA-129 in patients with NSCLC and other solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,EGFR,c-Met,ADCC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>David J.J. de Gorter<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Alexandre Deshiere<sup>1<\/sup>, Arjen Kramer<sup>1<\/sup>, Martijn van Rosmalen<sup>1<\/sup>, Franziska Mortensen<sup>1<\/sup>, Cecile Geuijen<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Merus N.V., Utrecht, Netherlands,<sup>2<\/sup>Merus US Inc., Utrecht, Netherlands","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"275c037c-c7b9-44cc-a750-0c241c416dd6","ControlNumber":"7148","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D. de Gorter, <\/b> None..<br><b>A.

Antibody drug conjugates targeting cMET (cMET-ADCs) have been developed as a strategy to treat cMET+ tumors irrespective of dependency on cMET signaling. cMET- ADCs have shown promising clinical activity, but largely in a subset of NSCLC patients having the highest cMET levels, indicating tumor cMET levels may be limiting for efficacy. We sought to create an ADC with the potential to benefit a broader population of patients including those expressing moderate cMET levels. Here, we describe MYTX-011, an ADC incorporating the clinically validated vcMMAE linker-payload conjugated to a novel, pH-dependent anti-cMET antibody. We hypothesized that engineering the antibody to rapidly lose affinity at acidic endosomal pH would boost ADC uptake and efficacy in cMET+ tumor cells by avoiding non-productive ADC recycling. We conducted mutagenesis of anti-cMET antibodies, screening for variants that selectively lost binding under acidic conditions, and, in parallel, assessed antibody internalization in cell-based assays. The resulting lead humanized IgG1 antibody was conjugated to vcMMAE at engineered cysteine residues (DAR=2) to create MYTX-011, which exhibited rapid dissociation from cMET at pH5.4 but retained high affinity binding at pH7.4 and 6.4. MYTX-011 showed markedly higher (&#62;3 fold) internalization in cMET+ tumor cells and broader, more potent cytotoxicity across a large panel of cMET+ cancer cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i> compared to a matched ADC based on the unmodified parent antibody lacking pH-dependent binding, or an in-house version of a clinical stage cMET ADC. These findings translated <i>in vivo<\/i> where MYTX-011 showed superior efficacy (&#62;3 fold based on dose titration) in NSCLC xenograft models with high (EBC-1) or only moderate cMET expression levels (H1373, H1975) compared to the matched parent ADC or an in-house version of a clinical stage cMET ADC. PK and toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys revealed that MYTX-011 exhibited favorable PK characteristics, and a toxicity profile similar to previously described MMAE-based ADCs. Together, these findings highlight the potential of MYTX-011 as a therapeutic candidate for treating a broader range of cMET+ malignancies than other cMET-ADCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"c-Met,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),NSCLC,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nimish Gera<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kyle Fitzgerald<sup><\/sup>, Vijay Ramesh<sup><\/sup>, Purvi Patel<sup><\/sup>, Lena Kien<sup><\/sup>, Deepak Kanojia<sup><\/sup>, Simon Aoyama<sup><\/sup>, Federico Colombo<sup><\/sup>, Amit Deshpande<sup><\/sup>, William Comb<sup><\/sup>, Thomas Chittenden<sup><\/sup>, Brian Fiske<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Mythic Therapeutics, Waltham, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8dd4c975-7b37-440d-924a-3df63055dc5b","ControlNumber":"2077","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

However, these alterations are often not actionable or are only present in a small subset of patients. Thus, new therapeutic targets are urgently needed. Apart from oncogenic drivers, SCNAs usually also comprise neutral bystander genes without an active role in neoplastic transformation. We hypothesized that passenger events, specifically in amplified regions, could be therapeutically exploited by providing actionable molecules on the cell surface. Using publicly available multi-omics data, we screened cell surface protein-coding genes for their genomic status and expression levels in liver cancer. This screen identified <i>MPZL1 <\/i>(<i>Myelin protein zero-like 1<\/i>), a gene amplified in 75% of hepatocellular carcinomas, accompanied by high mRNA expression in tumors compared to normal livers. <i>MPZL1<\/i> is located on chromosome 1q, one of the most commonly amplified regions across several solid cancer types, and codes for a glycosylated cell surface receptor.<i> <\/i>We further validated MPZL1 protein expression in a wide range of human cancer entities (n=2038 samples) and normal tissues (n=163 samples) by immunohistochemistry and assigned expression scores analogous to the clinically implemented HER2-score. A high percentage of tumors showed scores 2 or 3 (e.g. 48% of HCCs or 89% of TNBCs), whereas healthy tissues were mostly negative or just faintly positive (scores 0 or 1). Moreover, in order to target MPZL1-expressing cells, we generated a highly specific monoclonal antibody directed to the extracellular domain of human MPZL1 protein and thoroughly characterized its binding capacity. Next, the scFv sequence of this antibody was used to generate a CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) construct targeting MPZL1. Luciferase-based cytotoxic assays showed that T cells transduced with this construct can kill various MPZL1-high human cancer cell lines <i>in vitro <\/i>(liver, breast and lung malignant cell lines, among others), whereas they fail to kill respective isogenic cell lines harboring knockout of <i>MPZL1<\/i>. Upon antigen-specific exposure, MPZL1-28&#950; CAR-T cells underwent antigen-dependent proliferation and showed increased cytokine production (IFN&#947;, TNF&#945;, IL-2, GZMB), further confirming their specificity. In summary, our findings reveal MPZL1 as a new target for treatment of 1q-amplified cancers and implement a novel immunotherapeutic strategy based on MPZL1-28&#950; CAR-T cells. Furthermore, our work provides a proof of concept that passenger events within large chromosomal amplifications can serve as potent therapeutic targets and thus opens a new avenue for innovative approaches in anti-cancer drug development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Copy number alterations,Target discovery,Solid tumors,CAR T cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sonia Jiménez Vázquez<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Christos Patsis<sup>2<\/sup>, Luise Butthof<sup>1<\/sup>, Joan Crous Masó<sup>2<\/sup>, Hendrik Wiethoff<sup>3<\/sup>, Matthias Gaida<sup>4<\/sup>, Thomas Longerich<sup>3<\/sup>, Rosella Pellegrino<sup>3<\/sup>, Ilse Hofmann<sup>2<\/sup>, Judith Feucht<sup>5<\/sup>, Darjus Felix Tschaharganeh<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Cell Plasticity and Epigenetic Remodeling, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany,<sup>2<\/sup>German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany,<sup>3<\/sup>University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany,<sup>4<\/sup>University Medical Center Mainz, Mainz, Germany,<sup>5<\/sup>Cellular Therapies, University Hospital Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a67ecaa9-2ce7-477b-b6d7-c83f16b82fa3","ControlNumber":"2873","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

PDACs are one of the most difficult to treat cancers, mainly because of the desmoplastic tumor microenvironment enriched with tumor-supportive extracellular matrix (ECM) and stromal cells. Unfortunately, the efficacies of current pancreatic cancer therapies are limited partly by stroma-mediated drug resistance. We reason that Discoidin Domain Receptors, which belong to the receptor tyrosine kinase family and bind to fibrillar collagens present in the ECM, may be a critical promoter of PDAC growth and progression. Though several drugs targeting DDR proteins have been developed, no inhibitors specific to DDR proteins have been developed.

Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms which drive MBC remain incomplete. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) promote drug resistance and metastasis. It has been reported that fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) plays a key role during the EMT:MET cycle. Furthermore, FGFR1 is amplified in 13% of primary and 20% of metastatic breast cancer patients. Therefore, optimizing inhibition of FGFR1 is crucial for the therapeutic targeting of the late stage breast cancer. First, we examined the efficacies of FGFR kinase inhibitors in the murine based dormant 4T07 tumor model. Inhibition of FGFR kinase activity leads to tumor growth inhibition but fail to eradicate dormant breast cancer cells. Therefore, we explored broader approaches to inhibit FGFR1 expression in addition to blockade of its kinase activity. G-quadruplex (G4) structures are secondary DNA structures commonly found upstream of transcriptional start sites (TSS) of oncogenes restricting their expression. Consequently, pharmacological stabilization of G4 structures within the promoters of cancer-related genes via use of small molecules has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach in cancer. Results herein demonstrate that the proximal promoter of FGFR1 contains sequences that form G4. Circular dichroism was used to verify formation of G4 in the FGFR1 proximal promoter. Importantly, use of the G4-binding compound CX-5461 stabilized the FGFR1 G4 structure, blocked the transcriptional activity of the FGFR1 proximal promoter and decreased FGFR1 expression. Therefore, we implemented the G4 stabilizers in FGFR1 expressing and metastatic drug-resistant cell lines. This approach results in dramatic downregulation of FGFR1 in the protein level after treatment with the G4 stabilizer. G4 stabilizing agents also interfere with constitutive FGFR1 and EMT-driven FGFR1 expression. Importantly, use of the G4-targeting compound CX5461 effectively blocked FGFR1 expression and inhibited FGFR1 downstream signaling, resulting in eradication of dormant breast cancer cells using a 3D culture model system. Finally, <i>in vivo<\/i> application of CX5461 reduced pulmonary tumor growth and prolonged animal survival in an FGFR1-driven model of metastasis. In conclusion, our evaluation of FGFR kinase inhibitors validates clinically observed resistance to this approach in MBC. Moreover, our findings suggest that G4 stabilization may be a potential therapeutic strategy for FGFR1 expressing MBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"G-quadruplex,Breast cancer,Therapeutics,Fibroblast growth factor receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Muhammad Hassan Safdar<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Hang Lin<sup><\/sup>, Sarah Dagher<sup><\/sup>, Jonathan Dickerhoff<sup><\/sup>, Danzhou Yang<sup><\/sup>, Michael  K.

Although the first- to third-generation EGFR small molecule inhibitors have made significant progress in the treatment of EGFR mutant NSCLC patients, acquired mutations have been developed rapidly, resulting in drug resistance. Targeted protein degradation (TPD) technologies including PROteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative modality to address the confronting issues of small molecule inhibitors such as drug resistance. Recently, we have developed a series of heterobifunctional degraders of EGFR mutant proteins, which showed strong degradation ability against a variety of mutant EGFRs including triple mutants with C797S. DC<sub>50<\/sub> (half-maximal degradation concentrations) values of the degraders were obtained using HiBiT assay in NCI-H1975 (EGFR <sup>L858R\/T790M<\/sup>), HCC827 (EGFR <sup>Del19<\/sup>), and H1299 (EGFR <sup>WT<\/sup>) cells. Our lead compounds demonstrated excellent EGFR degradation potency with high selectivity against EGFR wild type. Moreover, C-09045, C-09066, and C-13951 strongly inhibited the cell growth of Ba\/F3 cells harboring one of the EGFR mutations including L858R\/C797S, Del19\/C797S, L858R\/T790M\/C797S, Del19\/T790M\/C797S, and Exon20 NPH insertion. By contrast, these compounds showed much weaker potency in normal lung fibroblast (HFL-1) and Ba\/F3 cells harboring EGFR wild-type. In PK analysis, C-09066 showed good oral bioavailability in mice (F%=41.4) with desirable pharmacokinetic parameters and robust tumor growth inhibition efficacy in the NCI-H1975 EGFR <sup>L858R\/T790M\/C797S<\/sup> xenograft and the Ba\/F3 <sup>Del19\/C797S<\/sup> allograft mouse models. In summary, we have identified selective, potent, and orally bioavailable degraders of various EGFR mutant proteins with broad spectrum anti-tumor efficacy both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),NSCLC,PROTAC,Protein Degrader,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dong Hyuk Ki<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Min Sung Joo<sup>1<\/sup>, Joonwoo Nam<sup>1<\/sup>, Hunmi Choi<sup>1<\/sup>, Kyoungwan Seo<sup>1<\/sup>, Eun-Jung Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Jiyeon Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Chulwon Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Jimmy Taiguang Jin<sup>3<\/sup>, Wooseok Han<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Cyrus Therapeutics, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Bridge Biotherapeutics, Seongnam, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Bridge Biotherapeutics, Cambridge, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3b98cd40-cebe-421b-9a01-4f270aa18688","ControlNumber":"640","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.
