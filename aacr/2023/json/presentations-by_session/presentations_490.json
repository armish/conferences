[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Tumor recurrence is the most common cause of treatment failure after surgical resection. Quaking (QKI) is a functional protein that mediate alternative splicing, which belongs to the STAR family of the KH domain, containing RNA binding proteins. QKI regulate various genes via alternative splicing and circRNA formation during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). QKI takes an important part in tumorigenesis. QKI has been reported to be associated with progression of human cancer. However, several studies have indicated that QKI was associated with repression of EMT. Furthermore, the prognostic value of QKI in lung cancer patients and its regulatory mechanisms in EMT in lung cancer cells remains unknown.<br \/><b>Materials and Methods:<\/b> A total of 79 patients with resected lung adenocarcinoma were included in the study. QKI expression was determined by immunohistochemistry in tumor specimens. The prognostic value of QKI overexpression and its relationship with clinicopathological variables were investigated. QKI knockdown was performed in H1299 and A549 cells. Western blotting analysis was performed to demonstrated QKI, E-cadherin and vimentin expression.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> QKI overexpression was significantly associated with female gender (<i>P<\/i> = 0.045). There was no significant association between QKI overexpression and predominant pattern group (lepidic\/acinar\/ papillary vs. micropapillary\/solid) (<i>P<\/i> = 0.180). Univariate analysis indicated that predominant pattern group (lepidic\/acinar\/papillary vs. micropapillary\/solid) (<i>P <\/i>= 0.006) was a significant prognostic factor for worse recurrence-free survival (RFS). QKI overexpression (<i>P <\/i>= 0.042) was a significant prognostic factor for better RFS. Increased vimentin expression and decreased E-cadherin expression were identified in H1299 and A549 cells after QKI knockdown.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> QKI overexpression has the potential to be a significant prognostic factor for better RFS in patients with resected lung adenocarcinoma. Increased vimentin expression and decreased E-cadherin expression were identified in H1299-QKIi cells. QKI may possess the ability to inhibit invasion and migration through repressing EMT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Prognosis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Ying-Shiun Kao<sup><\/sup>, <b>Jung-Jyh Hung<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2483d6e4-6055-419a-9d5b-0243d8b46a02","ControlNumber":"6631","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

The hallmarks of the EMT phenomenon are mainly the loss of cell-cell adhesion, acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype, gain of mobility and invasiveness, and attainment of enhanced tumorigenicity and anchorage-independent growth. After EMT, cancer cells can enter and survive in fluid-filled spaces and subsequently colonize distant sites. Despite a huge body of <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> evidence recognizing EMT as an important event in tumor progression, whether EMT exists in naturally-occurring experimental settings remains a contentious debate in the field of pathology. Lack of convincing histopathological evidence of EMT in tumor subtypes without spindle sarcomatous tumor components and lack of dynamic change demonstration of EMT are to blame. In this report, we devised a naturally-occurring experimental setting to prove the existence of EMT in tumors completely lacking histological evidence of EMT. Further, we demonstrated dynamic change of EMT in <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> settings. We performed primary culture 37H from a monophasic metaplastic squamous cell carcinoma tissue (MMSCC), which exhibited no histologic features reminiscent of EMT, to examine whether EMT exists in tumors without sarcomatous histology. Two dominant subtypes demonstrating different morphology were derived from parental 37H: polygonal epithelial-type (HE) and epithelioid mesenchymal-type (HM) cells. The HE cells were E-cadherin<sup>+<\/sup>vimentin<sup>-<\/sup><sup> <\/sup>predominant; while the HM cells were E-cadherin<sup>-<\/sup>vimentin<sup>+<\/sup> predominant, and functionally concomitant with increased migration and invasion and anchorage-independent tumorigenicity. Taking advantage of the inherited differences between the HE and HM cells, we performed head-to-head comparison by RNA-seq and subsequently identified key EMT transcription factors (EMT-TFs)<i> ZEB1<\/i> and <i>ZEB2<\/i> in this naturally-occurring experimental setting. In the primary MMSCC tissue where 37H was derived, the upregulation of <i>ZEB1<\/i> and <i>ZEB2<\/i> was also observed in vimentin<sup>+<\/sup> carcinoma cells. Further, the dynamic change of EMT was demonstrated in the HE and HM cells in <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> settings. Spontaneous EMT was observed specifically in the ZEB1-or ZEB2-overexpressed polygonal epithelial-type cells; the knockdown of <i>ZEB1<\/i> and <i>ZEB2 <\/i>reverted EMT in the HM cells; and reverse EMT was found a requirement for HM cells to grow in a xenograft mouse model. In conclusion, this report backed up the existence of EMT in naturally-occurring tumor without histologic evidence of EMT. The identification of underlying regulators contributing to spontaneous EMT, and the demonstration of EMT dynamic change were also included.<sup><\/sup>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Breast cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Huang-Chun Lien<sup>1<\/sup>, Hui-Chieh Yu<sup>2<\/sup>, Tom Wei-Wu Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, I-Chun Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Chiao Lo<sup>1<\/sup>, Ling-Chun Yeh<sup>1<\/sup>, Li-Ping Hsiao<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Yen-Shen Lu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan,<sup>2<\/sup>Institute of Biologics, Development Center for Biotechnology, Taipei, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"332f9a32-d578-463f-be43-34f9881fb202","ControlNumber":"2566","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

SETD2, the sole histone methyltransferase that catalyzes trimethylation of lysine 36 on histone H3 (H3K36me3), is frequently mutated in ccRCC. Studies have shown that SETD2 mutations are often subclonal and the mutation rate dramatically increases from 25% in primary ccRCC to more than 60% in metastatic ccRCC, suggesting SETD2 loss plays an important role in renal cancer metastasis. However, mechanisms underpinning how SETD2 mutation drives invasion and metastasis in ccRCC is largely unknown. Here, by performing RNA-seq and ATAC-seq in a non-tumorigenic renal epithelial cell line isogenic for SETD2 loss-of-function, we found that SETD2 inactivation induces dramatic changes in the transcriptome and drastically enhances chromatin accessibility, which allows binding of a variety of transcription factors. We also discovered that SETD2 loss induces a TGF&#946;-independent EMT program, which is a major pathway linked to metastasis. Correlation of RNA-seq with ATAC-seq identifies SOX2, OCT2 and PRRX1 as key transcription factors promoting the SETD2 loss-driven EMT program. Furthermore, we found that this distinct EMT program is in part triggered by secreted factors, which suggests that SETD2 mutation promotes a metastasis-permissive tumor microenvironment through paracrine signaling. In summary, our findings reveal that SETD2 is a key regulator of EMT phenotypes that may explain the role of SETD2 mutations in ccRCC metastasis and further uncover potential therapeutic targets for SETD2-mutant ccRCC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),SETD2 mutation,H3K36me3,TGF-&#946;,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tianchu Wang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ryan Wagner<sup>2<\/sup>, Ryan Hlady<sup>2<\/sup>, Sungho Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiaoyu Pan<sup>2<\/sup>, Thai Ho<sup>3<\/sup>, Keith Robertson<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN,<sup>2<\/sup>Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN,<sup>3<\/sup>Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Phoenix, AZ","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4ddf2ded-9513-4ddd-8c56-3af95a8e5e36","ControlNumber":"4697","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

Plasticity between epithelial and mesenchymal status is referred as epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP). The significance of spontaneous change of EMP is under investigation in the field of EMT. To date, spontaneous EMP is reported in breast and prostate cancer, which leads to the acquisition of stem-cell properties and chemoresistance. On the other hand, the presence of spontaneous EMP is still not examined in other cancer including esophageal cancer. In the present study, we tackled the question of whether esophageal cancer have the potency of spontaneous EMP. We screened eleven esophageal squamous cancer cell (ESCC) cell lines with CD44 isoform expression, which is known to reflect epithelial and mesenchymal status. Interestingly, KYSE520 was found to comprise heterogenous populations consisting of CD44v+ and CD44v- subpopulations. CD44v+ and CD44v- cells showed the expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers, respectively. Single-cell sorting of CD44v+ and CD44v- cells revealed both cells gave rise to cell populations consisting of CD44v+ and CD44v- cells, indicating CD44v+ epithelial-like and CD44v- mesenchymal-like cells can generate counterparts, respectively. This EMP was maintained in next generation. Further, we found the generation of counterparts between CD44v+ and CD44v- cells in vivo. Epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1 (ESRP1) is reported as the regulator of CD44 mRNA splicing. The role of ESRP1 in EMP is not well understood in esophageal cancer. The inhibition of ESRP1 shifted CD44v+ to CD44v- cells in KYSE520. However, the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers or transcriptional factors were almost not affected, suggesting ESRP1 functions downstream of EMP. Our results firstly revealed the presence of spontaneous EMP in esophageal cancer and give a new insight in the field of EMT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),CD44,Esophageal cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kenji Tsuchihashi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yuki Hirata<sup>2<\/sup>, Juntaro Yamasaki<sup>3<\/sup>, Kentaro Suina<sup>2<\/sup>, Kenro Tanoue<sup>1<\/sup>, Toshifumi Yae<sup>4<\/sup>, Kenta Masuda<sup>5<\/sup>, Eishi Baba<sup>6<\/sup>, Koichi Akashi<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuko Kitagawa<sup>7<\/sup>, Hideyuki Saya<sup>8<\/sup>, Osamu Nagano<sup>9<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Fukuoka, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, School of Medicine, Keio University, School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Respiratory Medicine, Juntendo University, Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Keio University, School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>6<\/sup>Department of Oncology and Social Medicine, Kyushu University, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Fukuoka, Japan,<sup>7<\/sup>Department of Surgery, Keio University, School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>8<\/sup>Cancer Center, Fujita Health University, Aichi, Japan,<sup>9<\/sup>Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, Keio University, School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"73724657-f982-4889-a206-4747867ae688","ControlNumber":"2564","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

Remarkably, RNA sequencing unraveled striking upregulation of FOXC2 in E\/M relative to M cells, which was suppressed by TCF1 inhibition. Moreover, FOXC2 knockdown in E\/M cells destabilized the E\/M state, whereas FOXC2 overexpression induced M to E\/M transition.

Despite significant research efforts, metastatic cancers and relapse remain the primary cause of cancer related deaths. In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), metastasis is present in one-third of patients at the time of diagnosis, and one-third of patients who initially present with locally advanced disease eventually develop local or distant recurrence following resection of the primary tumor, highlighting the need for new RCC therapies and further insight into the metastatic process. Using patient biopsies, immunohistochemistry, sequencing, and available clinical data in a cohort of RCC patients, we found that patients with more epithelial tumors have a significantly lower risk of recurrence. Unexpectedly, patients whose tumors had a mesenchymal protein signature had significantly increased infiltration of macrophages within their tumors. Additionally, increased macrophages in the primary tumor were significantly associated with a higher tumor stage at diagnosis and worse overall survival, suggesting that macrophages may play an important role in EMT in ccRCC. Furthermore, whole exome sequencing revealed that patients with increased macrophage infiltrate had a mutational loss of SETD2, a histone methyltransferase. Additionally, macrophages and EMT are also correlated, and tumor cell adhesion is reduced when SETD2 is lost in ccRCC patients. Further studies are needed to determine if SETD2 loss plays a role in the recruitment of macrophages to the tumor and EMT. Further characterization of the gene signatures, metabolic phenotypes, and immune cell infiltrate within these patient samples will lead to a better understanding of metastasis in an oncogene- and tissue-specific manner and thus lead to more efficacious therapies for metastatic patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastatic tumors,Renal cell carcinoma,Macrophages,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Emily Nicole Arner<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Melissa  M.

This study aims to characterize exosomes from the serum of patients with Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare, low-grade, metastasizing neoplasm that occurs predominantly in females. Using Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), serum from LAM patients (n=19) have significantly increased numbers of exosomes compared to serum samples from healthy controls (n=20) (8.9x10<sup>9<\/sup> vs 13.8x10<sup>9<\/sup> particles\/ml; p=0.024). Furthermore, particles counts are significantly negatively correlated with the forced expiratory volume (FEV1) (r=-0.4667; p-value=0.0295) in LAM patients. Metalloproteinase activity in exosomes was measured by zymography. Interestingly, these LAM-derived exosomes had significantly higher activity of Pro-MMP-9 (3-fold increase; p-value=0.0278). We analyzed the effects of serum-derived exosomes on cells from an A549 cell line. Increased expression of vimentin, a major marker of EMT, was observed in cells treated with LAM-derived exosomes compared to healthy controls (1.4-fold increase; p=0.0217). Moreover, we showed by a modified Boyden chamber assay that exosomes derived from serum treatment increases the invasive capacity of A549 cells (fold change of 2.2; p-value=0.0004). We interrogated the LAM Single Cell Atlas and identified increased expression of TWIST1, a key transcription factor for EMT. TWIST1 was increased 8-fold in the lung and was uniquely expressed in 'LAM cells', which had metastasized. Furthermore, proteomic analysis revealed high expression of C3 and C5 in LAM-derived exosomes (respectively 1.4- and 2.1-fold change; p=0.0276 and p=0.0034) suggesting the potential regulatory role of the compliment system in the EMT mediated by exosomes These preliminary results highlight the urge to study the specific mechanistic interplay between MMPs and EMT, mediated by exosomes, and whether exosomes are involved in the metastatic spread of LAM cells to the lung and their role in influencing innate and adaptive immune cell response to this invasion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Exosomes,Premetastatic niche,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Amina Jouida<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Patrick McFadden<sup><\/sup>, Grace Buckley<sup><\/sup>, Evelyn Lynn<sup><\/sup>, O'Callaghan Marissa<sup><\/sup>, Yasuhito Sekimoto<sup><\/sup>, Aurelie Fabre<sup><\/sup>, Michael  P.

During this process, epithelial cells acquire migratory and stem-like characteristics, which allow them to travel through vasculature and form distant metastases in a secondary organ site via the reverse process of MET. Initially thought of as a binary process, it is now well established that cells can be stably arrested en route to EMT in an intermediate hybrid state (H) with characteristics falling on a spectrum between the epithelial (E) and mesenchymal (M) phenotypes. This non-transient intermediate state is stabilized by phenotypic stability factors and is associated with more tumor aggressiveness, worse treatment response, and patient outcomes. Although abundant time-course single-cell RNA sequencing data exists, enabling dynamical single-cell analysis of EMT, current methods of EMT state inference are optimized on microarray data. Thus, there is a large need for a computational framework that infers and predicts the E, H, and M fractions at transient and steady states from single-cell RNA sequencing data. Here, we introduce a fully stochastic continuous-time Markov model to predict the dynamics of EMT transitions from time-course data. We fit our continuous-time model on a multi-replicate time-course flow cytometry data of MCF10A cell line where TGF is withdrawn at different days following treatment for each replicate. We then demonstrate that our model is extendable to time-course single-cell RNA sequencing data utilizing a novel data-driven pipeline. Our data-driven pipeline infers the three E, H, and M trajectories from time-dependent and dose-dependent single-cell RNA sequencing data. We confirm our trajectories accurately reflect the E, H, and M states via gene-set enrichment analysis. We find the fraction of cells in each state at stationary distribution using our data-driven pipeline and show that they match the predictions of a previous simulation study. By applying the stochastic model to time-course single-cell RNA sequencing trajectories of four cancer cell lines (A549, MCF7, OVCA420, and DU145), we show that the stochastic model accurately predicts context-specific EMT dynamics over time. Our model is the first RNA sequencing-based method for tracking EMT from longitudinal data at the single-cell resolution and therefore is of immediate utility for studying metastatic signatures in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Metastasis,Single cell,Sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Annice Najafi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mohit  K.

Chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), where acidic bile salts (ABS) abnormally refluxate into the esophagus, is the leading risk factor for the development of a metaplastic condition known as Barrett&#8217;s esophagus (BE) and its progression to EAC. We used 3D organotypic culture, mouse and human tissue samples to assess the role of ABS in Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in EAC. Analysis of public databases revealed significant enrichment of EMT signaling in EAC progression. RNA-seq analysis of EAC cells showed activation of EMT pathway in response to ABS exposure. ABS induced multiple characteristics of the EMT process, such as downregulation of E-cadherin, upregulation of Vimentin, activation of &#223;-catenin and EMT-transcription factors (EMT-TFs), cell morphological changes, and enhancement of cell migration and invasion capabilities. Mechanistically, we discovered that ABS induced E-cadherin cleavage via MMP14 proteolytic cascade. APE1 silencing, or APE1-redox-specific inhibitor (E3330), abrogated the ABS-induced EMT process and signaling by downregulating MMP14. Furthermore, APE1 and MMP14 co-expression levels were inversely correlated with E-cadherin expression in gastroesophageal junctions of human EAC tissues, and the L2-IL1&#223; transgenic mouse model of BE\/EAC. EAC patients with high APE1 and EMT signatures had worse relapse free survival than those with low signature. In a summary,<b> <\/b>this study demonstrates the role of ABS in promoting EMT via the redox-sensitive signaling axis of APE1\/MMP14\/E-cadherin\/&#223;-catenin. Pharmacological inhibition of APE1-redox function could be a potential therapeutic approach to effectively reduce the risk of Barrett&#8217;s carcinogenesis.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"E-cadherin,APE1,MMP14,EMT,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Heng Lu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Longlong Cao<sup>2<\/sup>, Farah Ballout<sup>1<\/sup>, Abbes Belkhiri<sup>3<\/sup>, Dunfa Peng<sup>4<\/sup>, Lei Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Mohammed Soutto<sup>1<\/sup>, Oliver McDonald<sup>1<\/sup>, Alexander Zaika<sup>1<\/sup>, Jianwen Que<sup>5<\/sup>, Wael El-Rifai<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Miami, Miami, FL,<sup>2<\/sup>Fujian Medical University, Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Cell biology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN,<sup>4<\/sup>Surgery, University of Miami, Miami, FL,<sup>5<\/sup>Columbia University, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"64a7cbaf-906e-4cfe-9d09-b75c965155f8","ControlNumber":"1944","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

In this study, we showed that PD-L1 facilitates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells by upregulating EMT transcription factors and mesenchymal markers, and downregulating epithelial marker. RNA-sequencing was performed on paired exogenously PD-L1-overexpressed A549 cells and wild-type cells, and PD-L1-depleted H460 cells and wild-type cells, and transcriptomic features associated with PD-L1 status were identified using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).

Recombinant PD-1 treatment also increased the expression of EMT transcription factors and markers on A549 and H460 cells. Moreover, interferon-&#947; stimulation on tumor cells increased expression of EMT transcription factors and markers, which was suppressed by PD-L1-knockdown, suggesting that interferon-&#947;-induced PD-L1 contributes to EMT.

Through EMT, neoplastic cells obtain metastatic capabilities like enhanced motility, invasion, and resistance to apoptosis. Recent studies have highlighted dynamic cell plasticity during EMT, including a highly tumorigenic population of cells within the full spectrum of transitions that adopt a partial EMT state. These hybrid populations retain a higher degree of metastatic ability due to the dual nature of their phenotype; however, concomitant expression of epithelial and mesenchymal traits makes characterization and analysis difficult. Additionally, the total expression of certain markers can remain unchanged during EMT while their subcellular localization and function is altered. Therefore, there is a need to improve analytical methods to better characterize hybrid EMT populations and elucidate the genetic modulators that govern advancement along the EMT spectrum. In this study, we provide an optimized method of automated whole-well imaging and analysis for characterization of the EMT spectrum and hybrid phenotypes. We utilized three different TGF-&#946;-induced EMT models. Cell lines cultured in 96-well plates were treated with TGF-&#946; and\/or a specific inhibitor of the TGF-&#946; receptor, SB431542, at different times between 30 minutes and 48 hours before fixing and labeling by immunofluorescence. Expression and subcellular localization of TGF-&#946; effectors Smad2\/3; epithelial markers E-cadherin, ZO-1, and &#946;-catenin; and mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, fibronectin, and vimentin, were analyzed and quantified using an automated cell imager system and associated analysis software. In addition, nuclei and cell perimeters were identified to analyze protein nuclear translocation and cell size and shape, respectively. Through these studies, we have successfully isolated a hybrid cell subpopulation emerging at 18 hours of TGF-&#946; treatment. These cells display a partial loss of E-cadherin and upregulation of fibronectin that constitutes a unique proteome distinct from that of fully epithelial and mesenchymal populations. Using RNA-interference, we are currently testing 15 candidate genes we previously identified from a microRNA screen on EMT progression and the hybrid state. In summary, we developed and optimized a novel imaging and analysis method for rapid assessment of EMT cell populations, and identification of novel modulators of the EMT spectrum. This method can be more widely applied to screen for small molecules or therapeutic peptides affecting EMT-driven malignancy. Given that the hybrid phenotype is now considered to have higher metastatic characteristics overall, we believe this approach will facilitate identification and testing of potential targets for treatment of metastatic disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Metastasis,Image analysis,TGF-&#946;,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Daniel  J.

It is now recognized that EMT is not a binary program, and cancer cells rarely switch to a fully mesenchymal phenotype. Rather, cancer cells exist in multiple hybrid epithelial\/mesenchymal (E\/M) states responsible for cell population heterogeneity, which is advantageous for the ever-changing environment during tumor development and metastasis. How are these hybrid states generated and maintained is not fully understood. We show that direct interaction between small cell lung carcinoma cells (SCLC) and lung fibroblasts induces a hybrid EMT phenotype in cancer cells in which several mesenchymal genes involved in receptor interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and ECM remodeling are upregulated while epithelial genes such as E-cadherin remain unchanged. We also demonstrate that several core EMT-regulating transcription factors (EMT-TFs) are upregulated in cancer cells during direct contact with fibroblasts, as is Yes-associated protein (YAP1), a major regulator of the Hippo pathway. Further, we show that these changes are transient and reverse to the initial state once the interaction is disrupted. Altogether, our results provide evidence that tumor cells&#8217; direct contact with the fibroblasts in the TME initiates a signaling cascade responsible for hybrid E\/M states of cancer cells. These hybrid states are maintained during the interaction and possibly contribute to therapy resistance and immune evasion, while interference with direct contact will result in slow recovery and a switch to the initial states.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Cancer-associated fibroblasts,Transcription factor,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nilu Dhungel<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Ana-Maria Dragoi<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, LSU Health Sciences Center - Shreveport, Shreveport, LA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"39df25e3-943c-45a9-a5cd-e32e761db770","ControlNumber":"4988","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

Autophagy is a highly conserved process of cellular self-digestion that involves the formation of autophagosomes for the delivery of intracellular components and dysfunctional organelles to lysosomes. This process is induced by different signals including starvation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and DNA damage. The molecular link between autophagy and DNA damage is not well understood yet. Importantly, tumor cells utilize the mechanism of autophagy to cope with genotoxic anti-cancer drug therapy. Another mechanism of drug resistance is provided to cancer cells via the execution of the EMT program. One of the critical transcription factors of EMT is Zeb1. Here we demonstrate that Zeb1 is involved in the regulation of autophagy in several breast cancer cell models. On the molecular level, forced expression of Zeb1 in otherwise epithelial cells likely facilitates autophagy through the regulation of several autophagic genes, resulting in increased LC3-II levels, augmented staining with Lysotracker, and increased resistance to genotoxic drugs. On the contrary, the attenuation of Zeb1 expression in TNBC cells led to the opposite effect. Consequently, we propose that Zeb1 augments the resistance of breast cancer cells to genotoxic drugs, at least partially, by promoting autophagy. Collectively, we have uncovered a novel function of Zeb1 in the regulation of autophagy in breast cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Transcription factor,Autophagy,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nick  A.

The 60 KD Heat shock protein (HSP60) is a Mitochondrial protein that plays a role in stabilizing and refolding proteins and is regulated by HSPD1 gene. In normal cells, HSPD1 gene expression is controlled, however in TNBC, HSPD1 overexpression is common and is associated with poor cancer-specific survival. This study aims to understand downstream signaling pathways dependent on the function of HSPD1 in TNBC. Method To understand downstream signaling pathways dependent on the function of HSPD1, we analyzed the transcriptomic profiles of metastatic MDA-MB-231-WT and HSPD1-KD cells. Results Bioinformatics data analysis shows that HSPD1 is overexpressed in TNBC, particularly in basal subtype. High expression of HSPD1 related to low survival in breast cancer patients. HSPD1 KD in MDA-MB-231 cells identified several differentially regulated genes (DEG) as compared to WT MDA-MB-231 cells by RNA-seq analysis. Pathway analysis of DEG showed downregulation of mitochondrial respiration, thermogenesis, citric acid cycle, PD-1 signaling while upregulation of estrogen dependent gene expression, estrogen mediated signaling, nuclear receptor transcription pathway. These suggests that HSP60 overexpression in TNBC promotes basal type phenotype. Downregulation of HSP60 expression upregulated hormone receptors, particularly estrogen receptor (ESR1) and androgen receptor (AR) expression, thus inducing basal to luminal switch in MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings suggest that loss of HSPD1 significantly Induces plasticity in TNBC. Conclusion Our results suggest that loss of HSPDI in the context TNBC cells may promotes oncogenic transformation to an intermediary luminal progenitor phenotype that gains differentiation plasticity based on the upregulation of Estrogen-receptors signaling pathways. Ongoing analyses will be performed to identify the possible links between loss of HSPD1 and key transcription factors that define mammary epithelial cell differentiation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-03 Epithelial\/mesenchymal transition (EMT and MET),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET),HSPD1,plasticity,TNBC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Muhammad  G.

Prostate Cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer death among men, ranked next to lung cancer in the United States of America. Aggressive growth, metastatic abilities, resistance, and reoccurrence are the main reasons for the most number of deaths among PCa patients. The proto-oncogene MDM2 controls multiple signaling pathways that are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, proliferation, and survival of cancer cells. MDM2 also has a major role in imparting stemness and EMT abilities to PCa cells that are inherently less aggressive. During cancer growth, lipid metabolism is also known to play a pivotal role in cellular reprogramming, which eventually leads to the induction of EMT and the acquisition of stemness. It has been well documented that the intermediates of mevalonate metabolism can significantly affect gene expressions and influence the tumor microenvironment to support cancer growth and survival. Also, there is a lack of comprehensive knowledge about the use of RG7388 in cancers with p53 mutation since it is believed to be most effective in cancers with functional p53. Therefore, our study was designed to investigate the individual and combined effects of RG7388 and simvastatin in p53 mutant PCa cells. Western blot analysis technique was used to analyze the expression levels of mesenchymal and stem cell markers in PC3 and DU145 PCa cells, before and after they were treated with RG7388, simvastatin, or their combination. The MTT assay method was used to assess the cell viability of the PCa cells after 24 or 48 hours of treatment with different concentrations of RG7388 or simvastatin. Spheroid formation assay with stem cell marker analysis was performed following drug treatments. A scratch assay was also conducted to determine the inhibition of cancer cell migration by the above-mentioned drugs. Our experimental results showed a decrease in the viability of PC3 and DU145 cells, in a time and dose-dependent manner, after treatment with RG7388 or simvastatin. The mesenchymal and stem cell markers were also downregulated along with the disintegration of spheroids causing a reduction in the total number of spheroids and colonies after RG7388, simvastatin, and combination treatments. Immunofluorescence staining of spheroids revealed a significant downregulation of cancer stem cell markers among all treated groups. Furthermore, the scratch assay showed inhibition of migration of the PCa cells, particularly after the combination treatments. Our results have confirmed that RG7388, simvastatin, and their combination treatments can reverse EMT, inhibit migration, and reduce cancer stemness in p53 mutant prostate cancer cells.

Extensive studies have focused on mTORC1 in the regulation of cell growth, autophagy, and metabolism. However, the role of mTORC2 is poorly understood. mTORC2 has been found to control cell migration, but the underlying mechanism remains to be determined. Here we show that mammalian stress-activated protein kinase interacting protein 1 (mSin1), a unique component of mTORC2, plays an important role in cell migration. Knockout of mSin1 reduced the migration of mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Similarly, knockdown of mSin1 also inhibited the migration of tumor cells (Rh30 and HeLa). Furthermore, we observed that mSin1 is crucial for the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Knockout or knockdown of mSin1 promoted the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), a transition from multipolar or spindle shape to apico-basal polar shape. In addition, depletion of mSin1 increased the cellular protein level of E-cadherin (an MET marker) and decreased the cellular protein levels of N-cadherin and Twist (EMT markers). The results suggest that mSin1 positively regulates cell migration at least partly by promoting induction of EMT. Our findings support that mSin1 is crucial for mTORC2-mediated cell migration.

The development of ascites in PDAC patients generally indicates a poor prognosis although the reasons for this largely remain unknown. The exact mechanism of peritoneal spread of the cancer is still largely unknown. Herein, we collected and processed sterile ascites samples of 20 PDAC samples from 19 patients and performed single-cell RNA-seq analysis. Sixteen ascites samples were obtained from abdominal paracentesis and two cases in the postmortem period. For one patient ascites was collected both pre and postmortem. All but one patient received chemotherapy prior to ascites collection. Routine clinical cytology evaluation of ascites samples from 17 patients indicated it was malignant in 11 patients and nonmalignant in six patients. All ascites samples were purified by gradient centrifuge using Ficoll-Paque Plus to remove erythrocytes and necrotic debris. DAPI negative and Calcein positive cells were selected to enrich live cells from the cell suspension by flow sorting. We adopted the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell Gene Expression platform for single-cell RNA-seq library preparation. Scanpy was used for computational analysis of expression data after Cell Ranger pipelines. After QC check, normalization and doublet elimination, a total of 248,263 cells were analyzed. UMAP projection accurately clustered cells from each patient. Cell type annotation identified large numbers of immune cells compared to cancer cells and mesothelial cells with the most dominant population being macrophages. A subpopulation (0.23% of all cells) representing plasmacytoid dendritic cells was also found. Cancer cells were detected in twelve samples whereas no cancer cells were detected in eight samples after exhaustive marker gene exploration, and these findings largely matched the clinical diagnoses for each sample. In the ongoing period we will compare malignant versus non-malignant ascites by differential gene expression analysis, gene set enrichment analysis and trajectory inference to determine a) the extent the immunological clusters are enriched in malignant versus benign ascites, b) the distinct phenotypes and cell states of PDAC cells in immune rich versus immune poor ascites, c) role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells or mesothelial cells contribution to formation of malignant ascites. We believe our results will shed light on the dynamics of ascites formation and in turn identify novel targets for intervention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ascites fluid,Pancreatic cancer,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Mesothelium,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shigeaki Umeda<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Elias- Ramzey Karnoub<sup><\/sup>, Etay Ziv<sup><\/sup>, Jean Wu<sup><\/sup>, Cristian Cruz<sup><\/sup>, Wungki Park<sup><\/sup>, Fiyinfolu Balogun<sup><\/sup>, Alejandro Jiménez- Sánchez<sup><\/sup>, Ronan Chaligné<sup><\/sup>, Eileen M.

This study took advantage of single-cell multiomics sequencing to profile the molecular and cellular dynamics in tumor cells and associated microenvironment during brain metastasis. Among different primary cancer types, our data suggest that there are conserved yet distinct tumor cell subpopulations, governed by specific changes in gene expression, chromatin accessibility and tumor-stroma interactions. We characterized the conserved tumor subpopulations of brain metastasis with features of: (1) dormancy, (2) enhanced translation and migration, (3) cell death and (4) high proliferation rate. Dormant tumor cells in brain metastasis appear to limit cell-cell interactions with the surrounding microenvironment. In line with previous observations, dormant cells exhibit distinct stimulation for interferon, oxidative phosphorylation and HIPPO signaling. Despite a pronounced cell plasticity, trajectory analysis uncovered a cell progression pattern and its major sequential states and driving genes. Importantly, the tumor trajectory provides new insights into the regulatory landscape controlling the transition from dormant to proliferating tumor cells. Our findings also point to a valuable use of matched isolated circulating tumor cells and cell-free DNA to map the molecular and cellular dynamics of brain metastases. This work demonstrated that despite a pronounced intratumoral heterogeneity, brain metastases present conserved tumor subpopulations regardless of the patient and primary type. A novel and key finding in this study is the multiomics characterization of the regulatory landscape shaping human brain metatastases. Thus, we believe further understanding of these key regulatory elements could lead to novel tumor targets with broad translational potential.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain metastasis,Multiomics,Microenvironment,Dormancy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Remi Klotz<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Alexis Zukowski<sup>2<\/sup>, Mohamed Kamal<sup>1<\/sup>, Frank Attenelo<sup>3<\/sup>, Srinivas Ramachandran<sup>2<\/sup>, Min Yu<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO,<sup>3<\/sup>Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"81c6e642-1619-48e0-8ff8-3292dede1577","ControlNumber":"2121","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.

Death from PCa is typically due to the lack of effective treatments for advanced forms of prostate cancers including castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and metastatic prostate cancers (mPCa). Distantly metastasized cancers drop the 5-year survival rate from 98% to 30%. Understanding the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that lead to the development of these advanced prostate cancers could improve treatment options. The RON receptor tyrosine kinase is a cell surface receptor, which is activated by growth factor ligands (HGFL or Gas6), which binding promotes several cancer phenotypes in various cancers including prostate cancer. Our laboratory has shown that RON is overexpressed in 86% of primary and 100% of metastatic human prostate cancers compared to normal prostate tissue. Additionally, we have shown that RON overexpression in the prostates of mice can induce Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions, adenocarcinoma, and increases several cancer phenotypes including proliferation, cell survival, metastasis, and increased recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages. However, we have yet to explore the effect of RON on prostate cancer metastasis. We hypothesize that RON expression enhances metastasis by promoting an increase in the amount of disseminating prostate cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, the Hi-Myc mouse model has been employed. The MYC gene is one of the most dysregulated genes in prostate cancers and Myc expression has been detected in the early stages of prostate cancer development, PIN lesion, and all later stages of prostate cancer. Additionally, the Hi-Myc model is clinically relevant as prostate tumor development in this model is similar to that in humans in regard to progression from PIN lesions to adenocarcinoma. From the Hi-Myc model, we have generated two additional genetic modifications within prostate epithelial cells: 1) Hi-Myc mice with prostate-specific RON overexpression (OE) and 2) Hi-Myc mice with prostate-specific RON loss (&#916;Epi). In this study we report that a lack of prostate RON expression diminishes adenocarcinoma development and metastasis within the Hi-Myc mouse model. Moreover, RON overexpression promotes the development of metastatic adenocarcinoma that was not observed in the prostates from Hi-Myc control mice. These studies suggest that RON expression supports the advancement of primary tumors to metastatic prostate cancer within the Hi-Myc mouse models. Therefore, future directions include determining the signaling pathways driven by RON that promotes this metastatic phenotype in both castration-sensitive and resistant tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK),,Prostate,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Angelle D.

Our laboratory has demonstrated that the IL-6-family cytokine oncostatin M (OSM) increases circulating tumor cell (CTC) numbers and metastases to lung in vivo, and that OSM stays active when bound to proteins in the extracellular matrix, thus &#8220;bioaccumulating&#8221; in the tumor microenvironment. These published findings are supported by our results demonstrating that OSM strongly promotes expression and secretion of IL-6 from breast cancer cells. Interestingly, the increased production of IL-6 by OSM occurs only in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) cells. It is well known that patients with ER- breast cancer, specifically triple negative breast cancer (TNBC; ER- PR- HER2-), have limited therapeutic options. However, the divergent role OSM plays in ER+ and ER- breast cancer and the mechanism by which this occurs has yet to be fully understood. Thus, we aimed to fully elucidate the difference between OSM in ER+ versus ER- breast cancer. First, we performed RNA-Seq analysis on OSM-treated human ER+ T47D cells and ER- TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells and discovered significant differences in gene expression between both cell lines upon treatment with OSM, including alteration in DNA-replication and cell cycle pathway genes. Next, to better understand the mechanism by which OSM-mediated IL-6 secretion is repressed, we utilized a computational modeling approach and evaluated the direct inhibition of STAT3 and ER to identify theoretical dimerization complex for future studies. This research aims to elucidate the unique role OSM plays in ER+ and ER- breast cancer and will provide a molecular understanding of how this occurs and will provide detailed information on which patients will benefit most from anti-OSM therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Cytokines,Metastasis,Estrogen receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Cody L.

Early diagnosis, systemic treatment, and surgical resection are interdependently essential in improving survival. However, 20-30% of patients who undergo primary tumor resection will experience a metastatic recurrence in the liver within six months of surgery, despite no substantial differences in clinical history. This &#8220;rapid recurrence&#8221; (rrPDAC) is poorly understood. These metastatic lesions have a few possible origins, including occult synchronous metastases and disseminated metachronous lesions. We hypothesize metastases from either origin are affected by systemic and microenvironmental changes due to surgical intervention. RNA-seq of human rrPDAC primary tumors identified increased expression of Myc-targets when compared to long-term non-recurrers. Here, we describe a novel mouse model of immune competent, surgically resected PDAC that models rapid recurrence. Utilizing novel cell lines derived from our lab&#8217;s inducible, p48-Cre-recombinase driven LSL-KrasG12D\/+ LSL-ROSA-MYC+\/+ (KMC) mouse model, we orthotopically implanted KMC tumor cells into the pancreas of immune competent mice and monitored tumor growth and liver metastases weekly for two weeks via ultrasound. Mice taken down at day 14 (pre-surgery) did not demonstrate micrometastases on serial liver sectioning, however circulating tumor cells were present and isolated from venous blood. Experimental mice were randomized into control (n=17), distal pancreatectomy (n=14), and sham laparotomy cohort (n=14) and metastases were tracked via ultrasound twice-weekly. Surgically resected and sham surgery mice developed liver metastases a median 12 days earlier than controls. Additionally, using cell lines derived from the more traditionally studied KPC mouse model of PDAC (Kras activating mutation and p53 loss of function mutation) and the surgical model described above, distal pancreatectomy (n=13) resulted in metastasis to the liver in a median of 9 days earlier than controls (n=12).In the rrPDAC KMC model, RNA-sequencing of liver parenchyma of mice one day after surgery showed significantly elevated levels of Saa1 mRNA compared to nonoperative controls. This is indicative of a systemic inflammatory response after surgery that we hypothesize is having pro-metastatic effects on the liver, which has been previously reported (1).This model will allow for investigation into rrPDAC and the role surgery plays in exacerbation of metastasis in humans. Our goal is to inform changes in pre- and\/or post-operative standards of care for pancreatic resection surgery to reduce the risk of rapid liver metastasis following pancreas resection surgery.References:1.

Here, to overcome this limitation, we developed an <i>in vivo<\/i> approach with human glioblastoma spheroid lines multiplexed for mouse intracranial xenografts. We validated this with 20 patient-derived models and identified, by 3&#8217;end single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) coupled with deconvolution analysis, <i>in vivo<\/i> models capable of infiltrating along the periphery of either neurons or blood vessels. We previously found that the diverse malignant cells in glioblastoma specimens exist in a limited set of four cellular states: neural progenitor-like (NPC-like), oligodendrocyte progenitor-like (OPC-like), astrocyte-like (AC-like), and mesenchymal-like (MES-like), with potential for state plasticity under the influence of tumor microenvironment. To determine whether or not the cell state heterogeneity is implicated in glioblastoma invasion, we profiled and characterized programs, states, and clonality of invading glioblastoma cells by comparing cells from the contralateral invasive edge to their counterparts residing at the original bulk tumor. This analysis showed evidence of a bi-directional state transitioning model for cells undergoing distinct environmental spaces. Exploration of cell state distribution at the primary tumors revealed that presence of an OPC-like state was significantly associated with invasion phenotype regardless of the infiltration routes. Our results suggest that cellular plasticity may be a prerequisite for the topographically diffusive nature of glioblastoma, urging further assessment by perturbing critical regulators of the cellular state programs. In conclusion, this work describes multiplexed in vivo models as an enabling platform for the rapid interrogation of patient-derived xenografts, coupling the molecularly measurable states with functional identity driving malignant phenotypes such as cancer invasion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Invasion,Intratumoral heterogeneity,Single cell,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Toshiro Hara<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Rony Chanoch-Myers<sup>2<\/sup>, Alissa Greenwald<sup>2<\/sup>, Lillian Bussema<sup>1<\/sup>, Jinan Behnan<sup>3<\/sup>, Rossella Galli<sup>4<\/sup>, Hiroaki Wakimoto<sup>1<\/sup>, Itay Tirosh<sup>2<\/sup>, Mario Suvà<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel,<sup>3<\/sup>Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY,<sup>4<\/sup>San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bf5143d0-439d-427f-9898-d0d25e87ace3","ControlNumber":"7543","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.
