[{"Abstract":"Background: XPO1 is a nuclear export receptor responsible for exporting &#62;200 proteins out of the nucleus, including many cancer-related proteins. We previously reported recurrent hotspot mutations occurring in XPO1 in cancer and identified <i>XPO1<\/i> R749Q variant only in solid tumors. To determine the prevalence of XPO1 mutations across cancer types, we performed a large-scale genomic analysis of 217,570 patients with cancer to identify and characterize <i>XPO1 <\/i>variants from real-world patient tumors.<br \/>Methods: Solid tumor samples representing 14 cancer types were submitted to Caris Life Sciences (Phoenix, AZ) for Next-generation sequencing of DNA (592 genes or WES). TMB-High (defined as <u>&#62;<\/u>10 mt\/MB) and dMMR\/MSI-H was tested by IHC\/NGS. We engineered CRISPR knock-in HCT116 and LS-174T colon cancer isogenic cell lines bearing XPO1 R749Q mutations and Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) analysis was performed. Structural modeling was performed with published XPO1 structures by mapping XPO1 mutations from the MSKCC-IMPACT dataset.<br \/>Results: A total of 96 patients with <i>XPO1<\/i> R749Q mutations were identified (50% occurred in endometrial cancer and 23% occurred in colorectal cancer). TMB-H was observed in 92% of <i>XPO1<\/i> R749Q mt tumors (9% were dMMR\/MSI-H), while 86% of <i>XPO1<\/i> R749Q mt tumors were <i>POLE<\/i>-mutated within the endonuclease domain. Median variant allele frequency for <i>XPO1<\/i> R749Q mt and <i>POLE<\/i> mt were 25% and 29%, respectively. STORM imaging revealed that <i>XPO1<\/i> R749Q mutant cells had significant localization of <i>XPO1<\/i> in the cytoplasm compared to <i>XPO1<\/i> WT cells, especially at the outside edge of the nuclear pores. Structural modeling predicted that <i>XPO1<\/i> R749Q mt affected the regulatory H9-loop of XPO1 favoring increased shuttling and retention in the cytoplasm. Mass spectrometry analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionated proteomes confirmed that <i>XPO1<\/i> R749Q mt cells had increased export of proteins compared to <i>XPO1<\/i> WT cells. A library screen of &#62;200 FDA-approved drugs revealed a strong therapeutic resistance of <i>XPO1<\/i> R749Q cells, especially to chemotherapies used in the treatment of colon cancer. XPO1 inhibition with selinexor synergized with chemotherapy in <i>XPO1<\/i> R749Q mt cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and overcame resistance to irinotecan <i>in vivo<\/i> in xenograft mice models.<br \/>Conclusion: This study sheds novel insights into the role of nuclear export in cancers. Specifically, <i>XPO1<\/i> R749Q mutations are enriched in TMB-H endometrial and colon cancers and increase nuclear export of key proteins that confer resistance to therapies using DNA-damaging agents. Our current work aims to identify novel therapies that can overcome resistance to DNA-damaging therapies seen in <i>XPO1<\/i> mutant cells, such as immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy given the co-occurrence with <i>POLE<\/i> mutations and recent reports of high level of response to ICI therapy in TMB-H and <i>POLE <\/i>mt colorectal cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nuclear-cytoplasmic transport,Chemoresistance,Tumor mutational burden,AACR Project GENIE,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tulasigeri  M.

Here, we used a systems biology approach and the MDA-MB 231 model to compare metabolic fluxes used by parental breast cancer cells and their brain- and lung-homing derivatives. We combined metabolomic profiling, flux measurements, spatial tissue mimetic systems, and mathematical modeling to dissect the cells&#8217; metabolic rewiring, and identified changes specific for lung metastatic selection. We validated our results in other cell lines as well as patient data from project GENIE and the MBCP. Our results produced five biological insights: First, levels of mRNA and metabolic intermediates may <i>anticorrelate<\/i> with flux. Second, different lineages evolved from the same line can have distinct heritable metabolic fluxes. Metastatic lineages in our model display higher glycolytic flux and bioenergetics than parental cells, with lung-homing cells exhibiting by far the greatest glucose uptake and lactate production. Importantly, this occurs despite low levels of glycolytic intermediates in lung-homing cells. Third, this apparent paradox can be reconciled if feedback inhibition of the glycolysis pathway is prevented, a finding we modeled with flux-balance analysis and confirmed by <sup>13<\/sup>C glucose tracing and measuring glycolytic enzymatic activities directly. Fourth, this distinct metabolic behavior in lung-homing cells is maintained by a high ratio of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) gene expression, which also correlates with lung metastases in patients with breast cancer. Feature classification models trained on clinical characteristics alone were unable to predict tropism; however, the LDH\/PDH ratio was a significant predictor for lung but not brain metastases, independent of other transcriptomic signatures, suggesting that this feature is a potential biomarker for lung metastasis. Fifth, this metabolic effect did not increase cellular growth rate, suggesting that lactate secretion may itself be a trait under selection in breast cancer lung metastasis. Follow up experiments and game theory-based models in a spatially structured tissue-mimetic system showed that lung-homing cells grow more favorably than brain-homing cells in nutrient-deprived gradients, demonstrating how divergent metabolisms of the lineages could lead to selection in different environments. Notably, lung metastases in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer had higher lactate production than other metastases, suggesting that this metabolic trait could be important for other cancer types. Together, our <i>in vitro<\/i>, <i>in silico<\/i>, and clinical data analyses highlight that metabolism&#8212;currency of all physiological processes&#8212;plays an essential role in the connection from gene to phenotype in metastatic disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AACR Project GENIE,Metabolism,Metastasis,Mathematical modeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Deepti Mathur<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chen Liao<sup>1<\/sup>, Wendy Lin<sup>1<\/sup>, Alessandro La Ferlita<sup>2<\/sup>, Salvatore Alaimo<sup>2<\/sup>, Alfredo Ferro<sup>2<\/sup>, Yi Zhong<sup>3<\/sup>, Christine Iacobuzio-Donahue<sup>1<\/sup>, Joao Xavier<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Catania, Catania, Italy,<sup>3<\/sup>Hackensack Meridian Health Center for Discovery and Innovation, Hackensack, NJ","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2cd16bf0-5347-4f90-96e5-9df2dd0a3152","ControlNumber":"1883","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

Pancreatic adenocarcinomas have been historically difficult to treat, in part due to lack of early detection, and due to their resistance to conventional chemotherapy. There has recently been an improved understanding of the biologic processes driving pancreatic tumorigenesis, and an increase in clinical trial options available to patients, especially in the context of KRAS mutation positive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). KRAS is a known driver of pancreatic cancer initiation, with concurrent loss of TP53 in many cases. Among all mutated genes in pancreatic cancer, KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4 are most frequently reported, followed by CDKN2B and ARID1A among others. Mutations in TP53 commonly found in pancreatic cancer are either missense or truncating. The specific type of mutation may be important to note since point mutations may produce dysfunctional proteins that acquire gain of functions that are tumor-promoting, although the most well-agreed upon effects of TP53 mutations stem from the absence or decrease of its normal physiologic functions including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis promotion, DNA damage response triggering, maintenance of cell polarity, and maintenance of genomic stability. Here we present an in-depth multi-dimensional analysis of 29 pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients, consisting of 11 patients with KRAS G12D mutations, 5 patients with KRAS G12V mutations, 3 patients with non-canonical KRAS mutations, and 10 patients with no KRAS mutations identified in their tumors. Individual TP53 mutations were highlighted in the context of associated KRAS mutations and tumor genomic landscape at the time of testing. Real-world data was collected with patient consent through community embedded Oncology Clinical Team (ceOCT) facilitated engagement. Tumor evolution prediction rules were constructed based on mutational landscapes of the 29 patients and evidence published in peer-reviewed journals. Pancreatic cancer patient data from the AACR GENIE Cohort v12.0-public database and the cBioportal for Cancer Genomics public site was subsequently used for testing predicted tumor evolutionary trajectories. Here we describe multiple independent combinations of KRAS and TP53 mutations leading to convergent functional outcomes for tumor cells, in the context of patient-specific gene mutation landscapes. Recurrent patterns of paired mutations with common cellular function dysregulation outcomes highlight core underlying mechanisms of pancreatic tumor evolution.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Clinical informatics and data science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,TP53,AACR Project GENIE,Carcinogenesis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kaumudi Bhawe<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Adrienne Nugent<sup><\/sup>, Deb Christensen<sup><\/sup>, Lauren Levine<sup><\/sup>, Emma Shtivelman<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Cancer Commons, Mountain View, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a15a4131-04df-43ae-af66-98a63cce9d2d","ControlNumber":"2740","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

This study demonstrates the applicability of an emerging method in survey science (Multilevel Regression and Poststratification (MRP)), which leverages common covariates across source data and larger, more representative set of observations to inform estimates of biomarker prevalence for target populations of interest.<br \/>Methods<br \/>In disease-agnostic cohorts of patients with solid-tumor cancers from two, large clinico-genomic cancer databases (AACR GENIE 12.0, and nationwide (US-based) de-identified Flatiron Health - Foundation Medicine Clinico-Genomic Database(CGDB)), we used covariate-adjusted regression (age, sex, race, stage at diagnosis (for CGDB patients), and cancer type) to predict the probability of a patient having an NTRK fusion and\/or a BRAF V600E mutation detected in their sequenced cancer tissue. AACR Project GENIE (n = 118,649) is a cancer registry of real-world data assembled through data sharing between 19 international cancer centers. The de-identified data in the CGDB (n = 91,719) originated from approximately 280 US cancer clinics (~800 sites of care).We then implemented post-stratification adjustments (Gelman, 2006; Downes 2018) using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 17 2022 cancer registry to estimate prevalence of the alterations in the large, population-based registry.<br \/>Results<br \/>Prevalence estimates were generally consistent between sources. Adjusted prevalence (%) estimates for NTRK Fusion (AACR: 0.25% (raw), adjusted to 0.21% (0.01%-0.48%) (MRP-adjusted mean % (95% quantile intervals)); CGDB: 0.29, adjusted to 0.26 (0.02-0.63), and for BRAF V600E (AACR: 2.19, adjusted to 1.72 (0.77-2.66); CGDB: 2.44, adjusted to 2.68 (1.50-3.89)) reflected differential patient characteristics (predominantly tumor type) in these sources compared to SEER. MRP also enabled creation, from posterior distributions, of tumor-level estimates, along with credible interval bounds.<br \/>Conclusion<br \/>While both clinico-genomic databases offered generally consistent estimates of biomarker prevalence, representativeness methods that are used in the survey literature may be suited for addressing biases in RWD sources to improve biomarker prevalence estimates of target populations of patients with cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-01 Analyses using clinico-genomic databases,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AACR Project GENIE,Biomarkers,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jeremy  W.

Although antineoplastics given at a single institution may be available in research-ready format, treatment at external institutions prior to receiving care at academic medical centers, common among patients at these centers, is often only described in free-text clinical notes, necessitating manual curation for downstream analysis. To overcome this bottleneck, we trained and validated natural language processing (NLP) models using initial consult notes to identify whether patients had received treatment at external institutions and studied the impact of these putative treatments on tumor genomics.<br \/>Training data were derived from the AACR Project GENIE Biopharma Collaborative (BPC) for 2,663 patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) across four cancer types. For each patient, we selected initial visits with medical and radiation oncologists based on an a priori note prioritization scheme and determined &#8220;ground-truth&#8221; prior external medications based on manually curated BPC administration records, whitelisting MSK-given medications. We trained logistic regression and clinical longformer models to identify external treatment receipt and evaluated model performance with 5-fold cross-validation. The clinical longformer model performed best across evaluation metrics, with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.972, macro-averaged precision\/recall of 0.854\/0.902 and macro-averaged F1 score of 0.876. Re-review of discrepant cases suggested that 75% of &#8220;false positives&#8221; may be due to curation error.<br \/>We used our model to infer treatment status in a pan-cancer cohort with tumor genomic profiling using our institutional sequencing platform. Out of 48,447 patients, 11,900 were predicted to have received external treatment. Patients with putative external treatment had higher alteration frequencies in resistance-related genes than untreated patients and comparable to known pre-treated patients, including ESR1 in patients with breast cancer, AR in patients with prostate cancer, and EGFR T790M in patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. Patients with putative external treatments, similar to known pre-treated patients, had shorter survival compared to treatment-na&#239;ve patients of the same cancer type.<br \/>NLP can abstract external treatment status from clinical notes. When applied at scale, our model could help mitigate confounding variables and identify relationships between clinicogenomic variables and anticancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-02 Clinical informatics and data science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AACR Project GENIE,Natural language processing,Clinical data mining,Cancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Thinh  N.

Current immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) have had modest impact for OC treatment; with anti PD-1\/PD-L1 single therapies reported response rates of 4-15%. Accordingly, additional approaches are important for these patients. Natural killer (NK) cells represent an important subset of effector lymphocytes with strategic approaches for maximizing NK reactivity to target OC are likely important. Of interest, an inhibitory receptor and glyco immune checkpoint<b>- <\/b>Siglec 7 is expressed on 100% of peripheral blood and umbilical cord NK cells<b>. <\/b>We have generated antibodies against Siglec 7 through an optimized human Siglec 7 DNA\/protein immunization approach in humanized next generation transgenic mice. By high throughput flow screening, we identified several Siglec 7 antibodies and down selected relevant clones. A unique clone DB7.2 was highly specific for Siglec 7. We demonstrated the ability of DB7.2 (human IgG1) to activate NK cells and induce OC cell killing using xCELLigence RTCA for in vivo OC challenge studies. DB7.2 (1&#956;g\/ml) bound to &#62;90% of NK cells including both CD56dim and CD56bright subsets, evaluated in the PBMCs of multiple donors. It showed strong binding to recombinant Siglec 7 and Siglec 7 transduced HEK293T but not to wild type 293T cells supporting specificity. DB7.2 induced specific killing of multiple OC lines (OVCAR3&#38;10,TOV21G, CaOV3, OVISE, PEO4) carrying different mutations; BRCA1&#38;2, AKT, TP53, PIK3CA, BRAF etc. and resistant against a wide array of cancer drug targets; HSP90, HDAC, MTORC, DNA alkylating agents, EGFR, PARP, PI3K, and WEE1. Tumor killing was indicated to be mediated via enhanced secretion of soluble Fas, perforin, granulysin as well as granzyme A. Of note, OVISE (BRCA1mutated) and PEO4 (BRCA2 mutated, PARPi resistant) were susceptible to DB7.2 killing with EC50- 82.67 and 68.67 nM respectively. A single dose of in vivo expressed DB7.2 significantly reduced the tumor burden in an OVISE challenged humanized mice model enhancing median survival by 57 days. As OCs are highly diverse in nature and likely to require combinatorial approaches for simultaneous targeting of immune pathways; we combined DB7.2 with anti-PD1 for further investigation. In xCELLigence assay, anti-PD1 demonstrated killing of PEO4 cells with EC50 680 nM. The combination of anti PD-1 with DB7.2 showed further enhancement of OC killing in the presence of human PBMCs. This is the first demonstration of the impact of Siglec 7 targeting mAb alone as well as in combination with anti-PD1 (NK and T cell CPIs) studied for targeting OC or any human tumor. These studies have important implications for tumor therapy and provide a novel non T cell CPI potential approach to augment current immune therapy strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Global Health,Immune checkpoint,AACR Project GENIE,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Devivasha Bordoloi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Abhijeet  J.

They have also emerged as mechanisms of acquired resistance to other targeted therapies. The genomic landscape of <i>RET<\/i> fusions and the impact of co-occurring genomic alterations on the efficacy of selective RET inhibitors is yet to be fully described.<br \/>Methods: A total of 678 <i>RET<\/i> fusion-positive samples were analyzed from three cohorts: Guardant360&#174; circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) (n=467), tissue and\/or plasma from the American Association for Cancer Research Project Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (AACR Project GENIE) non-squamous NSCLC cohort (n=161), and the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) cohort of patients treated with selpercatinib or pralsetinib (n=50). Molecular characteristics were compared across all three cohorts and to the entire non-<i>RET<\/i> non-squamous NSCLC AACR Project GENIE cohort (n=17770). Fisher&#8217;s exact test was used to evaluate the difference in response rate between patient groups, and Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate hazard ratios for time-to-event endpoints for patients in the MDACC clinical cohort (n=51, 50 patients with<i> RET<\/i> fusion, 1 patient with <i>RET <\/i>point mutation).<br \/>Results: The most common fusion partner in all cohorts was <i>KIF5B<\/i> (ctDNA: 73%; GENIE: 69%; MDACC: 71%), followed by <i>CCDC6<\/i> (19%; 17%; 18%) and <i>NCOA4<\/i> (5%; 1%; 7%). Across all cohorts, co-mutations in <i>TP53<\/i> were most common (60%; 34%; 40%) and <i>EGFR,<\/i> <i>CDKN2A\/B<\/i>, <i>MET<\/i>, and <i>ATM<\/i> consistently co-occurred across all cohorts. <i>EGFR<\/i><i> <\/i>co-occurred more frequently with non-<i>KIF5B<\/i> fusion partners (chi-square p &#60; 0.006). <i>MYC<\/i> and <i>CCND1<\/i> amplifications were enriched in all three cohorts compared to the non-<i>RET<\/i> cohort. In the MDACC clinical cohort (n=51), the majority were female, never-smokers, with adenocarcinoma histology. The median follow-up time was 28.3 months (95% CI: 15.2 ~ 35 months). Overall response rate (ORR) was 74.4% (95% CI: 58.8 ~ 86.5%), where patients with <i>TP53<\/i> mutation had numerically lower ORR compared to patients without <i>TP53<\/i> mutation (58.5% vs. 87.5%; p = 0.0632). Median progression-free survival (PFS) time was 16.5 months (95% CI: 13.5 ~ 27.4 months) and <i>KIF5B<\/i> fusions trended towards worse PFS outcome compared to non-<i>KIF5B<\/i> fusions (HR: 2.24; 95% CI: 0.88 ~ 5.67; p = 0.0896). <i>TP53<\/i> alterations were associated with a significantly worse overall survival (OS) (HR: 2.93; 95% CI: 1.08 ~ 7.95; p = 0.0346).<br \/>Conclusion: In the largest <i>RET<\/i> fusion-positive NSCLC cohort to date, <i>RET<\/i> fusions frequently co-occurred with other genomic alterations, most commonly in <i>TP53<\/i>. <i>TP53<\/i> alterations are associated with a significant reduction in overall survival in patients treated with the selective <i>RET<\/i> inhibitors.

Based on drug-response, sensitivity and resistance profiles, a biomarker signature for IMM-1-104 was developed in order to project potential therapeutic response of cancer patients found in the AACR Project GENIE (GENIE) database.<br \/><b>Experimental Procedures:<\/b> Humanized 3D preclinical models better predict <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor responses versus 2D culture and more accurately replicate biology of human tumors. Therefore, the antitumor activity of IMM-1-104 was evaluated in over 130 tumor models spanning 12 distinct histologies in the humanized 3D tumor growth assay (3D-TGA). Cell-based whole exome sequencing readouts were combined with 3D-TGA results to build a pharmacogenomic response algorithm. When applied to the GENIE patient database, resultant tumor-specific response landscapes helped to inform an early pan-RAS clinical trial design for IMM-1-104.<br \/><b>Summary of New Data:<\/b> A machine learning model was developed to predict IMM-1-104 sensitivity using response-associated genes and signaling networks that were identified using 3D-TGA pharmacogenomics data. This model was used to estimate GENIE patient IMM-1-104 response profiles across key solid tumor indications. In addition, mutation constellations from GENIE were compared with those observed in cell lines to identify preclinical models that best resemble real-world patients. This effort was designed to further enrich the translational fidelity of specific tumor models with the goal of translationally identifying patient populations most likely to benefit from IMM-1-104 treatment.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The depth of response to IMM-1-104 was evaluated across a panel of diverse 3D-TGA tumor models and led to identification of a biomarker signature for therapeutically addressable MAPK pathway addiction. To translate these findings into a relevant clinical application, a response algorithm was developed and applied to the GENIE database, which has cataloged the molecular profiles of over 100,000 cancer patients. Mutational landscapes of patients within GENIE helped identify preclinical models that better represent patient profiles likely to be encountered in the clinic. This approach could, as a general principle, be applied as a tool for improving biomarker discovery and clinical translation of oncology drugs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-03 Pharmacogenetics and therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AACR Project GENIE,Ras,3D cell culture,Pharmacogenomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Praveen Nair<sup>1<\/sup>, Jason Funt<sup>1<\/sup>, Sarah Kolitz<sup>2<\/sup>, Jan de Jong<sup>1<\/sup>, Peter  J.

The most often mutated gene in PCa is PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog), making it a possible biomarker for prospective customized therapy. The root causes of health inequalities in PCa have not received much attention. Numerous online databases, like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), provide gene expression data and other data, allowing researchers to further investigate new processes or therapy options. However, there hasn't been much study on tailored therapy up to this point since there may have been difficulties with access to genomic information and bioinformatic tools.<br \/>Methods: The PCa data in cBioPortal comprises 494 samples. We selected 154 samples comprising 7 Blacks and 147 Whites. We used the TCGA database to obtain the PCa gene expression and DNA methylation data for study. In order to examine the data by race\/ethnicity, gene expression, DNA methylation, and genomic changes, we evaluated at the differentially expressed and methylated genes using online tools (cBioPortal). To evaluate gene methylation, expression, and alterations, log ratios of means in Blacks to means in Whites were computed across the data. Additionally, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, protein interaction analysis, and multivariable data analysis were carried out.<br \/>Results: PCa data in the TCGA database showed PTEN mutation in 20% patients. The median age of participants was 63 years (range: 42-78). For every category of data assessed, there were significant differences by race\/ethnicity (q &#60; 0.05). In the survival analysis, SLC2A1, NUDT12, CUTALP, and other genes were associated with survival.<br \/>Conclusion: Genetic alteration, expression, and DNA methylation are each significantly different by the two race groups compared. According to our research, PTEN mutation in PCa may influence several genes and biological processes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-10 Statistical methods,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AACR Project GENIE,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Olumide Arigbede<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sarah  G.
