[{"Abstract":"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide, with a relatively low 5-year survival rate. Although there are some therapies against lung cancer, new effective treatment options are urgently required. Recently during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen that SARS-CoV-2 binds to its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via spike S1 to enter the cells. This study underlines the importance of SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 in inducing death in human lung cancer cells. Interestingly, we have seen that recombinant spike S1 treatment at very low doses led to death of human A549 lung cancer cells. On the other hand, boiled recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 remained unable to induce death, suggesting that the induction of cell death in A549 cells was due to native SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein. SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-induced A549 cell death was also inhibited by neutralizing antibodies against spike S1 and ACE2. Moreover, our newly designed wild type ACE2-interacting domain of SARS-CoV-2 (wtAIDS), but not mAIDS, peptide also attenuated SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-induced cell death, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-induced death in lung cancer cells depends on its interaction with ACE2 receptor. Similarly, recombinant spike S1 treatment also led to death of H1299 and H358 human lung cancer cells. Finally, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) intoxication led to the formation tumors in lungs of A\/J mice and alternate day intranasal treatment with low dose of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 from 22-weeks of NNK insult (late stage) led to induced apoptosis and tumor regression in the lungs. These studies indicate that recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein may have implications in the treatment of lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-10 Intersection of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Cancer therapy,Apoptosis,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Monica Sheinin<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kalipada Pahan<sup>2<\/sup>, Ramesh  K.

As the literature about CBD, especially in vitro reports, is often contradictory, increasing our understanding of its specific<i> <\/i>action on a molecular level will allow to determine whether CBD can become a useful therapy or exacerbates specific cancers in a context-dependent manner. Due to its relative lipophilicity, CBD is challenging to dispense at therapeutic concentrations; therefore, one goal is to identify cannabinoid congeners with greater efficacy and reduced drug delivery challenges. We recently showed that CBD activates interferons as a mechanism of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung carcinoma cells. As factors produced by the innate immune system, interferons have been implicated in both pro-survival and growth arrest and apoptosis signaling in cancer. Here we show that CBD induces interferon production and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) through a mechanism involving NRF2 and MAVS in lung carcinoma cells. We also show that CBDV, which differs from CBD by 2 fewer aliphatic tail carbons, has limited potency, suggesting that CBD specifically interacts with one or more cellular proteins rather than having a non-specific effect. We also identified other CBD-related cannabinoids that are more effective at inducing ISGs. Taken together, these results characterize a novel mechanism by which CBD activates the innate immune system in lung cancer cells and identify related cannabinoids that have possible therapeutic potential in cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-10 Intersection of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Innate immunity,Interferons,A549 cells,Small molecule drugs,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Leticia Stock<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lydia Robinson-Mailman<sup>1<\/sup>, Long  C.

And it has been reported that the targeting strategies for innate immunity should be less vulnerable to viral evolution, variant emergence and resistance. Therefore, the most effective solution to Covid-19 infection has been proposed to prevent and treat severe exacerbation of patients with moderate disease by enhancing human immune responses such as NK cell and T cell. In previous studies, we demonstrated for the first time that &#947;-PGA induced significant antitumor activity and antiviral activity by modulating NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Especially intranasal administration of &#947;-PGA was found to effectively induce protective innate and CTL immune responses against viruses and we found out that &#947;-PGA can be an effective treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 through phase 2b clinical trial. In this study, the possibility of &#947;-PGA as a Covid-19 immune modulating agent was confirmed by animal experiments infected with Covid-19 viruses. After oral administration of &#947;-PGA 300&#956;g\/mouse once a day for 5 days in a K18-hACE2 TG mouse model infected with SARS-CoV-2 (NCCP 43326; original strain) and SARS-CoV-2 (NCCP 43390; Delta variant), virus titer and clinical symptom improvement were confirmed. In the RjHan:AURA Syrian hamster model infected with SARS-CoV-2 (NCCP 49930; Delta variant), 350 or 550 &#956;g\/head of &#947;-PGA was administered orally for 10 days once a day. The virus for infection was administered at 5&#215;10<sup>4<\/sup> TCID50, and the titer of virus and the improvement of pneumonia lesions were measured to confirm the effectiveness in terms of prevention or treatment. In the mouse model infected with original Covid-19 virus stain, the weight loss was significantly reduced and the survival rate was also improved by the administration of &#947;-PGA. And &#947;-PGA alleviated the pneumonic lesions and reduced the virus titer of lung tissue in mice infected with delta variant. In the delta-variant virus infected hamster model, &#947;-PGA showed statistically significant improvement of weight loss and lung inflammation during administration after infection. This is a promising result for possibility of Covid-19 therapeutics along with the efficacy results of mouse model, suggesting &#947;-PGA can be therapeutic candidate to modulate an innate immune response for Covid-19.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-01 Cancer drug repurposing to treat COVID-19,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Human papillomavirus (HPV),poly-&#947;-glutamic acid,Covid-19 treatment,drug repurposing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Chan-Hee Yoo<sup><\/sup>, <b>Jae Chul Choi<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Do Young Lee<sup><\/sup>, Chun-Soo Lee<sup><\/sup>, Young-Chul Park<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>BL Corporation, Gyeonggi-do, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"77dda5cc-bd4f-4fca-810d-eb24515c07c8","ControlNumber":"4031","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

We first studied T-cell mediated response to the Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 69 patients with hematologic and solid cancers, including 18 patients who received prior B-cell depleting therapy. Patients with prolonged COVID-19 clearance, defined by a positive PCR test for longer than 30 days, had a broad but poorly converged CD8+ dominant response and a lacking CD4+ response. To conduct this analysis, we performed bulk T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing of 121 blood samples and tracked over time TCR repertoire statistics such as clonality, convergence, breadth, and depth of COVID-19-associated TCRs during the active and convalescent periods of COVID-19 infection. These SARS-CoV-2-associated TCRs were identified leveraging immunoSEQ T-MAP database (Snyder et al., 2020), a set of TCR sequences derived from COVID-19 patients and experimentally identified as responsive to MHC Class I and II epitopes from the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 strain using the multiplex identification of TCR antigen assay (Klinger et al., 2015). To extend our TCR repertoire analysis to other SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron, we developed a deep learning (DL) method to predict TCR specificities for new SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. This DL approach also permits the identification of SARS-CoV2-responsive TCRs private to an individual. Combining this DL approach with our TCR statistics methodology, we studied the dynamics of T-cell response to COVID-19 vaccinations in a cohort of 50 patients with cancer and analyzed TCR repertoire characteristics associated with different degrees of COVID-19 severity in a cohort of 42 cancer patients who contracted the Omicron. Understanding cellular response to novel infections is critical for patient care in the context of cancer, and our novel DL-based approach can leverage existing datasets to analyze and track response to emerging viral strains.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-05 COVID-19 vaccines and immune responses among cancer patients,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,SARS-CoV-2,Deep Learning,TCR repertoire,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Olga Lyudovyk<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yuval Elhanati<sup>2<\/sup>, Artem Streltsov<sup>3<\/sup>, Quaid Morris<sup>4<\/sup>, Santosha Vardhana<sup>5<\/sup>, Benjamin Greenbaum<sup>6<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Computational Oncology, Weill Cornell Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY,<sup>2<\/sup>Computational Oncology Service, Department of Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY,<sup>3<\/sup>Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University, New York, NY,<sup>4<\/sup>Computational and System Biology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY,<sup>5<\/sup>Human Oncology & Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Hospital Research Laboratories, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY,<sup>6<\/sup>Epidemiology & Biostatistics, Memorial Hospital Research Laboratories, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f2972969-50e7-4cd9-a8f5-2768febe6a0d","ControlNumber":"5536","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>O.

Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) and Smoldering Multiple Myeloma (SMM) are precursors to MM and exhibit altered immune cell composition and function. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the subsequent population-wide vaccination represent an opportunity to study the real-life immune response to a common antigen. Here, we present updated results from the IMPACT study, a study we launched in November 2020 to characterize the effect of plasma cell premalignancy on response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (vx).<br \/><b>Methods<\/b><br \/>We performed: (i) ELISA for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies on 1,887 peripheral blood (PB) samples (237 healthy donors (HD), and 550 MGUS, 947 SMM, and 153 MM patients) drawn pre- and post-vx; (ii) single-cell RNA, T cell receptor (TCR), and B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing (10x Genomics) on 224 PB samples (26 HD, and 20 MGUS, 48 SMM, and 24 MM patients) drawn pre- and post-vx; (iii) plasma cytokine profiling (Olink) on 106 PB samples (32 HD, and 38 MGUS and 36 SMM patients) drawn pre- and post-vx; and (iv) bulk TCR sequencing (Adaptive Biotechnologies) on 8 PB samples from 4 patients (2 MGUS, 2 SMM) drawn pre- and post-vx.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Results<\/b><br \/>Patients with MGUS and SMM achieved comparable antibody titers to HD two months post-vx. However, patient titers waned significantly faster, and 4 months post-vx we observed significantly lower titers in both MGUS (Wilcoxon rank-sum, p=0.030) and SMM (p=0.010). These results indicate impaired humoral immune response in patients with MGUS and SMM.At baseline, the TCR repertoire was significantly less diverse in patients with SMM compared to HD (Wilcoxon rank-sum, p=0.039), while no significant difference was observed in the BCR repertoire (p=0.095). Interestingly, a significant increase in TCR repertoire diversity was observed post-vx in patients with SMM (paired t-test, p=0.014), indicating rare T cell clone recruitment in response to vaccination. In both HD and patients, recruited clones showed upregulation of genes associated with CD4<sup>+<\/sup> na&#239;ve and memory T cells, suggesting preservation of the T cell response in SMM, which was confirmed by bulk TCR-sequencing in 4 patients.Lastly, by cytokine profiling, we observed a defect in IL-1&#946; and IL-18 induction post-vx in patients with SMM compared to HD (Wilcoxon rank-sum, p=0.047 and p=0.015, respectively), two key monocyte-derived mediators of acute inflammation, suggesting an altered innate immune response as well.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b><br \/>Taken together, our findings highlight that despite the absence of clinical manifestations, plasma cell premalignancy is associated with defects in both innate and adaptive immune responses.

One potential complication in pts receiving CPI is immune-mediated adverse events (irAEs) resulting from overactivation of the immune system. It is unknown whether concurrent CPI and Sars-COV-2 vaccine administration increases the risk of irAEs. This retrospective study examined the incidence of severe irAEs in cancer patients receiving CPI therapy at the time of vaccination against Sars CoV-2.<br \/>Methods: Following IRB approval, pts with solid tumors who received any approved CPI since FDA authorization of the COVID-19 vaccine in December 2020 were identified via institutional electronic health record. Pts who received one or more doses of an authorized vaccine within 60 days of CPI treatment were included. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the incidence of severe irAE (one or more of the following: grade 3 AE or above, multi-system involvement, need for hospitalization). Secondary endpoints included time between CPI and vaccination, need for immunosuppressive therapy, and rate of discontinuation of CPI due to irAE. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics.<br \/>Results: 290 pts with bladder, head\/neck, liver, skin (melanoma, SCC), renal, and gynecologic cancer were included in analysis. The median age was 67 years (IQR: 59.0-74.0) and 66% pts were male. At the time of vaccination, 201 pts (69.3%) received CPI monotherapy, 53 pts (18.3%) received combination (combo) CPI therapy, and 36 pts (12.4%) received other therapies (chemo, TKIs, etc.) with CPI. The vaccine manufacturer was Pfizer Bio-N-Tech in 162 pts (55.9%), Moderna in 122 pts (42.1%), and Johnson and Johnson in 6 pts (2.1%). The number of vaccinations received was &#62;\/= 3 in 214 pts, 2 in 64 pts, and 1 in 11 pts. 30 pts (11.5%) experienced severe irAEs following vaccination. The rate of severe irAEs was 10.3% (30\/290) in the total population [6% (12\/201) with CPI monotherapy, 19% (10\/53) with combo CPI, and 22% (8\/36) in the combo CPI-other group]. Severe irAEs occurred after the first vaccine dose in 5 pts (16.7%), second dose in 16 pts (53.3%), and third dose in 9 pts (30%) pts. The median time between CPI treatment and vaccination in pts who experienced irAE was15.5 days (IQR: 10.2-23.0). Hospitalization was required for 19 patients (63.3%). 24 pts (80.0%) required immunosuppressive therapy with a median therapy duration of 98.5 days (IQR 40.2-173.0). 16 pts (53.5%) discontinued CPI therapy following severe irAEs<br \/>Conclusions: In this retrospective study, we observed a 10.3% rate of severe irAE in cancer pts receiving CPI concurrently with COVID-19 vaccines.

However, despite effective COVID-19 vaccines many questions remain about the efficacy of vaccines and the durability and robustness of immune responses, especially in immunocompromised persons. The NCI-funded Serological Sciences Network (SeroNet) is a coordinated effort including 11 sites to advance research on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination among diverse and vulnerable populations. The goals of the Pooling Project are: (1) to conduct real-world data (RWD) analyses using electronic medical records (EMR) data from four health care systems (Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Northwell Health, Veterans Affairs-Case Western, and Cedars-Sinai) to determine vaccine effectiveness in (a) cancer patients; (b) autoimmune diseases and (c) solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR); (2) to conduct meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies from eight SeroNet institutions (Cedars-Sinai, Johns Hopkins, Northwell Health, Emory University, University of Minnesota, Mount Sinai, Yale University) to determine post-vaccine immune responses in (a) lung cancer patients; (b) hematologic cancers\/hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients; (c) SOTR; (d) lupus.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Methods: <\/b>For our RWD analyses, data is extracted from EMR using standardized algorithms using ICD-10 codes to identify immunocompromised persons (hematologic and solid organ malignancy; SOTR; autoimmune disease, including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and SLE).

Although the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in the conduction of clinical trials (CTs), there is a scarcity of data on CT&#8239;participation among cancer patients. We aimed to describe the level of participation in a COVID-19 CT, willingness to participate, as well as trust in sources of information for CTs among persons with and without a previous cancer diagnosis in Puerto Rico.<br \/>Methods:&#8239; Data collected from November 2021 to March 2022 from two cross-sectional studies were merged and used for analysis. Informed consent, telephone, face-to-face, and online interviews were conducted among participants &#8805;18 years old living in Puerto Rico (n=987). Descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis (Fisher&#8217;s exact text and chi-squared test) was done to describe the outcomes of interest, overall and by cancer status.<br \/>Results: Mean age of participants was 41&#177;15.5 years.&#8239; Most participants were women (71.3%), with an educational level greater than high school (89.5%) and with an annual family income below $20,000 (75.1%). Overall, 4.4% of participants (n=43) reported history of cancer diagnosis. Only 1.8% of the population reported to have participated in a COVID-19 CT to receive either a treatment or vaccine; stratifying by cancer, none of the cancer patients had participated&#8239;in a COVID-19 CT, and only 1.9% of non-cancer patients participated. While 37.0% of the participants indicated being very willing to sign up for a&#8239;CT assessing COVID-19 treatment, willingness was higher in cancer patients (55.8%) than among participants without cancer (36.1%).&#8239; Regarding trust in sources of information for CTs, the level of trust (&#8220;a great deal\/ a fair amount&#8221;) was higher for their physicians (87.6%), researchers (87.0%), the National Institute of Health&#8239;(86.7%), their local clinics (82.9%), and a university hospital (82.7%), while it was lower for a pharmaceutical company (64.0%), and for&#8239;friend, relative, or community leader (37.6%); no differences were observed by cancer status.<br \/>Conclusion: While participation in COVID-19 CTs was extremely low in the study population, the willingness to participate was higher among cancer patients.&#8239; Education on CTs and their availability are necessary to increase participation in this understudied group.

All these events might lead to an unquestionable deleterious impact in the prevention of cancer and across the cancer continuum, exacerbating cancer health disparities in the future. Cancer screening plays a critical role in early cancer detection. COVID-19 has significantly hampered screening programs in many countries&#8217; cancer screening infrastructure and services, affecting adherence. Cancer is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Puerto Rico. Limited information is available about the impact the current pandemic on colorectal cancer screening. In this study, we aim to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on colorectal cancer screening in 2020 and assess if this impact varied by health regions.<br \/><b>METHODS: <\/b>This study analyzed administrative data claims from the Public Health System of Puerto Rico which is managed by the Government of Puerto Rico through the Health Insurance Administration. The Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes included for this study were (81528, 82270, G0104, G0105, G0121, G0328, G0464). To assess changes in the numbers of colorectal cancer screening claims between the incurred year (2016 and 2020), Poisson regression was used. Initially, we fitted this model with only the incurred year as the predictor and offsetting the model with the annual average of total insured (univariate model). Based on this model, we estimate the magnitude of association between the number of claims and incurred year using the Prevalence Ratio (PR) of claims. Lastly, Poisson univariate regression model were used for each of the seven health regions (Ponce, Bayam&#243;n, Caguas, Mayaguez, Metro, Arecibo and Fajardo) to assess potential geographic disparities.<br \/><b>RESULTS:<\/b> The numbers of colorectal cancer screening claims significantly decreased by 40% (PR<sub>crude<\/sub>: 0.60, 95%CI: 0.59, 0.62) in 2020 when compared to 2016. However, when adjusting for claim incurred month, sex, health region and offsetting the model with the annual average of total insured, the numbers of colorectal cancer screening claims significantly decreased by 34%, (PR<sub>adj<\/sub>: 0.66, 95%CI: 0.64, 0.67). The numbers of colorectal cancer screening claims significantly decreased in all health regions in 2020 when compared to 2016 (p&#60;0.05). However, the most impacted region was the Eastern region, Fajardo, with a 64% (PR<sup>Fajardo<\/sup><sub>crude<\/sub>: 0.36, 95%CI: 0.30, 0.42) significant decrease in numbers of colorectal cancer screening claims.<br \/><b>CONCLUSION:<\/b> COVID-19 had a profound negative effect on colorectal screening in Puerto Rico.

The Lymphoma Coalition biennial global patient survey collects data on patient experiences, including challenges or limitations patients face in seeking medical attention or access to treatment. Due to Covid-19, patients with lymphoma have experienced high barriers. This study aims to rank the influence of core demographic variables in their ability to predict barriers to lymphoma treatment in 2020 and 2022.<br \/>Methods: The survey was deployed globally to lymphoma patients and caregivers in 2020 &#38; 2022. The outcome variable was the identification of any barrier to receiving lymphoma treatment. Logit regression was used to model the outcome against core demographics. Variable importance was quantified with independent Monte Carlo resampling.<br \/>Results: Barriers were significantly elevated in all regions in 2022 (p&#60;0.0001). Those who are of older age were found to have fewer barriers to treatment: Unit OR = 0.965; 95%CI [0.962 - 0.968]. Age was consistently a variable of high importance across most regions in both survey years (Table 1). In 2022, treatment delay due to concerns over COVID-19 was the second-ranked variable of importance in three regions.<br \/>Conclusions: Barriers to treatment for patients with lymphoma increased dramatically across all regions from 2020-2022. Increased barriers to treatment in those of younger age were an unexpected finding. Heterogeneity in the impact of variables that influence access to treatment appears to be enhanced by participants' psychosocial impacts due to the pandemic. Policymakers and providers should actively rectify access disparities in their respective regions.<br \/>Table 1.

This is proposed to be dependent on a combination of intrinsic patient and cancer factors such as cancer subtype, and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants with differing pathogenicity. However, COVID-19 phenotype evolution across the pandemic from 2020 has not yet been systematically evaluated in cancer patients.<br \/>Methods: This study is a population-scale real-world evaluation of Coronavirus outcomes in the United Kingdom for cancer patients from 1<sup>st<\/sup> November 2020-31<sup>st<\/sup> August 2022. The cancer cohort comprises individuals from Public Health England&#8217;s national cancer dataset, excluding individuals less than 18 years old. Case-outcome rates, including hospitalization, intensive care and case-fatality rates were used to assess the evolution in disease phenotype of COVID-19 in cancer patients. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to compare risk of Coronavirus outcomes in the cancer cohort relative to the non-cancer population during the Omicron wave in 2022.<br \/>Results: The cancer cohort comprised of 198,819 positive SARS-CoV-2 tests from 127,322 individual infections. Coronavirus case-outcome rates were evaluated by reference to 18,188,573 positive tests from 15,801,004 individual infections in the non-cancer population. From 2020 to 2022, the SARS-CoV-2 disease phenotype became less severe in both patients with cancer and the non-cancer population, though cancer patients remain at higher risk. In 2022, the relative risk of Coronavirus hospital admission, inpatient hospitalization, intensive care admission and mortality in cancer patients was 3.02x, 2.10x, 2.53x and 2.54x compared to the non-cancer population following multivariable adjustment, respectively. Higher risk of hospital admission and inpatient hospitalization were associated with receipt of B\/T cell antibody and\/or targeted therapy which also corresponded with an increased risk of Coronavirus mortality.<br \/>Conclusions: The disease phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 in cancer patients in 2022 has evolved significantly from the disease phenotype in 2020. Direct effects of the virus in terms of SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization, intensive care and case fatality rates have fallen significantly over time. However, relative to the general population, people living with cancer and hematological malignancies remain at elevated risk. In order to mitigate the indirect effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in terms of disruption to cancer care, there should be increased focus on preventative measures. Used in conjunction with vaccination and early treatment programs, this will maximize quality of life for those with cancer during the ongoing pandemic and ensure the best cancer outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-07 Effects of COVID-19 on cancer survivorship,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Databases,Mortality,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Thomas Starkey<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Maria  C.

The cohort included community oncology pts diagnosed with advNSCLC between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 (follow-up through March 30, 2022). We extracted US data on COVID-19 deaths from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. We calculated state-level weekly COVID-19 death rates as weekly COVID-19 deaths per state population size from the 2019 American Community Survey. We categorized rates into quintiles based on all weekly rates during the observation period. Analyses were restricted to treated pts and indexed to start of first-line therapy. For rwPFS analyses, first occurrence of progression or death was considered an event, and pts were censored at last clinic note date. For rwTTP, only progression (not death) was considered an event, and pts with no event were censored at last clinic note date. For rwOS analyses, pts who did not die were censored at last structured activity. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between weekly time-varying state-level COVID-19 mortality rates and outcomes of rwPFS, rwTTP, and rwOS, adjusted for age at diagnosis, race\/ethnicity, and state.<br \/>Results: Among 7,813 advNSCLC pts, the median age at diagnosis was 70 years, the majority of the cohort was non-Hispanic White (59%), had non-squamous cell histology (68%) and a history of smoking (87%). Compared to pts living in states with the lowest quintile of COVID-19 mortality rates (Q1), pts living in states with the highest COVID-19 mortality (Q5) had worse rwOS (Q5 vs. Q1: HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.26-1.69) and rwPFS (Q5 vs. Q1: HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05-1.33). No association was observed with rwTTP (Q5 vs. Q1: HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90-1.22).<br \/>Conclusion: In this study of real-world oncology data, we demonstrated the use of publicly-available COVID-19 mortality data to measure the time-varying impact of COVID-19 severity on outcomes in pts with advNSCLC. Higher state-level COVID-19 mortality rates were associated with worse rwOS and rwPFS among advNSCLC pts. The association with increased mortality among pts with advNSCLC may be related to COVID-19-related mortality or other factors such as pre-existing comorbidities which were not explored in this study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-07 Effects of COVID-19 on cancer survivorship,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Survival,Progression,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maneet Kaur<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Christina  M.

It remains unclear which host factors determine disease severity and survival. Given the propensity of clonal hematopoiesis (CH) to promote inflammation in healthy individuals, we investigated its effect on COVID-19 outcomes.<br \/>Methods: We performed a multi-omics interrogation of the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from COVID-19 patients (n=227). We obtained clinical data, laboratory studies, and survival outcomes. We determined CH status and <i>TET2<\/i>-related DNA methylation. We performed single-cell proteogenomics to understand clonal composition in relation to cell phenotype. We interrogated single-cell gene expression in isolation and in conjunction with DNA accessibility. We integrated these multi-omics data to understand the effect of CH on clonal composition, gene expression, methylation of cis-regulatory elements, and lineage commitment in COVID-19 patients. We performed shRNA knockdowns to validate the effect of one candidate transcription factor in myeloid cell lines.<br \/>Results: The presence of CH was strongly associated with COVID-19 severity and all-cause mortality, independent of age (HR 3.48, 95% CI 1.45-8.36, p=0.005). Differential methylation of promoters and enhancers was prevalent in <i>TET2<\/i>-mutant, but not <i>DNMT3A<\/i>-mutant CH. <i>TET2<\/i>-mutant CH was associated with enhanced classical\/intermediate monocytosis and single-cell proteogenomics confirmed an enrichment of <i>TET2<\/i> mutations in these cell types. We identified cell-type specific gene expression changes associated with <i>TET2<\/i> mutations in 102,072 single cells (n=34). Single-cell RNA-seq confirmed the skewing of hematopoiesis towards classical and intermediate monocytes and demonstrated the downregulation of <i>EGR1 <\/i>(a transcription factor important for monocyte differentiation) along with up-regulation of the lncRNA <i>MALAT1<\/i> in monocytes. Combined scRNA-\/scATAC-seq in 43,160 single cells (n=18) confirmed the skewing of hematopoiesis and up-regulation of <i>MALAT1 <\/i>in monocytes along with decreased accessibility of <i>EGR1<\/i> motifs in known cis-regulatory elements. Using myeloid cell lines for functional validation, shRNA knockdowns of <i>EGR1<\/i> confirmed the up-regulation of MALAT1 (in comparison to wildtype controls).<br \/>Conclusions: CH is an independent prognostic factor in COVID-19 and skews hematopoiesis towards monocytosis. <i>TET2<\/i>-mutant CH is characterized by differential methylation and accessibility of enhancers binding myeloid transcriptions factors including <i>EGR1<\/i>. The ensuing loss of <i>EGR1 <\/i>expression in monocytes causes <i>MALAT1<\/i> overexpression, a factor known to promote monocyte differentiation and inflammation. These data provide a mechanistic insight to the adverse prognostic impact of CH in COVID-19.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-11 Risk factors and comorbidities resulting in adverse outcomes for cancer patients with COVID-19,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prognostic factors,Clonal Hematopoiesis,COVID-19,Molecular Mechanisms of Inflammation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Moritz Binder<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Terra L.

Breast cancer is the most frequently detected cancer among women worldwide and our recent studies suggest that the inflammatory state of breast (BrCa) cancer, a byproduct of elevated cytokine expression, induces epigenetic modifications leading to increased recurrence. Ongoing NCI clinical trial data (ClinicalTrials.gov, CCC19, NCT04354701) indicates that among patients with cancer and COVID-19, the mortality is high, and the most prevalent malignancies are of breast [21%] and prostate [16%] origin. Due to the risk of cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is crucial to identify potential mechanisms of hyperinflammation in BrCa patients. In this study, we have evaluated the level of copy number alteration (CNA) of different inflammatory cytokines including IL-8, IL-1b, IL6, IL-8, GM-CSF, TNF-alpha and many others using cBioportal platform which includes over sixty-nine thousand tumor samples (n&#62;69,000 from 213 different studies) from over 33 different cancers. We found that IL-8 has the highest level of amplification in different breast cancers subtypes. Besides, we also analyzed serum samples from BrCa patients, both recurrent and non-recurrent, by different proteomics methods to identify serum cytokines involved in prognosis and recurrence. Comparative data analysis between non-recurrent BrCa against recurrent BrCa patients identified several proteins with very high significance, mostly proteins associated with epigenetic pathways including HDAC9 (P = 0.0035), HDAC5 (P = 0.013), and HDAC7 (P = 0.020). Besides, we identified differential expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune regulators (IL-8, IL-4, IL-18, IL-12p70) that were present only in recurrent BrCa patient serum. Our data indicate that inflammatory processes contribute to epigenetic modifications that ultimately play a critical role in breast cancer recurrence. In terms of COVID-19 associated co-morbidity, the already dysregulated inflammatory state of BrCa patients may increase their susceptibility to cytokine-storm, leading to increased severity of COVID-related complications and increased mortality rate. Specifically, we hypothesize that the identified elevated level of IL-8 in BrCa patients may lead to a higher basal level of inflammation and contribute to the risk of attaining cytokine-storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection, making it a valuable target for future studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-11 Risk factors and comorbidities resulting in adverse outcomes for cancer patients with COVID-19,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Copy number alterations,Cytokines,Interleukin-8,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Alakesh Bera<sup>1<\/sup>, Eric Russ<sup>1<\/sup>, Surya Radhakrishnan<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Hai Hu<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, COL Craig  D.

Leveraging their experience in HPV serology and standards, the Vaccine, Immunity and Cancer Directorate (VICD) at the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNCLR) pivoted to address this unmet need in SARS-Co-V2 serology clinical testing and research. This standardization effort required the collection and processing of large volumes of blood from SARS-Co-V2 infected and uninfected individuals into serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Collaborations with specimen collection sites across the United States were established. Following qualification for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM levels in independent laboratories, VICD assembled reference evaluation panels, which were used to assist the FDA&#8217;s performance evaluation of commercial assays submitted for EUA approval. To date, 185 different shipments of the standard or validation panel have been sent to both domestic and international labs. These materials are also available to the SARS-CoV-2 serology community for assay calibration and performance evaluation which greatly facilitates assay data harmonization. In addition, the NCI Serological Sciences Network (SeroNet) was born from this initiative and expertise, resulting in the establishment of Capacity Building Centers (CBCs) for sample collection from different healthy, cancer and immunocompromised cohorts at Mount Sinai, Arizona State University, the University of Minnesota, and Northwell Feinstein. The NCI and FNLCR simultaneously collaborated to develop a network of investigators focused on advancing research on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination among diverse and vulnerable populations, including cancer patients. Their research has resulted in over 326 peer-reviewed publications. The CBC&#8217;s have enrolled patients in longitudinal studies, resulting in a centralized collection of annotated, well characterized serum, PBMCs and clinical data. Numerous cancer cohorts, but predominantly Multiple Myeloma, are included. Furthermore, technology development was supported at the CBC&#8217;s. Based upon this success, the VICD in collaboration with NCI is pursuing an even more innovative effort in pandemic preparedness to establish a Center for Serology and Data Emergency Preparedness (CESDEP); a global network able to activate and pivot to address pandemic-level threats, while continuing to expand the development of immunological assays that can inform clinical decisions for cancer and other immunocompromised patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++COVID01-05 COVID-19 vaccines and immune responses among cancer patients,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vaccines,Biobank,Immune response,Cohort study,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nancy V.
