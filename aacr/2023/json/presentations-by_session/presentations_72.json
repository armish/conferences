Characterized by a kinase-activated gene expression profile and driven by a variety of genetic alterations involving cytokine receptors and kinases, Ph-like ALL is associated with high rates of residual disease and relapse in patients treated with conventional chemotherapy. In this session, we describe the biology of the major ABL-class and JAK pathway genetic subtypes of Ph-like ALL, discuss current diagnostic testing methodologies used to identify patients, and highlight preclinical testing and bench-to-bedside translation of targeted inhibitor and chemo\/immunotherapy approaches for children, adolescents, and adults with these high-risk leukemias.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute lymphoblastic,Pediatric cancers,Kinase inhibitors,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sarah K.

Genomic-based classification has enabled the stratification of MB into four distinct molecular subgroups: WNT, Sonic Hedgehog, Group 3, and Group 4. Such classification allows a better understanding of these malignancies, which has resulted in a significant improvement in the stratification of clinical trials. Despite substantial progress made in the field, still, 30% of children with MB will relapse. Recurrent disease in MB is commonly metastatic and virtually none of these patients will live beyond the 1-year hallmark. These sobering statistics underscore the largely unmet need for brain tumor therapies aimed at treating or preventing the emergence of relapsed disease. In this session, we will review recent advances in the identification of treatment-resistant pools of brain tumor cells, giving special emphasis to the signaling mechanisms that allow these cell populations to evade therapeutics and expand.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumor stem cell,Medulloblastoma,Recurrence,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jezabel Rodriguez-Blanco<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Despite decades of basic and clinical research, survival for patients with high-risk disease has not improved since the 1970s, remaining &#60;30% at five years. Genomic landscape studies have identified the most frequently occurring alterations, parsing out fusion-negative RMS driven by RAS pathway mutations, and fusion-positive RMS driven by signature fusion genes including PAX3-FOXO1. However, this information has not yet translated into improved outcomes. Here, we highlight multi-institutional efforts to generate new tools for RMS precision medicine, including the NCI FusOnC2 Cancer Moonshot program to target PAX3-FOXO1, the NCI CCDI Molecular Characterization Initiative to analyze every child&#8217;s RMS tumor nucleic acids, and the application of machine learning to RMS tumor images to predict molecular subtype and improve risk stratification.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL02-07 Translational pediatric cancer research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Rhabdomyosarcoma,Drug discovery,Genomics,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Corinne Mary Linardic<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
