[{"Abstract":"Introduction: <i>Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#233;rin<\/i> (BCG) is the standard of care for high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) following transurethral resection. However, patients often have heterogeneous responses. Even among those who initially respond well to BCG, 10-20% relapse. Identification of reliable biomarkers predicting the efficacy of BCG remains an unmet need. En bloc resection is a novel technique representing a substantial advancement in the surgical management of NMIBC. We sought to investigate genomic and tumor microenvironmental (TME) profiles in NMIBC and explore potential predictive markers for BCG treatment following en-block resection.<br \/>Methods: A total of 40 patients with high-risk NMIBC (cTis-T1N0M0) were retrospectively enrolled who underwent en bloc resection followed by BCG instillation. Surgical samples were subjected to NGS sequencing using a 520-gene panel (Burning Rock Biotech, Guangzhou) and multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) assay.<br \/>Results: The cohort had a median age of 63 years, and 80% were male. After a median follow-up of 21.8 months, 19\/40 patients relapsed with a one-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rate of 57.5%. All tumors were microsatellite stable and showed a median TMB of 7.98muts\/Mb. Genomic profiling revealed a high prevalence of alterations in <i>TERT<\/i> (55%),<i> KDM6A<\/i> (32.5%), <i>KMT2D<\/i> (32.5%), <i>FGFR3<\/i>(30%), <i>PIK3CA<\/i> (30%), <i>TP53<\/i>(27.5%), <i>KMT2C<\/i> (25%), and <i>ARID1A <\/i>(20%). TME analysis showed higher proportions of M1 macrophages and CD56 dim NK cells in the tumoral compartment and more intense infiltration of CD8+ T cells, exhausted CD8+T, CD56 bright NK cells, and M2 macrophages in the stromal compartment. Multivariate analysis identified <i>TERT<\/i> C228T mutation (HR=3.28 [95%CI:1.225-8.79], p=0.0181) and alteration in <i>KDM6A<\/i> (HR=2.94 [95%CI:1.040-8.29], p=0.042) as two independent factors associated with inferior RFS. Patients with concomitant <i>TERT<\/i> C228T and <i>KDM6A <\/i>alteration had the shortest RFS (median RFS:5.83months) compared with those who were free of (median RFS: NR) or harbored either one of the two alterations (median RFS:9.13months) (p=0.0022). We also found that tumoral infiltration of CD8+T cells was positively associated with RFS (HR=0.29 [95%CI:0.097-0.885], p=0.0208).<br \/>Conclusion: The study comprehensively depicted the genomic and TME profiles in NMIBC and identified potential predictive biomarkers for BCG treatment. Our findings may facilitate the stratification of patients and better guide the clinical decision-making on the management of NMIBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Biomarkers,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Qi-Dong Xia<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yao-Bing Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Jian-Xuan Sun<sup>1<\/sup>, Chen-Qian Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Jin-Zhou Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhi-Peng Yao<sup>1<\/sup>, Ye An<sup>1<\/sup>, Meng-Yao Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Si-Han Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Xing-Yu Zhong<sup>1<\/sup>, Na Zeng<sup>1<\/sup>, Si-Yang Ma<sup>1<\/sup>, Hao-Dong He<sup>1<\/sup>, Heng-Long Hu<sup>1<\/sup>, Jia Hu<sup>1<\/sup>, Yi Lu<sup>2<\/sup>, Lin Shao<sup>2<\/sup>, Si-Qi Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Zheng Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Shao-Gang Wang<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Burning Rock Biotech, Guangzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"385129ab-4808-4ed7-9fed-05f6607ac803","ControlNumber":"4020","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Q.

BI765063 is a selective anti-SIRP&#945; monoclonal antibody acting as a checkpoint inhibitor of SIRP&#945;\/CD47 axis, promoting anti-tumor immunity through increase of dendritic cells antigen presentation, enabling MDSC differentiation, potentiating macrophage phagocytic\/inflammatory properties and reinstating myeloid cell chemokine secretion and human T cell migration<sup>1<\/sup><b>. <\/b>The escalation phase I study in advanced solid tumor patients (pts) showed preliminary efficacy as monotherapy (MONO), and in combination with PD-1 inhibitor ezabenlimab (COMBO). Our goal was to investigate BI765063 predictive response markers.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>A total of 68 patients (50 in MONO arm, 18 in COMBO arm) have been enrolled. Receptor occupancy (RO) was determined on peripheral CD14<sup>+<\/sup> monocytes. Tumor biopsies were collected before treatment from 44 pts (62%) representative of overall population. Tumor microenvironment (TME) was analysed using a Brightplex&#174; IHC panel comprised of CD68<sup>+ <\/sup>macrophages, CD11b<sup>+<\/sup>myeloid cells, SIRP&#945;, and CD47. NanoString tumor profiling used PanCancer IO360 panel.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>One partial response (PR) in MONO (Hepatocellular carcinoma HCC), and 4 PRs in COMBO (2 endometrial cancer, 1 HCC, 1 iRecist PR in MSS CRC) were observed<sup>2<\/sup>. BI 765063 full RO saturation was achieved in V1\/V1 pts treated with doses of 6 mg\/kg and higher, while V1\/V2 patients showed a more heterogeneous RO ranging between 40-80%, reaching an apparent saturation at doses of 12 mg\/kg and higher. Comparison of pts by best response showed that baseline tumor SIRP&#945;<sup>+<\/sup> expression in CD68<sup>+<\/sup> macrophages and in CD11b<sup>+<\/sup> myeloid cells were higher in PR versus PD pts. High percentage of CD11b<sup>+<\/sup>SIRP&#945;<sup>+<\/sup> myeloid cells at baseline significantly correlated with better OS (p=0.023), while CD68<sup>+<\/sup>SIRP&#945;<sup>+<\/sup> macrophages high expression in TME showed a trend for a better OS but did not reach statistical significance. The CD47 tumor expression did not correlate with the OS.

TPST-1120 was well tolerated and showed signs of activity in a phase I trial as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab (NCT03829436). The objective response rate was 30% (3\/10, all partial responses) in subjects treated at the two highest TPST-1120 doses in combination with nivolumab and included two subjects with renal cell carcinoma previously refractory to anti-PD-1 therapy [1]. We performed ctDNA mutational analysis at baseline and quantified lipid and gene expression changes in post-treatment whole blood to identify potential biomarkers of response.<br \/>Methods: Mutational analysis of ctDNA was assessed using the PredicineCARE&#8482; assay (Predicine Inc.), and lipid analysis was performed by tandem mass spectrometry. Gene expression changes were quantified using the nCounter&#174; PanCancer Immune Profiling panel (NanoString Inc.) supplemented with 30 PPAR-&#945; target genes. Putative clinical response biomarkers were identified as those differentially expressed by patients with partial response (PR) compared to those with progressive disease (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05 by Mann-Whitney U Test). Longitudinal lipid change magnitudes were assessed by Wilcoxon paired analysis (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05).<br \/>Results: Baseline ctDNA mutational analysis revealed that patients with PR or stable disease were more likely to bear mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (<i>IDH<\/i>) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (<i>PTEN<\/i>) compared to patients with progressive disease. Patients with PR demonstrated significant elevations (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05) in multiple genes including those associated with lipid transport (<i>APOE<\/i>), Th17 development (<i>RORC<\/i>) and down-regulation of CD155, a TIGIT ligand. Lipid analysis demonstrated acute changes in free fatty acids (FFA) four hours after first dose (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05). Among patients receiving combination therapy, the highest post-dose elevations in FFA, lysophosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine levels were observed in a PR patient exhibiting the longest duration of response.<br \/>Conclusions: TPST-1120 treated patients with PR demonstrated fatty acid oxidation perturbations and immune gene expression changes as potential biomarkers of clinical benefit.

This chemistry allows for capture and subsequent release of exosomes for immunomodulation and functional studies. We developed an approach for targeting TDEs in patient&#8217;s blood plasma by using the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) antibody, a highly expressed biomarker associated with non-small cell lung cancer.The OncoBean Chip is a high throughput radial-flow microfluidic device designed for the specific isolation of TDEs. The bean shaped micro-nodes allow for a varying shear profile to better capture nanosized particles by positioning them towards the middle curvature. We optimized the device using exosomes extracted from cell culture media by ultracentrifugation. First, the surface of the device was salinized with (3-Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane, as an anchor, following plasma activation of the surface. Then, bonded with 3,3'-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) as a crosslinker, to facilitate the release. Finally, trans-cyclooctene (TCO) is attached as the exposed agent for capture of TDEs. The exosome sample is functionalized with an EpCAM antibody (Ab) conjugated to a tetrazine (Tz) molecule via incubation. The anti-EpCAM-Tz conjugate bonds to surface EpCAM on the TDEs creating a TDE-EpCAM-Tz complex for isolation. The TDEs are processed through the functionalized OncoBean Chip for Ab specific isolation. We tested and validated the EpCAM specific isolation and confirmed TDEs were forming complexes with the Ab-Tz conjugates and not arbitrarily sticking to the nodes. This was done by flowing a sample of TDE-Tz through a functionalized device where little to no capture was expected. Then we evaluated the isolation of EpCAM specific TDEs by using H1650 and A549 exosomes and comparing the capture with CD63, a common exosome marker. Limited capture is expected in the A549 group due to low EpCAM expression for the Ab-Tz conjugate to bind too.Additionally, EV isolation was confirmed and quantified by NTA which reveals capture efficiency up to 90% for the H1650 TDEs. Capture efficiency of the no Ab control was found to be at 30% and below while the A549 control, was found to be at about 20% and below. Hence, our<sup> <\/sup>OncoBean Chip with IEDDA chemistry has successfully demonstrated efficient and specific isolation of EpCAM and CD63 expressing TDEs from two different cell lines. Data from Western Blot analysis and scanning electron microscopy further confirm the physical characteristics and protein expression of the TDEs established by the International Society of Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular vesicles,Immunomodulation,Microfluidics,lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nna-Emeka Onukwugha<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sunitha Nagrath<sup><\/sup>, Henry McEacheron<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Chemical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"537a82f9-3f78-46f9-a292-1822c527ad12","ControlNumber":"7691","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

We identified Protein Kinase, Membrane Associated Tyrosine\/Threonine 1 (PKMYT1) as a novel synthetic lethal target in <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplified cancers. In this genomic setting, PKMYT1 inhibition causes premature mitotic entry, mitotic catastrophe and, in turn, cell death. In pre-clinical models, correlation between CCNE1 copy number, cyclin E1 expression and sensitivity to PKMYT1 inhibition is imperfect. Thus, a deep understanding of <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplification as a predictive biomarker for PKMYT1 inhibition is critical for refining patient selection strategies and strengthening our understanding of the mechanism of action. These learnings will be applied to correlative biomarker analyses in clinical trials evaluating RP-6306, a first-in-class, potent, and highly selective PKMYT1 inhibitor, in tumors with CCNE1 amplifications (NCT04855656, NCT05147272, NCT05147350). In this study, multiple features of <i>CCNE1<\/i> were examined using a combination of whole genome and targeted next generation sequencing (NGS), FISH, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Cyclin E1 levels were evaluated across tumor tissue microarrays spanning 5 tumor indications: triple-negative breast (n=100), colorectal (n=100), gastric (n=100), uterine (n=49), ovarian (n=100) cancers. The highest cyclin E1 protein levels were found in ovarian and uterine malignancies, consistent with indications with high prevalence of <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplification (median H-score ovarian = 125; uterine = 100; gastric = 45; TNBC = 48 and CRC = 24). To explore <i>CCNE1 <\/i>amplification on a single cell level, we established a novel FISH assay using a subtelomeric q-arm control probe. The subtelomeric q-arm band is more frequently diploid than other regions on chromosome 19. Analytical validation of the FISH assay demonstrated sensitivity of 95%, specificity of 95.2%, and overall concordance of 95.1% when compared to a targeted sequencing panel (SNIPDx&#174;). Within the uterine and ovarian cohorts, cancers harboring <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplification were found to display higher cyclin E1 protein levels than non-amplified tumors (p-val=0.0002) and cyclin E1 expression was positively correlated with <i>CCNE1<\/i> copy number (Spearman &#961;=0.67; p-value=4.1e-05). Substantial intratumoral spatial heterogeneity of <i>CCNE1<\/i> copy number when measured by FISH was observed across ovarian and uterine tumors. The potential impact of <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplification heterogeneity, cyclin E1 protein levels and <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplification fragment size on response to RP-6306 in preclinical models are currently being investigated and will be reported.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cyclin E,Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH),Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Immunohistochemistry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Adam Petrone<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Elia Aguado-Fraile<sup>1<\/sup>, Sunantha Sethuraman<sup>1<\/sup>, Adrienne Johnson<sup>1<\/sup>, Ian Silverman<sup>1<\/sup>, Gary Marshall<sup>1<\/sup>, Jorge  S.

The rest of the NACT-treated patients had at least partial relapse but PFI between one to six months.<br \/>Herein, we tested the enrichment of clinicopathological and molecular features in the refractory and reference groups. Furthermore, we studied all NACT-treated patients, using a three-state survival model with primary progression and death as events of interest, and characterized survival associations with Cox regression. RNA sequencing data were used to identify cellular states and pathway activities, with the goal of revealing molecular level differences that drive early resistance to chemotherapy. Whole genome sequencing data were integrated to the gene expression-based results, to identify causal genetic aberrations. Additionally, the molecular features were tested against clinicopathological features and known HGSC driver mutations.<br \/>Our results suggest that the resistance to primary therapy predicts decreased survival, so that the mean time to death was 13.6 months for patients with SD\/PD and about 5 months longer for patients with at least partial response. As expected, a higher pathological chemotherapy response score (CRS) predicted increased time to progression and a longer time from primary progression to death. However, there was only marginal difference in the distribution of the CRS between the chemo-refractory and responsive groups. In a multivariable model, mutation signature-based homologous recombination (HR) deficiency was associated with a longer time to primary progression, whereas the time from progression to death was associated only with loss-of-function mutations in HR genes. Interestingly, tumor mutation burden, whole genome duplication, or the level of tumor cell proliferation were not associated with chemo-resistance or patient survival. Immune cell infiltration in solid tissue samples was very low, except for one responsive patient, and was not associated with chemo-response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemoresistance,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Genomics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Taru  A.

However, response rate to CDK4\/6i combined with endocrine therapy (ET) is only 50% or less, with <i>de novo<\/i> resistance seen in 15-30% in patients with HR+\/HER2- metastatic BC. Therefore, predictive biomarkers that can help select patients who are likely to derive clinical benefit from adding CDK4\/6i to ET are urgently needed to spare non-responders from toxicities and cost. The long-term objective of our study is to design and develop a predictive biomarker assay that can be used on circulating tumor cells for evaluating tumor response to CDK4\/6i [palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib]. In this research, we aimed to select internal controls that can be used for the immunofluorescence (IF) assay to evaluate the expression of Rb and phospho-Rb as potential predictive biomarkers for CDK4\/6i therapy.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: MCF7 and T47D parental (P) cells were treated with various concentrations of abemaciclib and palbociclib to determine their effects on cell growth by automated cell counting using Ensight&#174; Multimode Plate Reader and on Rb and phospho-Rb expression by western blotting (WB) and IF using Leica SP8 STED confocal microscope. We also utilized derivatives of MCF7 and T47D cells resistant to estrogen deprivation (EDR) and\/or Palbociclib (PalboR).<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Abemaciclib and palbociclib treatment resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in cell growth of MCF7 P (IC<sub>50<\/sub>: 37.4 and 254.7 nM, respectively) and T47D P (IC<sub>50<\/sub>: 2.7 and 59.1 nM, respectively) cells. Abemaciclib also reduced the expression phospho\/total-Rb in a concentration-dependent manner by both WB and IF. The IC<sub>50<\/sub> for abemaciclib was 19 nM in MCF7 P and 24 nM in T47D P cells when detected by WB. Similarly, there was a concentration-dependent decrease in the phospho\/total-Rb with abemaciclib treatment as detected by IF. Expression of both total Rb and phospho-Rb was undetectable in the P\/PalboR T47D cells compared to T47D P cells by both WB and IF. Therefore, this cell line can be used as a control for lack of Rb expression. EDR\/PalboR derivative of MCF7 had ~50% reduction in Rb and ~70% reduction in phospho-Rb by IF, supporting its use as a control for reduced Rb expression.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: In summary, we have identified cell line models that can be used as internal controls for detecting the expression of total and phospho-Rb as predictive biomarkers of CDK4\/6i treatment response in HR+\/HER2- MBC patients. Ongoing performance validation studies are underway, including automated quantitation using digital whole slide fluorescent imaging to optimize the throughput and dynamic range of the assay.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Predictive biomarkers,Breast cancer,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,Retinoblastoma protein,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mantasha Tabassum<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Alexis Ruiz<sup>1<\/sup>, Noor  M.

We hypothesized that the detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma could allow for treatment response prediction and longitudinal monitoring. We analyzed serial plasma samples at baseline and within 3 months of start of sotorasib to evaluate ctDNA changes and correlation with clinical response.<br \/>Methods: Pts with sotorasib treated <i>KRAS<\/i>+ NSCLC were prospectively enrolled in our biomarker START-TKI study (NCT05221372) after written informed consent. Plasma samples were collected prior to treatment (T0) and at first response evaluation (T1). The TruSight Oncology 500 ctDNA panel was used for mutation detection in cell-free DNA (cfDNA). cfDNA <i>KRAS<\/i>\/<i>TP53<\/i>\/<i>STK11<\/i>\/<i>KEAP1<\/i> status was determined and compared to tumor tissue pathology reports to filter out false positives. Radiological response and PFS was assessed per RECIST 1.1.<br \/>Results: Between May 2021 and August 2022, 35 pts were included (table 1). Of these, 29 (83%) had detectable ctDNA <i>KRAS <\/i>G12C at T0, and 24 had both T0 and T1 samples. A decrease in variant allele frequency (VAF) at T1 compared to T0 was observed in 88% (<i>n<\/i>=21); 42% (<i>n<\/i>=10) showed complete clearance of ctDNA <i>KRAS <\/i>G12C. Six-months PFS was 83% in T0 negative pts (<i>n<\/i>=6) versus 43% in T0 positive pts (<i>n<\/i>=29); and 65% in pts with complete clearance (<i>n<\/i>=10) versus 14% in pts with incomplete clearance (<i>n<\/i>=11). VAF increase was seen in 3 pts, of which 1 had progression at T1.<br \/>Conclusions: In pts with <i>KRAS<\/i>+ NSCLC treated with sotorasib, baseline ctDNA and ctDNA clearance within 3 months of treatment correlated with treatment response. Pts with undetectable <i>KRAS <\/i>ctDNA at baseline, or with complete clearance at first evaluation, had superior PFS.

Previous reports have established a correlation between irAE occurrence and better CPI patient outcomes, yet these correlations and their underlying biological mechanisms are poorly understood. To better understand the immunological mechanisms behind the correlation of irAE presentation and response, we performed immune profiling on 40 urothelial carcinoma (UC) patients receiving aPD-1 as part of the RADIOHEAD study (Lucas et al. SITC 2022, abstract #1256). A 44-marker mass cytometry panel was used to profile pretreatment and early on-treatment PBMCs to capture cell subsets and functional states across innate and adaptive immune cells. We performed analysis on gated immune cell populations and through unsupervised clustering. Group comparisons were made by adjusted Kruskal-Wallis test, whereas survival correlates were assessed through univariate Cox regression analysis. For clinical outcome analyses, we defined responders as patients who had overall survival greater than 12 months (n=26) and noted 8 patients developed irAEs. Several immune features early on-treatment were associated with overall survival. KLRG1+ naive and HLA-DR+ CD38+ central memory CD8 T cells were negatively correlated with survival, whereas Treg and TIM-3+ classical monocytes were positively associated (HR= 2.6, 3.2, 0.4, 0.05; p=0.0002, 0.00005, 0.01,0.009 respectively). Next, we classified patients into the following groups: responders with irAE (R-irAE, n=5), responders without irAE (n=21), non-responders with irAE (n=3) and non-responders without irAE (n=10). We found that several immune features were unique to R-irAE patients early on aPD-1 treatment. R-irAE patients had up to 30% more CD74+ cDCs, up to 4-fold more TIM-3+ classical monocytes, and had a greater fold decrease in CD16+ NK cells from baseline compared to other patients (p&#60;0.005, 0.001,0.008 respectively). They also had up to 2-fold more Treg cells early on treatment, including a subset of activated Tregs marked by expression of CD38, CTLA-4, ICOS and TIGIT (p=0.05) which trended up to significance at pretreatment (p=0.075). In this study, we demonstrate that high-dimensional immune profiling by mass cytometry can detect novel blood-based biomarkers associated with clinical outcomes. Although CPI response and irAE incidence both require activation of a patient&#8217;s immune system, different mechanisms likely apply. Based on our findings, there are markers associated with responders broadly, as well as specific to R-irAE patients. We plan to validate these findings and identify additional markers and mechanisms of response and irAE with immune profiling on more RADIOHEAD indications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Immune response,Toxicity,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Connor  P.

In tumor tissue from patients with gastric (G) and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma, CLDN18.2 expression has been found to be frequently expressed as determined by gene expression and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Based on its expression pattern in malignant tissues and past clinical studies, CLDN18.2 has emerged as a target of interest for new therapeutics. The goal of this study was to obtain a deeper understanding of CLDN18.2 expression, prevalence, as well as its prognostic implications, clinical characteristics, and relationship with select biomarkers in G and GEJ adenocarcinoma patient samples.<br \/>Methods: Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded tissue samples of G and GEJ adenocarcinoma patients (n=304) from a tissue biorepository at MD Anderson Cancer Center were retrospectively studied for CLDN18.2 expression by IHC (antibody clone 43-14A). Tissue samples included primary G and GEJ adenocarcinoma tissues, matched pre- and post- metastatic samples and matched na&#239;ve versus chemotherapy treated patients. Interpretation of CLDN18.2 expression was conducted by clinical pathologists to score samples based on staining intensity (&#8805;2+) as well as the percentage of positively stained CLDN18.2 tumor cells (&#8805;75% and &#8805;50%). CLDN18.2 expression was analyzed for its association with prognosis, clinical and demographic data and its relationship with other variables (e.g. sex, age, histology, HER2, PD-L1, EBV).<br \/>Results: Prevalence of CLDN18.2 expression at the &#62;75% cutoff was observed in 51% and 35% of samples from G and GEJ adenocarcinoma patients, respectively, with a combined prevalence of 44%. At the &#62;50% cutoff, CLDN18.2 was expressed in 64% and 45% of G and GEJ adenocarcinoma samples, respectively, with a combined prevalence of 56%. CLDN18.2 expression did not appear to associate with prognosis at either CLDN18.2 expression cutoff. Associations between CLDN18.2 expression based upon sex, tumor grade, histology, peritoneal metastasis and signet ring morphology were observed. When evaluating the relationship between CLDN18.2 expression (at either cutoff) and other select biomarkers (MSI, PD-L1, HER2 and EBV), data suggests there is limited overlap.<br \/>Conclusion: Based upon the data from this study, CLDN18.2 appears to be a highly prevalent, but not prognostically associated biomarker in G and GEJ adenocarcinoma patients. Additionally, CLDN18.2 expression appears independent of other biomarkers, however further research is warranted. These data are consistent with prior reports and support CLDN18.2 as a promising molecular target for therapeutics to treat G and GEJ adenocarcinoma patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Gastric cancer,Gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma,Claudin 18.2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Matheus Sewastjanow<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kohei Yamashita<sup>1<\/sup>, Kenneth K.

We conducted a phase I trial (NCT02107963) of GD2 CAR-Ts (GD2-CAR.OX40.28.z.ICD9), demonstrating feasibility and safety of administering GD2 CAR-Ts in children and young adults with neuroblastoma and, for the first time, osteosarcoma. 15 patients aged 8-28 years were enrolled on four dose levels, of which 13 patients were infused. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and administration of up to 1x10<sup>7<\/sup> GD2-CAR-T\/kg was feasible and safe for children and young adults with neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma. At Day 28 following GD2 CAR-T infusion, 23.1% (3\/13) of evaluable patients had progressive disease and 76.9% (10\/13) had stable disease (SD). 3\/10 SD patients remained stable at 60 days post-infusion of GD2 CAR-T, but all patients eventually progressed. Since a major barrier to CAR-T efficacy is inadequate CAR-T expansion, we evaluated CAR-T levels and found that patients stratified into good and poor expander groups, observed across dose levels and associated with pro-inflammatory cytokine signatures in patients. To understand the immune cell contributors to CAR-T expansion, patient pre-treatment apheresis, CAR-T product, and post-infusion samples were evaluated by high-dimensional proteomic (CyTOF), transcriptomic (RNAseq), and epigenetic (ATACseq) analyses. In patient apheresis, good CAR-T expansion associated with more open chromatin and with both proteomic and transcriptomic enrichment of na&#239;ve T cells, while poor CAR-T expansion associated with increased levels of T effector memory (TEMRA) cells and enrichment of myeloid derived suppressor cell (MDSC) transcriptomic signatures. CAR-T products across patients, regardless of CAR-T expansion, demonstrated increased T cell activation proteomic signatures, with enhanced exhaustion transcriptomic signatures in poor expanders compared to good. The most robust cellular correlate to good CAR-T expansion was a population of CXCR3-expressing monocytes in pre-treatment apheresis. Interestingly, this CXCR3<sup>+<\/sup> monocyte population reduced in post-infusion timepoints of good expanders, resembling levels found in poor expanders. Our findings were validated in TARGET-OS patient data in The Cancer Genome Atlas, where high CXCR3 expression was found to be associated with survival benefit in osteosarcoma patients. CXCR3 has been extensively studied on T cells, but its function on myeloid populations is yet to be fully explored. These results are the first to demonstrate that the peripheral immune environment prior to CAR-T administration may effectively predict and modulate CAR-T expansion in patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Monocyte,Multiomics,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tara Murty<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sabina Kaczanowska<sup>2<\/sup>, Ahmad Alimadadi<sup>3<\/sup>, Cristina Contreras<sup>2<\/sup>, Caroline Duault<sup>1<\/sup>, Priyanka Balasubrahmanyan<sup>1<\/sup>, Warren Reynolds<sup>1<\/sup>, Norma Gutierrez<sup>3<\/sup>, Reema Baskar<sup>1<\/sup>, Catherine Wu<sup>4<\/sup>, Franziska Michor<sup>4<\/sup>, Jennifer Altreuter<sup>4<\/sup>, Yang Liu<sup>5<\/sup>, Aashna Jhaveri<sup>4<\/sup>, Vandon Duong<sup>1<\/sup>, Hima Anbunathan<sup>1<\/sup>, Radim Moravec<sup>4<\/sup>, Joyce Hong<sup>4<\/sup>, Roshni Biswas<sup>4<\/sup>, Stephen Van Nostrand<sup>4<\/sup>, James Lindsay<sup>4<\/sup>, Mina Pichavant<sup>1<\/sup>, Elena Sotillo<sup>1<\/sup>, Bita Sahaf<sup>1<\/sup>, Sean Bendall<sup>1<\/sup>, Holden Maecker<sup>1<\/sup>, Steven Highfill<sup>6<\/sup>, David Stroncek<sup>7<\/sup>, Melinda Merchant<sup>8<\/sup>, John Glod<sup>2<\/sup>, Catherine Hedrick<sup>3<\/sup>, Crystal Mackall<sup>1<\/sup>, Sneha Ramakrishna<sup>1<\/sup>, Rosandra Kaplan<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Stanford University, Stanford, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Pediatric Oncology Branch, NCI NIH, Bethesda, MD,<sup>3<\/sup>La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, CA,<sup>4<\/sup>Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA,<sup>5<\/sup>Broad Institute, Cambridge, CA,<sup>6<\/sup>Transfusion Medicine, NCI NIH, Bethesda, MD,<sup>7<\/sup>Transfusion Medicine, NCI NIH, Stanford, CA,<sup>8<\/sup>Black Diamond, Cambridge, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c2287359-074e-4ada-acfa-8057118c6b9b","ControlNumber":"5002","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

The prognosis is poor with median survival of approximately 9 months. The identification of the primary tumor and therapy targets could improve the survival of these patients. We employed the BostonGene Tumor Portrait<sup>TM<\/sup> platform to interrogate 19 CUP cases. Trained on &#62;19,000 samples and validated on 28,000 samples from independent datasets, the machine-learning based algorithm integrates whole-exome and RNA sequencing (WES and RNAseq) analysis to characterize cancer drivers, the tumor microenvironment, potential targets, tumor composition, molecular signatures, and site of origin (94% sensitivity and 99% specificity)<b>.<\/b> The predicted tissue of origin was considered acceptable when it was compatible with tumor histopathology and immunoprofile, and included in the differential diagnosis of radiologic studies. The discovered biomarkers and possible treatments were discussed during our multidisciplinary precision oncology meeting. 16 out of 19 CUP cases (84%) had an acceptable predicted tissue of origin. Two cases lacked clinical evidence to support the predicted primary tumor, and 1 case failed RNAseq. Lung accounted for most of the sites of origin (31%) followed by gastrointestinal (15%) and breast cancers (8%). Other diagnoses included melanoma, uterine, bladder, and renal carcinomas, among others. Except for one case, a clinically significant biomarker or target was found. Those included relevant mutational signatures (<i>e.g.<\/i>, homologous recombination deficiency, DNA mismatch repair), genetic characteristics (high tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability), activating alterations (<i>FGFR1, MYC, ERBB2<\/i> amplifications<i>; NCOA4::RET<\/i> fusion), loss of function in tumor suppressor genes (<i>TP53, FANCA, ATM<\/i>), and gene overexpression (ER). Further, microenvironment analysis characterized the tumor immune infiltrate and the level of RNA expression of PD-L1, PD-L2, and CTLA4. These oncology biomarkers and potential targets are of significant value independent of tissue of origin. In addition, mutations in <i>NF1, KRAS, TP53, MSH2, BRCA1,<\/i> and<i> PTEN<\/i> were found and validated by commercially available targeted NGS panels. Based on CUP tumor profiling by this platform, positive treatment response has been observed in 3 out of 4 CUP patients thus far, <i>e.g.,<\/i> one patient with metastatic disease that showed high TMB and immune infiltrated microenvironment treated with Ipilimumab and Nivolumab had a sustained response. Therapy in oncology is often determined by the tissue origin, making CUP a therapeutic challenge. In this study, we demonstrate the application of an integrative WES and RNAseq platform to not only predict the site of origin, but also to identify relevant biomarkers and therapeutic targets in CUP.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer diagnostics,Cancer genomics,Whole exome sequencing,Cancer markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Majd Al Assaad<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Sigouros<sup>2<\/sup>, Jyothi Manohar<sup>3<\/sup>, Daniela Guevara<sup>4<\/sup>, Zoia Antysheva<sup>5<\/sup>, Daria Kiriy<sup>5<\/sup>, Alexandra Boyko<sup>5<\/sup>, Naira Samarina<sup>5<\/sup>, Nara Shin<sup>5<\/sup>, Viktor Svekolkin<sup>5<\/sup>, Svetlana Podsvirova<sup>5<\/sup>, Noel English<sup>5<\/sup>, Alaina Villarreal<sup>5<\/sup>, Brianna McKenna<sup>5<\/sup>, Cagdas Tazearslan<sup>5<\/sup>, Diana Shamsutdinova<sup>5<\/sup>, Vladimir Kushnarev<sup>5<\/sup>, Troy Kane<sup>2<\/sup>, David Wilkes<sup>2<\/sup>, Manish Shah<sup>6<\/sup>, Barbara Ma<sup>6<\/sup>, Scott T.

However, the benefit of ICIs is hampered by immune related adverse events (irAEs). The frequency of irAEs varies between ICI treatments and cancer types. These irAEs represent autoimmune reactions that can affect diverse organs, with distinct biology, onset, and severity from their de novo autoimmune disease counterparts. Some irAEs could persist and develop into chronic comorbidities, and a subset of severe irAEs could led to death. Yet, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms and no biomarkers are currently available to predict irAEs after ICI treatment.<br \/>We aimed to identify soluble predictive biomarkers of irAE by non-invasive means using high-throughput Olink Proteomics assay. We collected plasma from 31 melanoma patients before ICI treatment. 25 patients developed severe irAE (grade 3 or above) at one or more organ system including hepatobiliary (n=9), endocrine (n=8), gastrointestinal (n=6), skin and subcutaneous tissue (n=6), musculoskeletal and connective tissue (n=5), blood and lymphatic (n=4) and respiratory (n=1) after receiving ICI, whereas 6 patients have no severe irAEs. The relative expression of 1,472 probes corresponding to 1,463 proteins as part of the Olink Cardiometabolic, Neurology, Inflammation and Oncology panels were quantified as Normalized Protein eXpresion (NPX) on a log-2 scale. Two-tailed T-test was performed in comparing the severe irAEs vs no irAE groups to determine the difference proteins and p &#60; 0.05 and FDR &#60; 0.1 was deemed to be significant. Similarly, we performed organ-specific irAEs using the same approach. Proteins were assessed by enrichment analysis using EnrichR.<br \/>Exploratory analysis revealed elevated expression of CD4 and CD8 cell markers such as IL7R, S100A4, GZMA and GZMB in patients that developed severe irAEs. More broadly, pathway enrichment analysis suggest chemokines and cytokine receptor related pathways were enriched in these patients implicating the role of immune system and inflammatory mediators as potential biomarkers of irAE. In particular, the expression of some interleukin family members appears to be a good predictor of irAE toxicity. Interestingly, our analysis revealed irAE at various organ tissues were associated with different set of proteins suggesting an organ specific protein signature.<br \/>In conclusion, we demonstrated the potential utility of soluble protein in the peripheral blood measurement at baseline prior to ICI treatment for prediction of irAE risk. This finding will be evaluated in a larger independent cohort.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Biomarkers,Proteomics,Melanoma\/skin cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Muhammad Zaki Fadlullah Wilmot<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Magdalena Kovacsovics<sup>1<\/sup>, Xuechen Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Samuel Coleman<sup>1<\/sup>, John Marsiglio<sup>2<\/sup>, Berit Gibson<sup>1<\/sup>, Yoko DeRose<sup>1<\/sup>, Qin Zhou<sup>1<\/sup>, Annaleah Larson<sup>2<\/sup>, John Hyngstrom<sup>1<\/sup>, Ben Haaland<sup>1<\/sup>, Siwen Hu-Lieskovan<sup>1<\/sup>, Aik Choon Tan<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Utah Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT,<sup>2<\/sup>School of Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"43bbcbe2-8d3b-4c17-a903-a30041c385ce","ControlNumber":"4646","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Lurbinectedin binds to GC-rich areas of gene promoters, blocks RNA-polymerase-II and induces degradation via ubiquitin\/proteasome machinery. DNA binding of lurbinectedin results in double stranded DNA breaks and DNA damage that leads to cellular apoptosis. Schlafen 11 (SLFN11), a putative DNA\/RNA helicase irreversibly binds to DNA replication forks resulting in replication block and is a predictive biomarker of response to therapeutics that elicit DNA damage including cisplatin, topoisomerase I\/II inhibitors and PARP inhibitors.<br \/>Objective: Evaluate the role of SLFN11 expression in predicting response to lurbinectedin, a DNA damaging agent, in human SCLC cell lines and <i>in vivo <\/i>models.<br \/>Methods: Cytotoxicity assays: SCLC cell lines DMS 53, DMS 114, NCI-H69, NCI-H82, NCI-H196, NCI-H209, NCI-H211, NCI-H446, NCI-H526, NCI-H841, NCI-H889, NCI-H1048, and SHP-77 were tested with lurbinectedin dose range from 100 nM to 0.01 nM. Cell viability was determined by measuring intracellular ATP to determine percent cellular viability and IC<sub>50<\/sub> of lurbinectedin. SLFN11 expression of 13 SCLC cell lines were retrieved as RNAseq values from the DepMap database. RNAseq value &#62;2 was assigned as <i>SLFN11<\/i> high, values &#60;2 assigned as low. Western blot analysis was used to confirm protein expression. The difference in <sup>10<\/sup>log IC<sub>50<\/sub> between <i>SLFN11<\/i> high and low lines is determined using Mann-Whitney test. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy studies: High <i>SLFN11<\/i> (NCI-H1048) and low <i>SLFN11<\/i> (NCI-H889 and NCI-H69) SCLC cell lines were used for xenograft studies in BALB\/c nude mice.

Immunohistochemistry was used to assess SLFN11 protein expression on xenograft tissue.<br \/>Results and Conclusions: Cell viability assays in 13 SCLC models confirm high <i>SLFN11<\/i> expressing cell lines are 4-fold more sensitive to lurbinectedin compared to low <i>SLFN11<\/i> expressing cell lines (&#916;pIC<sub>50<\/sub> = 0.64; p = 0.0451). The <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy data confirms that the <i>SLFN11<\/i> high NCI-H1048 model is more responsive with 90% TGI compared to 35% observed in <i>SLFN11<\/i> low models (NCI-H889 and NCI-H69) at the highest lurbinectedin dose (p-value = 0.006). Efficacy data confirms correlation to SLFN11 protein expression, consistent with the RNA level association. Both <i>in vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity and <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy studies in SCLC models confirm that high SLFN11 expression predicts response to lurbinectedin.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is backbone of treatment for TNBC, and about 50% of patients respond well leading to pathological complete response (pCR). However, the remaining patients develop resistance to NAC and progress to metastatic disease and poor survival in 1-2 years after the initial treatment. Previous studies have performed bulk RNA expression profiling of TNBC patients and identified 5-6 subgroups of patients, however these studies could not resolve expression programs at single cell resolution to distinguish between the tumor cells and different components of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here we performed scRNA-seq of pre-treatment fresh core biopsy tissue samples from TNBC patients in the ARTEMIS clinical trial and compared these data between pCR and non-pCR patients to identify programs associated with response to NAC. We also compared these data to scRNA-seq data from patients with disease-free breast tissue to understand the basic biology of TNBC and identify cell types that are reprogrammed in malignant disease. Using the single cell tumor cell data, we identified 4 archetypes of TNBC which represent patient-level intertumor expression programs: luminal secretory-like (LS), basal\/luminal-like (BL), immunoregulatory (IM), and luminal androgen receptor (LAR). Notably, the archetype BL was associated with non-pCR, while IM was associated with pCR. We further identified 13 metatraits, which are unique intratumoral expression programs that are shared across patients. Across the cancer cells, we identified 13 metatraits such as cell cycling, stress, hypoxia, interferon response, HLA, partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, many of which corresponded to NAC response. In the immune compartment, we found 15 myeloid cell states, 14 T\/NK cell states, and 6 B cell states, several of which corresponded to pCR\/non-pCR. Similarly, in the stromal compartment, there were 4 fibroblast cell states, 4 pericyte cell states, and 7 endothelial cell subtypes, of which several cell states were associated with NAC response. Overall, these data report the natural biology of TNBC patients and malignant cell states that are reprogrammed in malignant disease, as well as their correspondence to NAC response, providing new data to predict which TNBC patients are likely to respond to chemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Single-cell transcriptomics,Chemotherapy response,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Tapsi Kumar<sup>1<\/sup>, Yiyun Lin<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Yun Yan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Shanshan Bai<sup>1<\/sup>, Jianzhuo Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Tuan Tran<sup>1<\/sup>, Min Hu<sup>1<\/sup>, Elizabeth Ravenberg<sup>1<\/sup>, Maia Rauch<sup>1<\/sup>, Alyson Clayborn<sup>1<\/sup>, Alastair Thompson<sup>2<\/sup>, Lei Huo<sup>1<\/sup>, Stacy Moulder<sup>1<\/sup>, Clinton Yam<sup>1<\/sup>, Nicholas Navin<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cee60d34-e39b-4694-a4ca-b2af414b06b5","ControlNumber":"2353","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

Prior studies have shown that MA negatively affects overall treatment efficacy and survival. Despite the clinical significance of MA it has not been studied to any great extent.<br \/>Methods: We collected MA and matched normal tissue samples at autopsy from 20 PDAC patients who were initially diagnosed at stages IIB to IV. Whole exome or targeted sequencing was previously performed on each PDAC. Each MA sample was centrifuged twice at 4000 RPM first and then at 15000 RPM to separate the cell pellet (CP) from the cell-free ascites fluid. We next extracted DNA from the CP, matched normal tissue, and the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from the ascites fluid, and all were submitted to the Genomics Core for MSK-IMPACT, a targeted cancer gene panel representing 505 genes.<br \/>Results: Results of the first five patients are complete and the remaining are in process. Comparison of the CPs and\/or cfDNA to the matched tumor samples indicated 100% concordance for detected variants. However, the somatic alterations of the CP specifically versus the matched cfDNA were divergent in all patients analyzed thus far. Virtually all copy number alterations in all patients were deep deletions (range 66 to 187 cancer genes deleted) affecting multiple DNA repair pathways including homologous recombination deficiency and microsatellite repair.<br \/>Conclusions: Samples of MA, when both the cell pellet and cfDNA are sequenced, accurately represent the genetic features of the matched PDAC tissue and may serve as an alternative mode of sampling for precision medicine. Differences in the genetics of the CP versus the cfDNA suggest polyclonality in the peritoneal space. Moreover, the finding of deep deletions in targetable DNA repair pathways suggest a therapeutic vulnerability for exploration. Given that paracentesis is often performed in the palliative setting and may be performed multiple times over the course of a patients&#8217; management, it also offers an opportunity to determine how clonal dynamics in the peritoneal space change over time. Patients with MA have poor overall survival compared to patients without MA so these patients may benefit from this type of tracking which could potentially help with their treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Ascites fluid,Circulating cell-free DNA,Sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Rajya  L.

HRd results in accumulation of small and large scale genetic alterations across the genome, including allele specific copy number alterations (aCNAs), small nucleotide variants (SNVs), deletions, and structural variants (SVs). Detection of HRd in tumors predicts response to genotoxic drugs such as PARP inhibitors and platinum.<br \/>Genome wide aCNAs such as large state transitions (LST), loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and telomeric allelic imbalances (TAI) in conjunction with <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> mutation detection have been implemented in routine diagnostic testing to identify HRd in tumors. However, these features represent a subset of the genetic signatures predictive of HRd, and we hypothesize that a significant portion of tumors with HRd are missed using these existing assays.<br \/>Whole genome sequencing (WGS) enables the detection of the full spectrum of genetic lesions that arise in an HRd tumor in a single assay. To demonstrate the added value of WGS to identify HRd, we trained and validated a pan-cancer classifier of HRd. A tumor\/normal matched cohort of 321 cancer patients sequenced by WGS was assembled and analyzed as part of a retrospective study, representing 62 tumor types. An unbiased analysis of HRd associated SV signatures revealed the top quartile of samples harboring tandem duplications (Dups) and deletions (Dels) in the size range of 1-10kbp were enriched with <i>BRCA1<\/i>, <i>BRCA2<\/i>, and <i>RAD51C\/D<\/i> alterations. Through curating Dels, Dups, HRd SNV\/InDel signatures, and alteration of HRd associated genes, 37 unique patients were found to have high confidence HRd, out of which 13% had no alterations in <i>BRCA1<\/i>, <i>BRCA2<\/i>, or other HRd genes. We then trained a random forest classifier to identify HRd tumors. The most important predictive features were WGS-specific, namely small deletions with microhomology, SV Dels, and SV Dups.&nbsp;The HRd classifier was validated using an independent cohort of 556 samples from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) study. Of 46 samples with biallelic <i>BRCA1<\/i>\/2 alterations, the classifier achieved high areas under receiver-operator characteristic (AUROC, 0.99) and precision recall curves (AUPRC, 0.96). The aCNA score, the number of segments harboring LST, LOH, and TAI, had similar AUROC (0.96) but lower AUPRC (0.87). There were 11 <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> non-altered cases predicted to be HRd with the classifier which were not identified by CNA scores, in which 10 had at least 1 alteration in an HRd gene, including <i>RAD51C<\/i>, <i>CHEK2<\/i> biallelic alterations and SVs in <i>PALB2<\/i>, Fanconi pathway genes, and <i>ATM\/ATR<\/i>.&nbsp; We conclude that a classifier incorporating the additional mutational features which can only be detected using WGS can achieve superior precision in identifying HRd tumors and, in the future, uncover additional patients for therapeutic options.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Homologous recombination,PARP inhibitors,Whole genome sequencing,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kevin Hadi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Gunes Gundem<sup>1<\/sup>, Max  F.

Most patients were older: 44 (25.7%) &#8804;50 years old, 127 (74.3%) &#62;50 years old. There were 6 (3.5%) patient samples with a <i>CLDN18\/ARHGAP26<\/i> fusion. The fusion was found more often in females (5 of 80, 6.3%) than males (1 of 91, 1.1%) and younger patients (3 of 44, 6.8%, &#8804;50 years; 3 of 127, 2.3%, &#62;50 years). All 6 had diffuse histology by pathology, variably described as poorly differentiated, diffuse, or signet ring subtype. Notably, the 2 patients with mixed histology did not have metastases reported on the pathology report, while the 4 whose histology was described as diffuse or signet ring cell type were metastatic. In all cases the fusion involved exon 5 of <i>CLDN18<\/i> and exon 12 of <i>ARHGAP26. <\/i>Further analysis revealed that five of the fusion-containing tumors had alterations in genes\/pathways known to be oncogenic drivers of cell proliferation, specifically 1 <i>ERBB2<\/i> (2 mutations present), 1 SWI\/SNF pathway (<i>ARID1A<\/i> and <i>PBRM1<\/i> both altered), 2 <i>MET<\/i> (both amplifications), and 1 PI3K pathway (<i>PI3KCA<\/i> altered). The sixth tumor sample possessed no obvious driver alterations: only <i>TP53<\/i> and <i>WRN<\/i> were altered. Five of the 6 tumors had low tumor mutational burden (TMB) and were microsatellite stable, the sixth had intermediate TMB, and none had evidence for genomic instability.

This paradigm is gaining importance during the early clinical lifecycle of a new potential drug to improve patient-centric trial designs, drive clinical success and eventually increase approval rates - enlarging the therapeutic arsenal available for oncology patients.<br \/>To optimize the chance of success with our A<sub>2A<\/sub>R-selective antagonist, EXS-21546 (546; NCT04727138, discovered in collaboration with Evotec), we have identified an adenosine-induced immunosuppression biomarker signature (adenosine burden score or ABS) for clinical trial patient selection that also correlates with checkpoint inhibitor (CI) response prediction in <i>ex vivo<\/i> primary models.<br \/>Here we present transcriptional and functional data mapping adenosine burden at the single cell level, and investigate subsequent modulation through antagonism of A<sub>2A<\/sub>R with 546, combination effects with CI, to prioritize patients for 546+CI therapy.<br \/>Methods: By leveraging disease-relevant primary human tissues together with matched single cell and bulk transcriptomics, we assess adenosine-induced anticancer immune suppression and show initial biological confirmation of patient selection methodology and combination therapy effects with a translatable high content imaging platform (Kornauth et al 2021 &#38; Snidjer et al 2017).<br \/>Results: The ABS detects adenosine rich microenvironments with greater specificity and sensitivity than other published signatures. Validating the ABS in TGCA, we found the ABS anti-correlates with a validated predictor of anti-PD-1 therapy success (TIS, Damotte et al 2019), unraveling that high-adenosine\/ABS cases are among patients least likely to respond to immunotherapy (low TIS). A<sub>2A<\/sub>R antagonism with 546 demonstrated a reduction of the adenosine burden, and restored the CI response potential as addressed by the ABS and TIS, respectively. Further immune reactivation was seen with antagonism of adenosine signaling by &#8216;546 \/ CI combination ex vivo in primary tissues pre-selected with our ABS signature.<br \/>Conclusions: Combining deep learning of single cell functional and multi-omics profiling data of disease relevant primary model systems, we model the association of the immune response potential to A<sub>2A<\/sub>R antagonism in cancer to define a biomarker signature to predict patients likely to benefit from A<sub>2A<\/sub>R antagonism and CI. This will be confirmed and validated retrospectively in an ongoing clinical study of 546 in two cancer indications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adenosine,Biomarkers,Precision medicine,Translation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Isabella Alt<sup>1<\/sup>, Robert Sehlke<sup>1<\/sup>, Anna Lobley<sup>2<\/sup>, Claudia Baumgaertler<sup>3<\/sup>, Maja Stulic<sup>3<\/sup>, Klaus Hackner<sup>4<\/sup>, Lucia Dzurillova<sup>5<\/sup>, Edgar Petru<sup>6<\/sup>, Laudia Hadjari<sup>7<\/sup>, Judith Lafleur<sup>7<\/sup>, Josef Singer<sup>4<\/sup>, Nikolaus Krall<sup>8<\/sup>, Jozef Šufliarsky<sup>5<\/sup>, Lukas Hefler<sup>7<\/sup>, Thorsten Füreder<sup>9<\/sup>, Christina Taubert<sup>1<\/sup>, Andrew Payne<sup>2<\/sup>, Christophe Boudesco<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Gregory Ian Vladimer<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Translational Research, Exscientia, Vienna, Austria,<sup>2<\/sup>Discovery Bioinformatics, Exscientia, Oxford, United Kingdom,<sup>3<\/sup>Clinical Operations, Exscientia, Vienna, Austria,<sup>4<\/sup>Clinical Department of Pneumology, University Hospital Krems, Krems, Austria,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Oncology, National Oncological Institute, Bratislava, Slovakia,<sup>6<\/sup>Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria,<sup>7<\/sup>Gynecological Tumor Center, Ordensklinikum Linz Barmherzige Schwestern, Linz, Austria,<sup>8<\/sup>Precision Medicine, Exscientia, Vienna, Austria,<sup>9<\/sup>Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b3c87d8d-022e-47e6-b88c-ea1b3666b25a","ControlNumber":"1765","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;I.

CCNE1 amplification is common in high grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOC) and is associated with platinum resistance and poor patient outcomes. Importantly, Cyclin E1 overexpression can also occur in the absence of gene amplification in ovarian cancer. Overexpression of Cyclin E1 increases CDK2 activity and accelerates entry into S phase of cell cycle, resulting in replication stress and rendering cells more dependent on DNA repair. WEE1 participates in the DNA damage response by controlling essential checkpoints of the cell cycle, preventing cells from entering mitosis and allowing for DNA repair before cell cycle progression. Thus, we hypothesize that ovarian cancers overexpressing Cyclin E1, either via CCNE1 gene amplification or through other independent mechanisms, are more sensitive to WEE1 inhibition. Here, we tested this hypothesis in a range of preclinical cancer models using azenosertib, a novel, selective, and orally bioavailable WEE1 inhibitor currently in clinical development. Ovarian cancer cell lines overexpressing Cyclin E1 protein (Cyclin E1high) were more sensitive to azenosertib than ovarian cancer cell lines with lower levels of Cyclin E1 protein (Cyclin E1low) inducing significant cytotoxic effects (GRmax &#60; -0.5). In Cyclin E1low ovarian cancer cell lines, overexpression of Cyclin E1 increased sensitivity to azenosertib. In contrast, silencing of CDK2 in Cyclin E1high cells reduced sensitivity to azenosertib. In vivo, higher levels of baseline expression of Cyclin E1 in tumor cells were associated with better response to azenosertib, with tumor growth inhibition (TGI) ranging from 51.5% in a Cyclin E1low SKOV3 model to 88% in a Cyclin E1high OVCAR3 model. Azenosertib synergized with chemotherapy agents in multiple ovarian cancer models. In vitro, we report that Cyclin E1high cancer cells were more sensitive to the combination of azenosertib and chemotherapeutics than Cyclin E1low cancer cells. In vivo, the synergy between azenosertib and paclitaxel was stronger in Cyclin E1high OVCAR3 model (46% reduction of initial tumor volume\/104% TGI) than Cyclin E1low A2780 model (85% TGI). Taken together, these data suggest that Cyclin E1 overexpression via gene amplification or independent mechanisms sensitize ovarian cancer cells to azenosertib alone or in combination with chemotherapy. This observation supports the use of Cyclin E1 expression to enrich for azenosertib responders in ovarian cancer and possibly other tumor types. Two subsets of Cyclin E1-driven platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients, as defined by gene amplification or protein overexpression, are being enrolled in an azenosertib monotherapy trial.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cyclin E,WEE1,Ovarian cancer,ZN-c3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jianhui Ma<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Wen Liu<sup><\/sup>, Heekyung Chung<sup><\/sup>, Hooman Izadi<sup><\/sup>, Petrus DeJong<sup><\/sup>, Olivier Harismendy<sup><\/sup>, Jiali Li<sup><\/sup>, Fernando Doñate<sup><\/sup>, Ahmed Samatar<sup><\/sup>, Mark Lackner<sup><\/sup>, Laure Escoubet<sup><\/sup>, Kevin Bunker<sup><\/sup>, Daehwan Kim<sup><\/sup>, Nathan Jameson<sup><\/sup>, Tugba Yildiran Ozmen<sup><\/sup>, Kangjin Jeong<sup><\/sup>, Dong Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Wen-An Pan<sup><\/sup>, Gordon Mills<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Zentalis Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7593195e-fdb8-47a2-8946-5054ff32990c","ControlNumber":"7375","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

Despite therapeutic advances, it remains the second leading cause of female cancer mortality. Aggressive breast cancers are represented as a clinical (inflammatory BC or locally advanced BC) or as a biopathological form (triple negative BC or HER2+ BC). These aggressive forms have a poor prognosis. In the US, African Americans have a 41% higher BC death rate than Caucasians women. As observed in the US, in African Gabon women, a more aggressive and cases of triple negative BC are found. Aggressive BC are mainly associated with African women. At this stage, chemotherapy is the main therapeutic treatment but chemoresistance is the major hurdle. One solution to chemoresistance would be to found candidates biomarkers that predict therapeutic responses. The goal of our study was to establish an RNA signature that could differentiate chemosensitive from chemoresistant patients in BC African women.<br \/>Methods: RNA sequencing technique was used to establish expression profiling in African women before and after chemotherapy using three groups of aggressive BC patients treated with: Doxorubicin, 5-Fluorouracil or Navelbine. We first isolated RNA from tissues fixed in paraffin and sequenced it via the Nextseq 2000 system. A tximport (v1.20.0) and DESeq2 (v1.26.0) analysis then identified significantly and differentially expressed transcripts between the different groups.<br \/>Results: In the doxorubicin group, post-chemotherapy patients had 962 significant genes out of the 46461 transcripts compared to pre-chemotherapy patients. The post-chemotherapy 5-FluoroUracil group had 3723 significant genes out of 43821 transcripts compared to pre-chemotherapy Fluorouracil group and the post-chemotherapy Navelbine group had 980 significant genes out of 44689 transcripts compared to pre-chemotherapy Navelbine group. Relevant overexpressed genes were selected for validation by immunohistochemistry<br \/>(IHC). We found an enrichment in the KEGG and PI-3K\/Akt pathways and observed that Akt downstream substrates were express differently between pre- and post-chemotherapy patients.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study suggests that some of the overexpressed post chemotherapy genes could serve as biomarkers of aggressive BC. This is the first study in Canada to investigate Doxorubicin, Flurouracile and Navelbine chemoresistance-related genes in African women and could lead to the discovery of diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sequencing,breast Cancer,Biomarkers,African,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hurette Junie Chansi Kengni<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Eric Asselin<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Québec at Trois-Rivières, Trois-Rivières, QC, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"148eed19-66e2-44e6-9c27-85c805341e79","ControlNumber":"2124","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

When administered in preclinical models, a unique &#8216;T-cell remodeling&#8217; MoA characterized by robust increase of CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T<sub>eff <\/sub>\/CD4<sup>+<\/sup>T<sub>reg <\/sub>coupled with potent NK-cell activation\/expansion was observed. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can be used as a non-invasive biomarker of early clinical response whilst overcoming challenges of obtaining repeat tumor biopsies from patients. Previously, we reported results of the Phase 1 HAMMER study (NCT04009681); herein, we describe an innovative integrative approach that considers peripheral key MoA biomarkers with objective response and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate to help identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for SAR&#8217;245.<br \/>Methods: SAR&#8217;245 was given IV as mono Q3W [Cohort B] or Q3W + IV pembro 200 mg Q3W\/400 mg Q6W [Cohort C]. Joint modeling was carried out to account for the relationship between dose and 1) MoA biomarkers, and NK cells in blood measured by flow cytometry;<sub> <\/sub>2) response surrogate biomarker: ctDNA measured by Guardant Omni 500 panel; and 3) DLTs. In the model, a latent variable was used to model correlation between DLT and the MoA or response surrogate biomarkers, Bayesian approach was used to derive posterior probabilities (PP) at each dose level of the target region (defined by &#62;20% probability of fold change of biomarker values post-treatment above a predefined threshold and DLT rate &#60;33%) and the PP of the overdose region (defined by DLT rate &#8805;33%). RP2D dose level was determined by maximizing the PP of target region among doses with PP of the overdose region probability &#60;40%.<br \/>Results: Samples from 35 subjects (Cohort B) and 34 subjects (Cohort C) were available. The results from SAR&#8217;245 mono suggests that the CD8\/CD4 ratio and the concentrations of NK, CD8, and CD4 achieve maximum probability of reaching meaningful modulation (based on pre-defined threshold) around 32 ug\/kg. When SAR&#8217;245 was combined with pembro, the results with PoM biomarkers showed the best performance at 24-32 &#181;g\/kg, while results with ctDNA showed the best results at 16-24 &#181;g\/kg. When all parameters were considered, either 24 or 32 &#181;g\/kg could serve as an adequate dose at Q3W scheduling.<br \/>Conclusions: In early oncology studies, joint modeling using non-invasive biomarkers, including MoA and response biomarkers, and a safety profile can inform dose-response relationships and support RP2D selection. This innovative integrative modeling will guide clinical study design.
