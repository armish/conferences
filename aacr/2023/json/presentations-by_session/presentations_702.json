[{"Abstract":"Retinoblastoma is a cancer of the infant retina primarily driven by the loss of the Rb tumor suppressor gene, which is undruggable. Here, we identified an autocrine signaling, mediated by secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2), which suppresses nitric oxide and enables retinoblastoma growth. SFRP2 silencing resulted in rapid production of nitric oxide, leading to p53-dependent growth arrest of retinoblastoma cells. We show that coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CXADR) is the cell surface receptor for SFRP2 in retinoblastoma cells, that CXADR functions as a \"dependence receptor,\" transmitting a growth inhibitory signal in the absence of SFRP2, and that the balance between SFRP2 and CXADR determines nitric oxide production. Accordingly, high SFRP2 RNA expression correlates with high-risk histopathologic features in retinoblastoma. Targeting SFRP2 signaling by SFRP2-binding peptides or by a pharmacological inhibitor rapidly induced nitric oxide and profoundly inhibited retinoblastoma growth in orthotopic xenograft models. These results reveal a cytokine signaling pathway that regulates nitric oxide production and retinoblastoma cell proliferation, and is amenable to therapeutic intervention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-01 Developmental origins and drivers of pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nitric oxide,Signaling pathways,Proteomics,Retinoblastoma protein,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Panneerselvam Jayabal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiuye Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kathryn M.

To confirm that Notch1 drives expression of CCR7, we modified the ROSA26-PRDM14 ([PRDI-BF1 (positive regulatory domain I-binding factor 1) and RIZ (retinoblastoma interacting zinc finger) homology domain containing 14]) MX-1 Cre inducible CD8+ T-ALL mouse model. This model, upon induction with polyI:C, expresses NOTCH1 downstream of PRDM14, and the T-ALL cells enter the CNS during leukemogenesis. We crossed these mice with ROSA26-Luc2 mice, which allows for tracking of T-ALL cells during disease progression. We questioned if these T-ALL cells expressed CCR7. We found that not only do the T-ALL cells express CCR7 and enter the CNS, but that a CCR7 antagonist, CCL19<sub>8-83<\/sub> administered during leukemogenesis doubles the mean survival of the CCL19<sub>8-83<\/sub> treated mice from 45 to 90 days.

Cancer stem cells are the root of cancer recurrence and metastasis. By using the microRNAome analysis of Taiwan OSCC cohort, we found miR-876-3p was highly correlated to OSCC recurrence. The precursor miR-876 promoted <i>in vitro<\/i> OSCC cell proliferation, migration, and cancer stemness and regulated several cancer stemness-relative genes such as NANOG, OCT4, and LIN28A expression. miR-876 and miR-873 are located in the second intron of the 5&#8217;-untransalation region (5&#8217;-UTR) at the alternative variant leucine-rich repeat and Ig domain containing 2 (LINGO2). Interestingly, only OSCC cells presented LINGO2 protein expression but did not show in primary oral keratinocytes (HOK). The unique CpG islands at the alternative transcription start site of LINGO2 hinted at crucial epigenetic regulation that controls LINGO2 activation. Silencing of LINGO2 expression reduced OSCC cell growth and cancer stemness abilities. LINGO2 expression was higher in OSCC tumor tissue than in adjacent normal tissue in both Taiwan and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) head and neck cancer cohorts. Moreover, LINGO2 also served as a poor prognostic marker in cancer patients' overall and recurrent free survival time. In summary, we found a novel LINGO2-microRNA cluster that regulates OSCC stemness and metastasis abilities. Those cancer specific expressions may provide a new therapy niche in OSCC cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB08-02 Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oral cancers,Stemness,Recurrence,MicroRNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wei-Min Chang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li-Jie Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Che-Hsuan Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Hsiao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Mu-Hsin Chang<\/i><\/presenter>.

Studies based on single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics have classified GBM cells into distinct transcriptional phenotypes. However, how the transcriptional diversity and spatial cellular organization are associated with patient prognosis remains incompletely resolved. Here, we developed a deep learning model to predict spatially resolved transcriptional programs from histology images. The model was trained on spatial transcriptomics data and validated in external testing cohorts. Applying the model to two separate patient cohorts led to the discovery of conserved relationships between tumor architecture and prognosis. Patient with poor prognosis had higher proportions of GBM cells expressing a hypoxia-induced transcriptional program. In addition, high clustering patterns of reactive astrocytes were associated with a poor prognosis. Conversely, when the reactive astrocytes were dispersed and connected to other cell types, the risk was decreased. To validate our results, we developed a separate deep learning model that used histology images to predict prognosis. Applying the model to spatial transcriptomics data discovered survival-associated regional gene expression programs. Genes related to glycoprotein metabolism and injury response were significantly upregulated in tumor cells with high aggressiveness. Our studies established a scalable approach to resolve the transcriptional heterogeneity of GBM and linked the spatial cellular architecture to clinical outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-04 Methods to measure tumor evolution and heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor heterogeneity,Machine learning,Transcription,Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yuanning Zheng<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Francisco Carrillo-Perez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marija Pizurica<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olivier Gevaert<\/i><\/presenter>.

MDK expression is gradually increased during carcinogenesis, acting as a mediator for the acquisition of cancer hallmarks, such as invasion\/metastasis, and immunosuppression. Tissue-wide gene expression analysis using publicly available databases reveal that MDK is significantly upregulated in most human carcinomas. In the thyroid, MDK has been associated with increased metastatic potential in the context of papillary thyroid cancer, which is an otherwise relatively non-aggressive thyroid tumor. We thus theorized that more aggressive types of thyroid cancers may be linked to increased MDK expression\/function from an earlier onset. To gain such insights, we developed a digital pathology infrastructure to investigate MDK expression in a characterized mouse model of Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma (ATC), the most aggressive and lethal type of thyroid cancer with low but increased prevalence in the human population, and an intrinsic resistance to available therapeutic options. Mice with conditional ablation of tumor suppressors, Pten and p53, in thyrocytes [Pten, p53]<sup>thyr-\/-<\/sup> develop thyroid carcinomas with mixed follicular and anaplastic components, and histological hallmarks of high aggressiveness, including giant cells, bone metaplasia, and muscular\/tracheal invasion, which are all recapitulated in human disease. MDK was more highly expressed in anaplastic, when compared to follicular components of the same animal tumors. When the above hallmarks were topographically and microanatomically demarcated within the anaplastic component, it was found that MDK expression was higher near and around giant cell islets, as well as within the anaplastic lesions invading beyond the cartilaginous rings of tracheal mucosal epithelium. Based on recent evidence that MDK does not solely function in the extracellular space, but can also be endocytosed within tumor cells, whereby it exerts tumor-promoting functions, we further quantified the intra\/extranuclear MDK fraction using intensity thresholding immunofluorescence. Of interest, MDK<sup>+<\/sup> follicular lesions, were primarily characterized by nuclear MDK expression, whereas MDK<sup> <\/sup>was mostly found secreted in the extracellular space of anaplastic lesions, thus implying different modes of MDK trafficking, secretion, and possibly function in them. The take home message is to work towards establishing and developing gain- and loss-of-function experiments, to elucidate mechanistic underpinnings on the role of MDK in the development of aggressive ATC lesions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-01 Chemokines in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Thyroid cancer,Chemokines,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dimitra P.

Although senescent cells remain metabolically active, little is known about their metabolic landscape and <i>in vivo<\/i> pathophysiological implications. Here we show that expression of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) inhibitory enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), is significantly upregulated in human senescent stromal cells. Preferentially expressed upon genotoxicity-induced senescence, PDK4 is negatively correlated with posttreatment survival of cancer patients. Upon cellular senescence, PDK4 shifts glucose metabolic flux from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to aerobic glycolysis, causing enhanced lactate production and forming an acidic microenvironment. However, distinct from the cancer cell-featured &#8216;Warburg effect&#8217;, senescent cells maintain an intensive use of pyruvate through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), displaying increased respiration and redox activity, indicative of a special form of metabolic reprogramming. Conditioned media from PDK4<sup>+<\/sup> stromal cells change global expression and promote malignancy of recipient cancer cells<i> in vitro<\/i> and accelerate tumor progression <i>in vivo<\/i>. Nevertheless, specific targeting PDK4 curtails the adverse effects of senescent cells in cell-based assays, while promoting tumor regression and extending posttreatment survival in preclinical trials. Of note, increased levels of lactate in circulating blood after chemotherapy predicts lower survival in cancer clinics. PDK4 upregulation and ensuing lactate production are thus among key features of senescence, in addition to the established cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous hallmarks of senescent cells, providing a novel therapeutic target for future clinical oncology. Together, our study substantiates the hypercatabolic capacity of senescent cells, and reveals a metabolic link between senescence-associated acidic microenvironment and age-related pathologies, including but not limited to cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Senescence,Metabolism,Resistance,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Xuefeng Dou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Judith Campisi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Yu Sun<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

This idea of reversal has been used to mine databases of cell-line transcriptional responses against drug libraries to prioritize anti-cancer drugs. However, there are two key shortcomings in these approaches: (1) though cytokines and their receptors are proposed as modulators of therapy response, there is no reversal-based method to prioritize cytokines as potential drugs or targets, and (2) responses of microenvironmental cell types to drugs, which dictate therapy response, have not been considered. We address these limitations by exploiting recent databases of cytokine transcriptional response and single-cell RNA-seq datasets of patient responses to cancer therapies. We first used a novel approach to derive drug response signatures from LINCS data that retained the coordinated nature of gene expression changes occurring during treatment. We then used these signatures to compute a transcriptional reversal score that ranks drugs by their ability to reverse TCGA RNA-seq profiles of a tumor towards its corresponding normal in GTEx. We found that FDA-approved drugs in prostate, lung, colorectal and breast adenocarcinomas have a significantly higher reversal potential than unapproved drugs, and that these drugs are more effective at in vitro cell killing amongst CTRP and GDSC cell viability measurements. Next, we extended our signature derivation and reversal computation approach to find cytokines in the CytoSig database that can reverse TCGA RNA-seq profiles. We found that the higher the reversal potential of a cytokine, the greater its association with better overall patient survival. In particular, our approach revealed the IL10 family and IL24 as potentially therapeutic cytokines based on their predicted ability to reverse cell states across tumor types and indeed found them to be associated with better overall and progression-free survival in the TCGA cohort. Finally, in two clinical cohorts where RNA-seq was carried out on breast cancer and multiple myeloma patients before and after therapy, cell types within the tumor microenvironment of responders showed a stronger reversal towards a healthy state compared to non-responders.Altogether, our work establishes the importance of transcriptional reversal in therapy response, particularly the role of microenvironmental transcriptional alterations. This allows us to refine the reversal principle based on pan-cell type transcriptional effects and to identify cytokines that mediate patient survival as a new class of drugs and drug targets.<br \/><i>This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the NIH, <\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Chemotherapy response,Tumor microenvironment,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Vishaka Gopalan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sridhar Hannenhalli<\/i><\/presenter>.

The TME contains a mesh of fibrous proteins such as collagen fibers, elastin, and fibronectin, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) that fill the interstitial space. As tumor cells migrate and invade throughout the extracellular matrix (ECM), they can communicate with each other mechanically by utilizing biophysical cues such as contractile forces and fiber alignment. For example, leader cells emerging from tumor spheroids can align ECM fibers to guide follower cells. In breast cancer, hyaluronic acid (HA), one of the GAGs found in the tumor stroma, is often overexpressed in pathological tissues, and stromal HA has been correlated with poor survival. Mechanically, while cells can guide their way by aligning matrix fibers through traction force generation, it is reported that HA may impact force transmission by altering matrix microstructure in the TME. It is therefore crucial to understand how HA impacts the interaction between tumor cells and the TME.<br \/>In this study, we first investigated the bulk mechanical properties and micro-architecture of collagen-HA hydrogels (Col-HA). Our rheology measurements show that HA softens the collagen network while increasing the onset strain for strain-stiffening. Structurally, together with smaller pore sizes and thinner fibers as revealed by reflectance confocal microscopy, fiber alignment in Col-HA becomes less favorable. We then questioned how MDA-MB-231 cells generate traction forces in Col-HA using 3-dimensional traction force microscopy (3D TFM). Along with less fiber alignment around cells in Col-HA, we found that force transmission distance is reduced in Col-HA, as revealed by a shorter propagation of matrix deformation. In Col-HA, while the matrix resists alignment as the fiber network becomes more isotropic, we hypothesized that force transmission is also adhesion-dependent. Specifically, we investigated the role of &#946;1-integrin and CD44, the key adhesion molecules to collagen fiber and HA respectively, in traction force generation. Immunofluorescence staining shows a significant increase in colocalization between actin and the two adhesion molecules in Col-HA, compared to pure collagen matrix. Interestingly, CD44 is colocalized with &#946;1-integrin in Col-HA, but not in pure collagen. While it is widely recognized that cells transmit forces via &#946;1-integrin in collagen matrices, we suspect that, in parallel with &#946;1-integrin, CD44 may also be involved in traction force transmission because of its linkage between actin and HA. To examine how &#946;1-integrin and CD44 contribute to force transmission in Col-HA, we neutralized them with antibodies and performed 3D TFM experiments. Preliminary data shows that matrix deformation decreases significantly when either &#946;1-integrin and CD44 is blocked. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that HA reduces the mechanical communication between breast tumor cells by reducing force transmission distance. And in addition to &#946;1-integrin, CD44 may also be required in traction force transmission in Col-HA. In the future, we will explore the differential role of &#946;1-integrin and CD44 on tumor invasion in the presence of HA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-03 Extracellular matrix and integrins,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD44,Hyaluronan,Integrins,Cell traction force,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Brian C.H.

It is mainly produced by macrophages and can bind to its receptor (IL12R) on T cells. It affects several aspects of T cell activation, including IFN-&#947; and perforin production. Tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells perform important anti-tumoral actions, which need to be overcome to allow cancer cell growth. This work studied IL-12 administration as an HCC preventive strategy in cirrhotic mice. We investigated whether IL-12 can boost the recruitment of macrophages to the liver, increase their antigen-presenting ability, and activate cytolytic T cells to inhibit HCC development in cirrhotic livers.<br \/><b>Method:<\/b> 8 weeks old mice were fed a choline-deficient High fat diet (CDAHFD) for 16 weeks to create NAFLD-induced HCC. A subset of CDAHFD mice was injected intravenously with IL-12 (0.5mg\/gr) weekly from 12 to 16 weeks. Mice were euthanized after 16 weeks, and liver and serum were collected for further analysis.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> After tissue collection, we observed that 50% of untreated animals developed HCC lesions, while IL-12-treated mice did not have any HCC. After treatment with IL12, qPCR and western blot on total liver tissue showed up-regulation in the IL12 receptor and activation of the IL-12 pathway, evidenced by the increase in Stat4 expression and phosphorylation. Additionally, we detected an increase in IFN-&#947; expression by qPCR in IL-12-treated mice. Histological analysis showed a significant decrease in fat and collagen deposition in IL-12-treated livers compared to untreated livers. IL-12-treated mice had lower serum aminotransferase enzymes (AST &#38; ALT), indicating improved liver function. Immunostaining and flow cytometry of F4\/80 (macrophage marker) showed an increase in the number of macrophages in the livers treated with IL-12. Flow cytometry data showed that the majority of macrophages present in the IL-12 livers were CCR2<sup>+<\/sup>, a marker for recruited macrophages. Notably, IL-12-treated macrophages expressed more MHCII (antigen presentation marker) and less B7H4 (inhibitory marker). In addition, we observed a significant increase in the number of cytolytic T cells (CD8<sup>+<\/sup>) in the IL-12 treated livers, which had higher expression of the T cell activation marker (CD25) and elevated levels of perforin and IFN-&#947; that are nessacery for their cytotoxic activity.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> There is a lack of substantial evidence to describe the underlying mechanisms supporting the idea of cirrhosis regression and HCC prevention. Our study shows that the exogenous administration of IL-12 causes an increase in migrating profibrolysis macrophages to the liver and elevates cytolytic T-cell activity. IL-12 immunotherapy can trigger cirrhosis regression and prevent HCC development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Liver,Macrophages,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mozhdeh Sojoodi<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen C.

This is in large because majority of cases are diagnosed at advanced stage and frequently recur after primary treatment. Despite numerous efforts to develop effective targeted therapies and immunotherapies for ovarian cancer the standard of care remains chemotherapies. We postulate that part of the problem is the paucity of preclinical research and clinical trials focused on dormant persister ovarian cancer cells that remain after chemotherapy treatments. Emerging evidence supports the idea that persister cancer cells undergo a period of dormancy following chemotherapy which enables their survival and drive late recurrence. Thus, there is dire need to understand the pathways that empower the establishment of dormancy following chemotherapies in ovarian cancer. Epigenetic reprogramming is notoriously known to enable cell fate transitions and the establishment of drug resistance. An important layer of epigenetic regulation frequently overlooked in cancer is the regulation of nucleosome composition via histone variants. Importantly, analysis of data from the human protein atlas revealed that histone H3.3 chaperone, Histone Regulator Protein A (HIRA) expression inversely correlated with poor prognosis, suggesting that HIRA suppression might play a role in the development of chemotherapy resistance. Here, we demonstrate that HIRA is a major regulator of cell fate transitions in ovarian cancer cells in response to chemotherapies. Our data indicates that HIRA levels are suppressed in response chemotherapies in cancer cells. Genetic suppression of HIRA in ovarian cancer cells triggered a non-poliferative state characterized by the induction of canonical dormancy markers (p27, an increase in p38 phosphorylation) and cell cycle arrest. Accordingly, HIRA suppression in these cancer cells renders them less sensitive to the standard of care chemotherapy agent paclitaxel. Together, our data demonstrates that HIRA levels play an important role in controlling cell fate decisions in ovarian cancer and regulate chemotherapy sensitivity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-10 Tumor dormancy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Dormancy,Chemoresistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maya Yasukawa<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stanislav Drapela<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Didem Ilter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mian M.

TME mainly comprises fibroblasts, immune cells, pericytes, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and the tumor-specific extracellular matrix (ECM). Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are active stromal cells in the TME, acting as signaling and remodeling centers and aiding the creation of desmoplastic tumor stroma. To better understand the identities of CAF subtypes promoting tumor or abnormal activation, it is essential to find a master transcription factor (TF) that determines the identity of cancer-associated fibroblast subtypes. RUNX2 is known as a transcription factor and is rarely expressed in normal tissues; however, it is expressed in abnormally activated fibroblastic regions. In this study, we hypothesized that a master transcription factor of RUNX2 determines the phenotype of normal fibroblasts to CAF and defines its super-enhancer landscape. To identify CAF-specific and functionally important TFs, we analyzed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) from various cancer patients, focusing on CAFs. Specifically, H3K27ac and RUNX2 ChIP-seq were performed on CAFs to confirm their super-enhancer profiles. To examine the biological significance of RUNX2, we established cancer-associated fibroblasts from patients with colorectal cancer and loss of RUNX2 using shRNA-mediated methods. Here, we assessed the effect of indirect cancer cell and CAF interaction models (conditioned media) in addition to direct methods (co-culture) using a 3D spheroid. To determine the significance of RUNX2 in established CAFs and cancer cells in vivo, HCT116 colorectal cancer cells were co-grafted with RUNX2 knockdown CAFs into NOD\/SCID mice. Using a combination of a direct CAF-HCT116 3D spheroid model and HCT116 cells with CAF-conditioned media, we confirmed that knockdown of RUNX2 in CAFs suppressed the migration or invasion of cancer cells and inhibited the sphere-forming ability of cancer cells by RUNX2-depleted CAFs. Knockdown of RUNX2 CAFs also failed to aggregate spherical 3D phenotypes in the direct model. Interestingly, based on the ChIP-seq analysis of CAFs with H3K27ac and RUNX2, we confirmed that RUNX2 can remodel the super-enhancer landscape in CAFs and that the gene associated with RUNX2 was enriched in myofibroblastic signatures. Using a gel contraction assay, we showed that fibroblast contractility was significantly decreased by RUNX2 knockdown. To evaluate the importance of tumor formation in vivo, we transplanted RUNX2-knockdown CAFs with cancer cells and found that the tumor burden was lower depending on RUNX2 dysfunction. We further analyzed the correlation between the expression of RUNX2 and clinical outcomes and confirmed that RUNX2 is highly expressed in CAFs and strongly correlates with poor survival across several cancer types. Our findings indicate that RUNX2 is a promising target for myofibroblastic function and pro-tumorigenic features of the cancer microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Tumor biology,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>So-Young Yeo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Keun-Woo Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Insuk Sohn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seok-Hyung Kim<\/i><\/presenter>.

This study investigates the inhibitory effect of ARC2-001 on cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs promote cancer progression and directly stimulate cancer cell proliferation. In addition, CAFs act as therapeutic barriers to prevent the penetration of anticancer drugs and immune cells in the treatment of solid tumors such as colorectal cancer. In our previous study, we found a master transcription factor PRRX1 of stromal fibroblasts for myofibroblastic lineage progression in the cancer microenvironment. After deleting the expression of PRRX1 in various CAFs using the CRISPR-CAS9-sgRNA system, we confirmed changes in gene expression patterns and performed in silico screening to derive drugs showing similar gene expression patterns. These drugs were investigated through a gel contraction assay and indirect co-culture \/ direct 3D spheroid co-culture systems using various cancer cells and CAFs. Among them, ARC2-001 treatment not only significantly reduced the ECM remodeling ability of CAFs but also showed strong anticancer effects in the co-culture systems. In addition, the response to ARC2-001 was much more sensitive in CAFs than in cancer cells: the IC50 values in cancer cells were30-50nM, and the IC50 values in CAFs were 10-20nM. We produced HCT116 (colon cancer cell)-Colon CAFs spheroids, treated them with ARC2-001at low concentrations that could only affect CAFs, and analyzed RNA transcriptome changes by RNA-SEQ. We confirmed that HCT116 cells underwent EMT as well as observed an increase in the cancer stem cell (CSC) population by CAFs through co-culture of HCT116-CAFs spheroids. Interestingly, treatment with a concentration of ARC2-001 sufficient to inhibit only CAFs had no significant effect on HCT116-only spheroids, and little change occurred in gene expression patterns, but in HCT116 cells in spheroid co-culture with CAFs, the aforementioned changes (EMT and CSC population increase) all collapsed. This indicates that ARC2-001 interferes with the interactions between cancer cells and CAFs. ARC2-001 damages the cancer stem cell population of HCT116 through CAFs inhibition, indicating that the CSC subpopulation of HCT116 cells is dependent on CAFs. We further hypothesized that co-administration of ARC2-001 and commonly used anticancer drugs could be a very effective strategy, considering the ineffectiveness of commonly used anticancer drugs on the CSC subpopulation. Thus, we transplanted colon CAFs together with HCT116 cells into NOD\/SCID mice and then administered 5FU, an existing anticancer drug, together with ARC2-001. For the combined treatment in the in vivo experiment, we treated ARC2-001 and 5FU at half of the commonly used concentrations.

This indicates that ARC2-001 dramatically increases the effectiveness of existing anticancer drugs and can be used as an additional combination therapy for colorectal cancer chemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Cancer therapy,CAF targeted Drug,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Keun-Woo Lee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>So-Young Yeo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>InSuk Sohn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Seok-Hyung Kim<\/i><\/presenter>.

Upon malignant transformation, CLDN1 is overxpressed and epitopes become exposed outside the tight junctions (non-Junctional CLDN1). ALE.C04 is a highly specific humanized monoclonal antibody that recognizes a unique CLDN1 exposed epitope in different solid tumors. Herein we show that non-Junctional CLDN1 (NJ-CLDN1) is frequently overexpressed in solid tumors. Pre-clinically, ALE.C04 drives tumor growth inhibition in different CDXs and PDX <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor models. Notably, CLDN1 expression on tumor cells positively correlates with T cell exclusion, a mechanism described to hinder the efficacy of Checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs). On this line, the overexpression of Cldn1 in mouse tumor cells promoted T-cell exclusion and resistance to anti-PD1 treatment. Importantly, ALE.C04 restored both T-cell infiltration and anti-PD1 efficacy in tumors. Mechanistically, NJ-CLDN1 interacts with different components involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, thus establishing a physical barrier that exclude immune cells from the tumor nest. ALE.C04 perturbs the interface between CLDN1+ tumor cells and the stroma, thus restoring immune cell infiltration. Our pre-clinical data showed that: i) NJ-CLDN1 is a novel and druggable target in solid tumors ii) ALE.C04 is a selective anti-CLDN1 antibody capable of driving anti-tumor activity as both single agent and in combination with anti-PD1.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Tumor microenvironment,T cell,Checkpoint Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alberto Toso<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Geoffrey Teixeira<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tina Zimmermann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stefanie Gill Gill<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniela Schmitter<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Markus Meyer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marion Muller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laurent Mailly<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Baumert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luigi Manenti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roberto Iacone<\/i><\/presenter>.

Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare adrenal cancer that has high mortality due to high rate of metastasis. The therapeutic options of metastatic-ACC include surgery and combination of chemotherapeutic regimens, but with very poor outcomes. The heterogeneous composition of immune and stromal cells in the metastatic microenvironment (MME) and adjacent primed tissues, and their crosstalk with malignant cells are critical determinants of cancer metastatic progression and response to therapies, which remain poorly understood for ACC. Therefore, to comprehensively characterize ACC-MME and adjacent primed tissues, and to identify global and tissue-specific reprogramming, we performed single cell RNA sequencing of metastatic-ACC and adjacent primed tissues from the liver and lung. Our studies revealed that ACC-MME undergoes aberrant vascularization with global depletion of capillary endothelial cells (ECs) and enrichment for Tip\/ Stalk-like ECs, which are significantly associated with poor disease outcome. Moreover, ECs in ACC-MME are highly pro-tumorigenic, showing global upregulation of tumor-promoting gene signatures, and key signaling pathways responsible for angiogenesis, proliferation, migration, and immune suppression, as well depletion of effective anti-tumor immune response programs such as antigen presentation and interferon gamma signaling. Furthermore, there is a major shift in tissue-specific and universal myeloid populations in ACC-MME and adjacent primed tissues, exhibiting global enrichment of dysfunctional DCs and immunosuppressive macrophages, and liver specific pDCs in MME, whereas, MDSCs are broadly enriched in both MME and adjacent primed tissues suggesting these primed for metastasis environments are immune suppressive. CD8 T-cells in ACC-MME express a dysfunctional gene signature, showing downregulation of key effector function genes. We also found an enrichment of immunosuppressive CD4-T-regs in ACC-MME that represent dysregulation of immune checkpoint molecules including CTLA4 and LAG3. Finally, immune and stroma cell populations in ACC MME and adjacent primed tissues show a commonality in reprogramming, favorable for tumor growth and metastasis, across diverse cell and tissue types in comparison to normal tissue samples. Taken together, these findings suggest that ACC-MME and its adjacent primed tissue microenvironments are reprogrammed to immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting states that orchestrate metastasis of ACC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microenvironment,Extracellular matrix ,Tumor heterogeneity,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mohd Omar Faruk Sikder<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vishaka D.
