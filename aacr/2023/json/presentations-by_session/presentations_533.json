Breast and prostate cancer arise from aberrant estrogen\/estrogen receptor (ER) and testosterone\/androgen receptor signaling (AR), respectively. These sex hormone receptors are members of the steroid hormone receptor family, which also includes the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and progesterone receptor (PR). Although these receptors canonically function through homodimerization, recent evidence has suggested that receptor crosstalk can amplify or dampen the actions of heterologous receptors. However, these interactions have not been extensively studied in all possible combinations of steroid hormone receptor crosstalk. In this project, we hypothesize that heterodimerization may amplify or repress the transcriptional response(s) elicited by the various receptor complexes depending upon conditions such as concentration of ligands, type of ligand, physiological states, and the types\/functions of promoter regions. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the significance of ligand-induced interactions between different homo- and heterodimer combinations of AR, ARV7, GR, MR, PR, and ER&#945; in HEK293 cells using IncuCyte live-cell imaging and NanoBRET technology. Ultimately, the combination of transfection experiments, live-cell imaging, and NanoBRET assays provided insight into which combination of steroid receptors successfully interact to amplify (or dampen) the HaloTag expression, luminescence intensity at 450nM (i.e., NanoLuc expression), and NanoBRET ratio (i.e., acceptor emission luminescence at 610nM divided by donor emission luminescence at 450nM) in HEK293 cells. Our studies revealed that heterodimerization of ER&#945;-PR, ER&#945;-MR, AR-GR, AR-PR, ARV7-MR, ARV7-PR, and GR-MR produced significant ligand-induced changes in signaling intensity compared to no ligand conditions for each fusion protein construct. Additionally, to demonstrate the value of the NanoBRET method for modelling clinically relevant disease conditions, we assessed the physical interaction of ER&#945; and PR in the context of the ER&#945; Y537S mutation - a mutation associated with endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer that results in a constitutively active ER&#945;. The results showed that ER&#945;-Y537S mutation increases ER&#945;\/PR physical interaction upon PR-B stimulation in a NanoBRET proximity-based assay. Future directions include testing these interactions in breast and prostate cancer cell lines and identifying the receptors&#8217; localization within the cell, the results of which may be of clinical importance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL03-07 Nuclear receptors: Structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Amira Ishag-Osman<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, David Hosfield<sup>2<\/sup>, Rosemary Huggins<sup>3<\/sup>, Geoffrey Greene<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Evozyne, Chicago, IL,<sup>3<\/sup>Ben May Department for Cancer Research, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4f02e075-df75-4223-bfbc-69e83204099e","ControlNumber":"157","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Mutations in the <i>ESR1<\/i> exclusively occur in the ligand binding domain (LBD) and are significantly enriched following endocrine therapy. These mutations retain the estrogen receptor (ER) expression thus conferring ligand-independent growth, which is a paramount contributor to endocrine therapy resistant disease. Worse progression-free survival is consistently associated with <i>ESR1<\/i> mutation status; therefore, there is an unmet need for therapies against these mutations. To this end, we recently developed TX-245, a bis-benzamide molecule that hampers the function of the two most common <i>ESR1<\/i> mutations - Y537S and D538G.<br \/><b><u>Methods:<\/u><\/b> TX-245 was evaluated <i>in vitro<\/i> using MTT cell proliferation assay and colony formation assay carried out in multiple ER+ breast cancer cells harboring wild type (WT) <i>ESR1<\/i> or mutant (MT) <i>ESR1<\/i>. Approaches such as tumor spheroid cultures were also implemented to study the effect of TX-245 compared to selected SERDs\/SERMs via CellTiter-Glo 3D viability assay. Mechanistic insights were obtained performing TR-FRET assay, fluorescence polarization assay, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, western blot, and qRT-PCR. The therapeutic efficacy <i>in vivo<\/i> was evaluated using cell xenografts, patient derived xenografts (PDX), patient derived explants (PDE), and metastatic mouse models of MT-ER breast cancer.<br \/><b><u>Results:<\/u><\/b> TX-245 demonstrated greater anti-proliferative dose-dependent activity in models harboring WT and MT <i>ESR1<\/i>, including those resistant to fulvestrant and tamoxifen, when compared to other SERDs\/SERMs. RNAseq data suggests that TX-245 dramatically alters the transcription of ER&#945;-regulated genes, with repression of canonical estradiol-upregulated and induction of estradiol-repressed genes. TX-245 was able to antagonize ER-chromatin interaction and ER-transcriptional signaling in breast cancer cells driven by <i>ESR1<\/i> mutation. TX-245 treatment downregulated ER protein expression and decreased expression of ER targeted genes (i.e., GREB and PGR) in multiple ER+ cell lines. TX-245 treatment as a single agent or in combination with palbociclib resulted in tumor regression in xenografts expressing WT, Y537S or D538G ESR1 mutation. PDX and PDE models consistently exhibited substantial tumor growth inhibition as well as decreased proliferation (Ki67 staining). Metastases studies using intracardiac and intratibial injection demonstrated that TX-245 inhibited the progression of established metastatic niches in mice injected with Y537S or D538G ER+ breast cancer cells.<br \/><b><u>Conclusion<\/u><\/b>: Our results indicate that TX-245 inhibits cell proliferation in cell lines that express WT or mutant <i>ESR1<\/i>, induce ER degradation, suppress ER-mediated signaling and reduce tumor burden in mouse models.

We developed a new approach to antagonize the proliferative activity of AR and inhibit castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) growth using multivalent peptoid conjugates (MPCs). Our strategy is to display multiple copies of the AR antagonist, ethisterone, on a peptoid scaffold. Such a multivalent display increases the ligand&#8217;s effective local concentration, thus targeting AR with high affinity and affecting AR interactions with coregulators. Here, we report a new potent MPC called MPC309, which displays three ethisterone groups and binds to AR with nanomolar affinity. MPC309 reduces the proliferation of enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells, including those harboring AR splice variants, AR ligand binding mutations, and non-canonical AR gene expression programs. We provide evidence that MPC309 enters cells via macropinocytosis, which facilitates the fluid-phase uptake of extracellular macromolecules. Macropinocytotic uptake of MPC309 enhances cancer cell-specific delivery, thus limiting systemic toxicities. MPC309 displays favorable pharmacological properties and produced significantly greater tumor suppression in xenograft studies than enzalutamide, the standard of care anti-androgen in clinical use. Mechanistically, MPC309 inhibits prostate cancer growth by eliciting a unique gene expression program through alterations in AR chromatin occupancy compared to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or enzalutamide. Thus, MPC309 represents a novel AR antagonist that activates an AR anti-proliferative program to repress the growth of CRPC and supports further investigation of the MPC compound class for treating CRPC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL03-08 Preclinical studies of endocrine-related cancers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Androgen receptor,Antitumor effect,Transcriptional regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Justine Habault<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jeffrey  A.

As a master regulator of BAs homeostasis and innate immunity, Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR), is severely compromised in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colitis-associated colorectal carcinoma (CAC) patients. At the front line, gut macrophages react to the microbiota and metabolites that breach the epithelium. We aim to study the role of the BAs-FXR axis in macrophages. To dissect how inflammation drives tumorigenesis, we employed a classic mouse model of CAC, profiled BAs and cytokines, monitored tumorigenesis, and examined the function of macrophages and Th17 cells. Moreover, we investigated the potential of FexD, an FXR agonist, in ameliorating intestinal inflammation, thus inhibiting tumorigenesis. Further, we identified how macrophage intrinsic FXR senses the BAs abnormality and reshapes the gut macrophages <i>in vivo <\/i>and<i> ex vivo<\/i>. We also investigated the potential role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in stimulating intestinal stem cells (ISCs)&#8217; stemness using mouse organoids.<b> <\/b>This study demonstrates that inflammation-induced epithelial abnormalities compromised FXR signaling and altered BAs profile in CAC. Gut macrophage intrinsic FXR senses the aberrant BAs, leading to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which promotes ISCs&#8217; proliferation. Notably, FexD reduced intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis by suppressing pro-inflammatory responses in gut macrophages and Th17 cells. Mechanistically, FXR regulates gut macrophages' recruitment, polarization, maturation, and crosstalk with Th17 cells. In summary, we uncovered a novel role of FXR modulation of gut macrophages, highlighting the potential of FXR as a therapeutic target over biologicals for treating colon cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-03 Hormone receptors and diagnosis\/prognosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bile acid,Colorectal cancer,Macrophages,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ting Fu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Xingchen Dong<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f332728b-660c-4477-be00-675d70e4e70a","ControlNumber":"5284","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

These structures often form in response to inflammation and infection during adulthood. However, more recently TLTs have become a focal point of colon caner development and progression as their presence is often associated with positive clinical outcomes. Interestingly, several studies have demonstrated that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) influences the development of secondary lymphoid tissues, but minimal studies have focused on its role in TLT formation. The purpose of the presented studies was to test the <b>hypothesis<\/b> that activation of AhR in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) induces the formation of TLTs in the colon.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Wild type (WT) and IEC-specific AhR knockout (CDX2P<sup>CreT2 <\/sup>x AhR<sup>f\/f<\/sup>- iAhRKO) mice were used in several different experimental models. In the first study, azoxymethane (AOM) was used to induce precancerous lesions in the colon and TLT formation was evaluated in the presence and absence of AhR. Then, experiments were conducted to determine the necessity of AhR expression in IECs to influence the formation of TLTs following induction of acute inflammation induced by Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) exposure. Finally, the ability of known, naturally occurring and microbial-derived AhR ligands (indole-3-aldehyde (I3A), 3,3&#884;-diindolylmethane (DIM), and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)) were tested for their ability to induce TLT formation in the colon.

In the acute inflammation study, sex specific results were found.<b> <\/b>In females, loss of AhR activity in IECs reduced the formation of TLTs without significant changes in immune cell composition within their TLTs. Conversely, in males, loss of AhR lowered expression of functional-IEC genes (<i>Ocln, Il-22<\/i>), increased number of TLTs, increased T-cell density, and lower B: T cell ratio. Finally, in the other experiments, I3A induced TLT formation and DIM promoted intestinal barrier integrity through the upregulation of various tight junction genes and genes involved in the signaling associated with TLT formation. Evaluation of IAA which is a microbial-derived, AhR ligand is ongoing.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> These data indicate that AhR plays a distinct role in the formation of TLTs in the colon and these effects are likely ligand specific and may have a significant effect on colon tumor formation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-09 Receptors and signal transduction,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Receptors,Immune response,Colon cancer,Microbiome,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kimberly  F.

Through inhibition of CYP17A1, Abiraterone (Abi) prevents an upstream step in androgen biosynthesis, while Enzalutamide (ENZ) acts as an AR antagonist. Despite the early success of ARSI, a subset of patients develop resistance and succumb to the disease. One major mode of resistance is thought to occur when steroidogenic enzymes that are upregulated in CRPC convert weaker circulating precursors to testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to restore AR signaling. In this study, we identify a mechanism driving intratumoral steroidogenesis that involves AKR1C3 (type 5 17&#946;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 5). AKR1C3 is a major steroidogenic enzyme in the prostate that is involved in all androgen biosynthetic pathways to T and DHT, upregulated in CRPC patients, and is a component of Abi and ENZ drug resistance. Previously with Taplin et al. we observed in patients on Leuprolide that T was reduced to 5 ng\/dL, and the addition of Abi lowered DHEA-S by 90% (from 230,000 ng\/dL to 22,000 ng\/dL). However, the DHEA-S that remained was 4,000x greater than circulating T, making it a reservoir for intratumoral steroidogenesis post Abi treatment. Here, we demonstrate that post-Abi concentrations of DHEA-S, and castrate levels of DHEA-S (post-leuprolide but pre-Abi treatment), which also corresponds to DHEA-S levels patients on ENZ are 1) converted to T in an AKR1C3-dependent manner in prostate cancer (PCa) cells, and 2) sufficient to stimulate AKR1C3-dependent cell growth. Our observations are consistent across both primary and metastatic PCa cell lines, CWR22PC and DuCaP, respectively. Androgen measurements were made using our highly sensitive and specific stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (SID-LC-MS\/MS) method. Additionally, we demonstrate AKR1C3-dependence using genetic and pharmacological approaches with an AKR1C3 stable knockdown for each cell line and two AKR1C3 competitive inhibitors. Taken together, we have identified a mechanism of resistance to ARSIs common to both primary and metastatic cell lines that operates through AKR1C3&#8217;s intratumoral conversion of DHEA-S to potent androgens that drive prostate cancer growth.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-05 Hormone synthesis, metabolism, and inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Androgen,Resistance,Steroid hormones,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Andrea  J.

We used primary breast cancer biopsies, collected from 198 patients, to assess tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), transcriptomic profiles, and TME composition. Diagnostic biopsy and surgical on-treatment tumor specimens were collected; Ki67, ER&#945;, PR, and HER2 expression were measured using automated quantitative analysis (AQUA). Tumors were categorized as estrogen deprivation-sensitive (ED-S) or -resistant (ED-R) based on the natural log (ln) of the Ki67 score (ln &#8804;1.0 or &#8804;2.7% Ki67+ cells vs. ln &#8805;2.0 or &#8805;7.4%, respectively) in the on-treatment (surgical) biopsy. Scoring of stromal (s)TILs, using hematoxylin and eosin staining of on-treatment specimens, revealed that sTILs were elevated in ED-R compared to ED-S tumors (p&#60;0.0001). We next constructed tissue microarrays (TMAs) of on-treatment tumor sections and performed cyclic immunofluorescence (CyCIF) with 38 antibodies, including markers of hormone receptors, immune cells, signaling pathways, proliferation, DAPI (nuclei), and others. We then segmented single cells from each tumor core and designated them as immune, cancer, or stromal cells based on expression of a set of markers. Briefly, cells that stained strongly for CD45 (leukocyte marker), and\/or CD4 (T lymphocyte marker), or CD68 (macrophage marker) were considered immune cells. CD45\/CD4\/CD68-negative cells were categorized as tumor, if E-cadherin and\/or cytokeratin-positive, or stromal cells, if -negative. To investigate the TME composition, we next assessed cell specific spatial enrichment by quantifying the expression of immune markers in the area immediately adjacent to each tumor cell. Relative to ED-S, ED-R samples exhibited higher CD45+ cells (p&#60;0.0001) and higher CD8+ T cells (p=0.0329), while CD4+ T cells showed no difference. Conversely, immune-suppressive T-reg (CD4+FOXP3+) cells were enriched in the ED-S samples (p=0.0004). In addition, PD1, a marker for T cell exhaustion, was higher in the ED-S group (p=0.0004), as were CD68+ cells (p&#60;0.0001). To confirm and expand upon these findings, RNA-sequencing was performed on the on-treatment tumor sections. Gene set enrichment analysis of hallmark gene signatures revealed that immune-related gene sets, such as &#8220;IFN&#945; response&#8221;, &#8220;IFN&#611; response&#8221;, &#8220;allograft rejection&#8221;, and &#8220;inflammatory response&#8221; were enriched in ED-R vs. ED-S tumors. In summary, our study shows that activated anti-tumor immune cells are enriched in the TME of ER+ breast tumors resistant to estrogen deprivation, whereas ED-sensitive tumors show a more immunosuppressed or immune cold <i>milieu<\/i>. These data suggest a potential causal link between antiestrogen treatment and modulation of antitumor immunity in ER+ breast cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL03-04 Hormone signaling and inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antiestrogens,Tumor microenvironment,Cyclic Immunofluorescence (CyCIF),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Fabiana Napolitano<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Dhivya R.
