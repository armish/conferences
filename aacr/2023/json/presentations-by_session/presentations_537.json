However, the majority of patients develop acquired resistance. PARP inhibitor (PARPi) resistance in tumors can occur by restoration of homologous recombination (HR) or replication fork stability and\/or by suppression of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps at replication forks. USP1 is a ubiquitin specific protease which deubiquitinates PCNA and FANCD2. We have previously shown that USP1 deficiency causes replication fork instability and is synthetic lethal with BRCA1 deficiency, suggesting USP1 as a potential therapeutic target for overcoming PARPi resistance (Lim et al, Mol Cell, 2018). Accordingly, USP1 inhibitors are now undergoing preclinical and clinical development. Here, we evaluated the activity of the novel USP1 inhibitors such as I-138 (Simoneau et al, Mol Cancer Ther, 2022) and TNG-6132 in preclinical models of BRCA1-deficient tumors. I-138 preferentially killed BRCA1-deficient ovarian and breast cancer cells and increased the cellular level of ubiquitinated PCNA. An aniPOND analysis demonstrated an accumulation of ubiquitinated PCNA specifically at the replication fork in I-138-treated cells. Consistent with our previous study (Lim et al, Mol Cell, 2018), I-138 treatment led to replication fork instability and DNA damage in BRCA1-deficient cancer cells. I-138 exposure also resulted in the accumulation of ssDNA gaps, as detected by an S1 nuclease assay. Interestingly, the induction of ssDNA gaps was detected in I-138-sensitive but not in I-138-resistant BRCA1-deficient cells, suggesting a mechanism of cytotoxicity by USP1 inhibition. Persistent monoubiquitinated PCNA accumulation was the cause of cell killing after USP1 inhibition. Knockdown of RAD18, the E3 ubiquitin ligase known to ubiquitinate PCNA, in BRCA1-deficient ovarian cancer cells resulted in reduced PCNA-Ub levels, resistance to I-138, and suppression of ssDNA gaps. Notably, I-138 exhibited monotherapy activity in ovarian and breast cancer cell lines with acquired PARPi resistance and re-sensitized the cells to PARP inhibition. Similarly, PARPi-resistant <i>BRCA1<\/i>-mutated organoids, derived from patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-derived models of ovarian cancer, were also sensitized by USP1 inhibition by TNG-6132. Interestingly, the ssDNA gap accumulation induced by I-138 strongly correlated with the drug sensitivity of both PARPi-sensitive and PARPi-resistant cells. In conclusion, I-138 exhibits monotherapy activity in both PARPi-sensitive and -resistant preclinical models of BRCA1-deficient cancer, induces ssDNA gaps and overcomes PARP inhibitor resistance. Taken together, these data support use of a USP1 inhibitor, with or without a PARP inhibitor, as a therapeutic strategy for a subset of PARP-inhibitor-resistant BRCA1-deficient tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-02 DNA damage response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ubiquitination,DNA repair,Targeted therapy,DNA replication,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alexandre Andre B.

Since proteins are the targets of these therapies and functional effectors of genomic aberrations, proteogenomics data from the Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) provides an unprecedented opportunity to characterize existing and future therapeutic targets for cancer treatment.<br \/>Approach: CPTAC proteogenomics data from &#62;1000 cancer patients spanning 10 cancer types was used to evaluate current and potential therapeutic targets curated from four databases. Cell line data from DepMap was further integrated to distinguish causations from associations. Computational pipelines were deployed to identify synthetic lethality for targeting tumor suppressor loss and to prioritize tumor associated antigens as immunotherapy targets.<br \/>Results: We systematically collected 3050 druggable proteins and classified them into 5 tiers to facilitate different applications such as companion diagnostics, drug repurposing, and new therapy development. Many druggable proteins showed poor mRNA-protein correlation, including secreted proteins and proteins whose abundance was correlated with their interaction partners instead of cognate mRNA, highlighting the necessity of direct proteomic quantification of drug targets. 618 druggable proteins showed both overexpression in tumors compared to normal and significant dependency in CRISPR-Cas9 screens of cell lines of the same lineage. Notably, PAK1, a kinase targeted by investigational drugs, demonstrated both overexpression and dependency in all cancer types. A similar analysis of phosphoproteomics data focusing on known activating sites of druggable proteins further revealed targetable dependencies driven by protein hyperactivation. The phosphosite pS50 on PTPN1, a phosphatase targeted by experimental drugs, was increased in 7 cancer types and PTPN1 demonstrated dependency in related cancer cell lines. Based on tumor proteogenomic data and cell line CRISPR-Cas9 screen data, we identified synthetic lethality for difficult to target tumor suppressor losses, revealing TP53 mutations as a candidate biomarker to select breast cancer patients for CHEK1 inhibition, and endometrial cancer patients for treatment with doxorubicin. We identified 140 proteins whose expression was restricted in normal tissues but abnormal in tumors. Experimental analysis of peptides predicted to have high binding affinity to the most common allotype HLA-A02 for 7 prioritized proteins identified 21 peptides from 5 proteins with both strong binding affinity and immunogenicity which could be further investigated as immunotherapy targets.<br \/>Conclusion: We generate a comprehensive resource of protein and peptide targets that covers multiple therapeutic modalities. This unique resource will pave the way for repurposing of currently available drugs and developing new drugs for cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteomic analysis,Precision medicine,Cancer immunotherapy,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jonathan  T.

We previously developed genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of SCLC using CRISPR\/Cas9 engineered to be <i>NOTCH1<\/i>-Mutant, <i>NOTCH2<\/i>-Mutant, and <i>NOTCH<\/i>-WT. Synthetic lethality provides a paradigm for targeting cancers with LOF mutations in tumor suppressor genes. In applying this paradigm, one looks for specific vulnerabilities that are created upon loss of the gene of interest. Using 6 cell lines developed from these CRISPR-based SCLC GEMMs which are isogenic to <i>NOTCH<\/i>, we performed CRISPR\/Cas9 LOF negative selection screens (using an sgRNA library enriched in druggable enzymes) to identify synthetic lethal interactors with LOF <i>NOTCH<\/i> mutations. Our CRISPR\/Cas9 screen identified TRIM28 (Tripartite Motif Containing 28, or KAP1) as a highly significant synthetic lethal interactor with NOTCH1 or NOTCH2. We validated the synthetic lethal interaction between NOTCH1\/2 and TRIM28 using both human and mouse NOTCH-isogenic cell lines. Interestingly, RNA-sequencing of <i>NOTCH2<\/i>-Mutant or <i>NOTCH<\/i>-WT SCLC cell lines after TRIM28 CRISPR inactivation showed robust increases in endogenous retroviral (ERV) expression and the MDA5\/RIG-I\/MAVS RNA-sensing machinery leading to hyperactivation of the TBK1\/IRF3\/7 innate immune signaling pathway and the pro-inflammatory cytokine CXCL10 selectively in cells with NOTCH inactivated. Notably, inactivation of TBK1 activity or JAK-STAT activity using specific small molecule inhibitors of TBK1 or JAK completely reversed the synthetic lethality between NOTCH and TRIM28 suggesting that the synthetic lethality phenotype is a consequence of hyperactivation of innate immune signaling, which is known to be cytotoxic. Together our findings uncover a novel vulnerability in SCLCs with LOF <i>NOTCH<\/i> mutations and perhaps other cancers with LOF NOTCH mutations and suggest a strategy that could also potentiate anti-tumor immunity by increasing innate immune signaling in tumor cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Notch,Synthetic lethality,Small Cell Lung Cancer,TRIM28,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Deli Hong<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Matthew A.

Clustering extra centrosomes into opposite spindle poles during mitosis is critical for preventing multipolar cell division and apoptosis in cancer cells with CA. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have largely been unexplored. Here, we identified Transforming Acidic Coiled-Coil Containing Protein 3 (TACC3) as a novel CA-directed dependency, driving highly aggressive cell growth by forming distinct functional interactomes during cell cycle progression. We demonstrated, for the first time, that TACC3 interacts with the Kinesin Family Member C1 (KIFC1) via its TACC domain in mitotic cells with CA to promote centrosome clustering (CC) and facilitate mitotic progression. On the other hand, TACC3 interacts with the members of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex (HDAC2 and MBD2) in the nucleus of interphase cells with CA, thereby suppressing the transcription of key tumor suppressors to facilitate G1\/S progression and cell survival. Inhibiting TACC3 in mitotic cells blocks the formation of TACC3\/KIFC1 complex, leading to formation of multipolar spindles and activation of spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC)\/CDK1\/p-Bcl2 axis that ultimately results in mitotic cell death; whereas TACC3 inhibition in interphase cells blocks TACC3\/HDAC2\/MBD2 complex, leading to enhanced transcription of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (e.g., p21 and p16) and apoptosis regulators (e.g., APAF1), ultimately causing p53-independent G1 arrest and strong apoptosis. Notably, inducing CA by chemical (cytochalasin D) or genomic (PLK4 overexpression or p53 loss) modulations renders cancer cells highly sensitive to TACC3 inhibition, showing the dependency of cells with CA to TACC3. Targeting TACC3 by small molecule inhibitors or CrispR-CAS9-mediated knock-out significantly reduces colony formation ability, inhibits the growth of organoids of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) with CA, and strongly inhibits tumor growth in breast cancer cell line xenografts and PDXs with CA via induction of mitotic arrest and inhibition of G1\/S progression. Notably, we demonstrated that high CA tumors express much higher levels of TACC3, and high TACC3 expression leads to drastically worse clinical outcome in cancer patients with CA.

The research of new treatments, which could complement the current therapeutic arsenal constituted by Gemcitabine, FOLFIRINOX (fluorouracile, leucovorin, irinotecan, oxaliplatin) and nab-paclitaxel, is a major challenge. Imiqualines are new original small heterocyclic chemical molecules based on the quinoxalinic moiety. Among these first in class compounds, the lead EAPB02303 (1) displays outstanding nanomolar activities comparable to those of the current best anticancer agents on a panel of human cancer cell lines, notably on poorly sensitive cancer like PDAC and melanoma. We tested here if EAPB02303 could be an attractive first in class molecule in PDAC and we conducted in-deep molecular characterization and bioinformatics studies to decipher its mechanism of action.<br \/>Methods: We characterized EAPB02303 effect on tumor growth <i>in-vitro <\/i>by conducting sulforhodamine B assay on a panel of PDAC cells including cells derived from PDX (Patient Derived Xenograft) and 3D models with Cancer Associated Fibroblasts. We assessed in-vivo activity on subcutaneous PDAC xenografts mouse models. We then studied EAPB02303 effect on cell cycle, apoptosis and microtubule polymerisation by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. We analyzed mRNAseq and Reverse Phase Protein Assay (RPPA) data of PDAC cell lines treated with EAPB02303 at multiple time points and concentrations to identify signaling pathways and key proteins implicated in EAPB02303 effect. We performed differential gene expression and gene set enrichment analysis by using EdgeR, Deseq2 and fgsea packages. We also used PharmacoGx package to seek for similar transcriptomic profiles among the CMAP perturbational database.<br \/>Results : We showed that EAPB02303 exerts activity at low nanomolar concentrations <i>in-vitro<\/i> in PDAC cell lines and 3D models, and is able to reduce tumor growth in our xenografts<i> in-vivo<\/i> mouse models. We also found a potent synergy with Paclitaxel at lower concentrations of both compounds. Furthermore, we found that EAPB02303 induces mitosis arrest and impairment of spindle assembly after 24h treatment. Cells also underwent apoptosis after 48h treatment. mRNAseq and RPPA data showed activation of several signaling pathways including MAPK kinases. CMAP database mining revealed a high connectivity score of transcriptomic signatures between EAPB02303 and inhibitors of microtubule polymerization.<br \/>All these data suggest that EAPB02303 is a new microtubule-disrupting agent with <i>in-vivo<\/i> activity in PDAC and <i>in-vitro<\/i> synergy with Paclitaxel, showing potential for future clinical investigations.<br \/>(1) Imidazo[1,2a]quinoxalines and derivatives thereof for treating cancers.

HCC incidence is rising in parallel with risk factors such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and alcohol induced cirrhosis. A major enzyme in alcohol metabolism, aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) deficiency affects ~560 million people globally. In males, different ALDH2 genotypes exhibit significant metabolic differences from females. Yet the mechanism for the sex differences remains unclear. We have found that targeting an intrinsically disordered protein and TGF-&#946; signaling Smad3\/4 adaptor, &#946;II-spectrin (Sptbn1) blocks NASH and HCC in a liver-specific knockout (LSKO) mice and siRNA to human NASH microfluidic cultures (<i>Sci Transl Med. 2021. 13(624): eabk2267<\/i>). In mouse mutants of Smad3\/Sptbn1 with HCC, stem cell proteins are markedly altered. Here, we sought to examine this further by intercrossing Sptbn1 deficient mice with ALDH2 deficient mice.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Global heterozygous knockout of <i>Sptbn1<\/i> mice were intercrossed with <i>Aldh2<\/i> knockout mice (ASKO) to explore the role of &#946;II-spectrin in aldehyde-related liver injury. LSKO mice were intercrossed with ALDH2 deficient mice (ALSKO) and siRNA treatment to explore the therapeutic effects of targeting <i>Sptbn1 <\/i>during the progression of metabolic syndrome (MetS) or HCC induced by Western diet (WD)\/chemical (DEN) in the context of ALDH2 deficiency in both male and female mice. We performed phenotypic analyses of metabolic state, liver pathology, intestinal pathology, and gut microbiomes.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: LSKO displayed obvious therapeutic effects against liver steatosis in male mice, whereas female mice did not. ASKO mice developed NASH spontaneously and showed impaired glucose handling, disordered lipids metabolism, with increased intestinal permeability and pro-inflammatory species of <i>Bacteroidetes<\/i> and <i>Firmicutes<\/i>. ALDH2 deficiency exacerbated toxic reactive aldehydes accumulation. LSKO mice were protected from WD induced MetS and NASH, including decreased body weight and fat weight, decreased serum triglyceride and AST\/ALT, downregulated expression of proinflammatory genes and profibrotic genes and improved NAS Score. LSKO mice were also protected from WD\/DEN-induced HCC: mice had less tumor number, smaller tumor size and less proliferation. siRNA targeting <i>Sptbn1 <\/i>also showed similar therapeutic effects as LSKO. Further, LSKO and siRNA targeting <i>Sptbn1 <\/i>also improved NASH phenotypes resembling MetS in Aldh2<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice: decreased liver fat accumulation, improved glucose handling and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our data suggest that &#946;II-spectrin, an intrinsically disordered protein, is a potential therapeutic target for diet\/chemical-induced Mets\/NASH and preventing HCC development and could provide new insight into sex-based differences in HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Metabolic syndrome,TGF-&#946;,Target discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xiaochun Yang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Krishanu Bhowmick<sup><\/sup>, Xiyan Xiang<sup><\/sup>, Kazufumi Ohshiro<sup><\/sup>, Anil Vegesna<sup><\/sup>, Lopa Mishra<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Institute for Bioelectronic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Div of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, & Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Northwell Health, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"052c7bf7-c38c-4a88-b606-cfce554f310a","ControlNumber":"7365","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>X.

Even when effective at eradicating primary cancers, DNA-damaging anti-cancer agents cause mutations that can lead to the development of secondary cancers. Furthermore, DNA damage responses are dependent on wild-type p53, which is mutated in over 50% of cancers and causes resistance to therapies. Fortunately, many p53 mutant cancers continue to express high levels of the pro-apoptotic, pore-forming proteins BAX and BAK and are consequently &#8220;primed for apoptosis.&#8221; Primed cells are highly sensitive to pro-apoptotic signals and this vulnerability can be exploited using inhibitors of pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins such as the BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199, which has been successful as therapy for chronic lymphocytic and acute myeloid leukemias (AML). Furthermore, most irreplaceable cells within healthy tissues are apoptosis resistant and express low levels of BAX and BAK. We therefore hypothesized that direct activators of BAX or BAK could be effective single-agent therapies for primed cancers and chemo-\/radio-sensitizers for unprimed cancers. Using WT versus BAX -\/- BAK -\/- HeLa cells, we performed a high-throughput screen of nearly 100,000 compounds to identify small molecules that could directly activate BAX or BAK. 196 compounds were identified as hits and multiple orthogonal validation studies identified Apoptosis Inducing Agent 1 (AIA1) as the most specific and potent putative activator of BAX and BAK. Further validation studies demonstrated that AIA1 directly induces cytochrome c release from mitochondria in a BAX\/BAK dependent manner and strongly enhances BIM-mediated activation of BAX and BAK and permeabilization of liposomes. Single-agent AIA treatment triggers apoptotic cell death in a broad panel of cancer cell lines and also sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents and especially BH3 mimetics targeting pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins. Importantly, AIA1 sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to BCL-X<sub>L<\/sub> inhibitors and AML cells to BCL-2 inhibitors regardless of p53 status. In vivo, AIA1 suppresses tumor growth and prolongs overall survival in both ovarian cancer and AML xenograft models without causing weight loss, thrombocytopenia or leukopenia. Notably, unprimed cancer cells that don&#8217;t immediately undergo apoptosis in response to single-agent AIA1 treatment upregulate expression of BAX and BAK, pro-survival proteins (BCL-X<sub>L,<\/sub> BCL-2, MCL-1) and pro-apoptotic proteins (BIM, BID, PUMA, Noxa) to produce a more highly primed apoptosis pathway and setting the stage for increased sensitivity to BH3 mimetics. Based on these findings, AIA1 may exploit and induce apoptotic vulnerabilities in cancers in a p53-independent manner and represent a safer strategy to target primed cancer cells while eliminating the potential for secondary malignancies and p53-mediated resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-01 Cell death pathways and treatment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bax,Bcl-2 protein family,Apoptosis,BH3 mimetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xingping Qin<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Cameron Fraser<sup>1<\/sup>, Adam Presser<sup>1<\/sup>, Johan KE Spetz<sup>1<\/sup>, Stacey  J.
