[{"Abstract":"Introduction: There is considerable interest in the antineoplastic properties of metformin for prostate cancer treatment, however, the underlying mechanism of action of metformin in this setting is poorly understood. It is suspected that metformin&#8217;s antineoplastic activity is related to inhibition of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), which ultimately inhibits cell proliferation. In this pilot study, we assessed the mTOR activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from high-risk Prostate cancer (PCa) patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) plus metformin versus placebo. We hypothesized decreased mTOR expression in PBMCs from patients receiving metformin versus placebo.<br \/>Methods: Normoglycemic adult males with high-risk PCa receiving ADT &#38; EBRT were randomized to metformin 500 mg 3 times daily or placebo. Peripheral blood samples were collected from participants<br \/>&#8805; 6 months after starting study drug, buffy coats were extracted, and PBMCs were isolated &#8804;2 hours after specimen collection using ficoll-hypaque density gradient method. The mTOR expression was assessed by phosphorylation of serine 2448 (pmTOR; S2448). Activity of mTOR was measured in both unstimulated or stimulated (using CD3\/CD28 antibodies) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.<br \/>Results: Samples from 15 patients were analyzed (11 placebo &#38; 4 metformin). We observed lower expression of pmTOR in PBMCs in patients receiving metformin compared to placebo indicating metformin demonstrated inhibition of mTOR activity in PBMCs. A general trend of mTOR inhibition was observed in the metformin group across the cell population and conditions (unstimulated vs. stimulated T cell populations). However, the most pronounced difference was observed in unstimulated CD4+ cells, which is of interest since they represent the closest physiological state to the study participants.<br \/>Conclusion: In this pilot study, we observed mTOR inhibition in the PBMCs of PCa patients treated with metformin. Further assessment of mTOR activity amongst PCa patients receiving metformin is warranted in order to confirm these findings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Antitumor effect,Metformin,Radiotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Febin Antony<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Anuraag Shrivastav<sup>2<\/sup>, Arbind Dubey<sup>1<\/sup>, Nawaid Usmani<sup>3<\/sup>, Aldrich Ong<sup>1<\/sup>, Rashmi Koul<sup>1<\/sup>, Harvey Quon<sup>4<\/sup>, Gokulan Sivananthan<sup>1<\/sup>, William Hunter<sup>1<\/sup>, Don Yee<sup>5<\/sup>, Lindsay Rowe<sup>5<\/sup>, Brita Danielson<sup>5<\/sup>, Andrew Plesniarski<sup>6<\/sup>, Ruey-Chyi Su<sup>6<\/sup>, Julian  O.

Rapalogs have been used extensively in human clinical trials but exhibit modest clinical benefit for the most part, possibly due to their lack of effect on 4E-BP1, a key target downstream of mTORC1. ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors can fully inhibit mTORC1 but are poorly tolerated possibly due to their inhibition of mTORC2. A new class of selective mTORC1 inhibitors has been developed and termed &#8216;bi-steric&#8217;, which comprise a rapamycin-like core moiety covalently linked to an mTOR active-site inhibitor. We report that bi-steric mTORC1-selective inhibitors (RMC-4627 and RMC-6272) have greater activity than rapalogs for tumors with mTORC1 hyperactivation. RMC-4627 and RMC-6272 showed more effective growth inhibition in multiple tumor cell lines with mTORC1 dysfunction compared to rapamycin. Both RMC-4627 and RMC-6272 at ~1 nM showed near complete inhibition of p4E-BP1<sup>T37\/46<\/sup>, which was not seen with rapamycin treatment. Rapamycin and both bi-steric compounds markedly reduced kidney tumor burden and human bladder cancer PDX tumor size after four weeks of treatment. Tumor regrowth assessed after two-month treatment cessation was significantly reduced in the RMC-6272 group as compared to the rapamycin group. Finally, TUNEL staining showed RMC-6272 treatment led to a greater induction of apoptosis in kidney tumor cells and human bladder cancer PDX tumors relative to rapamycin after a single dose of each compound. This is the first time that clear evidence for cell death after mTORC1 inhibition has been seen. Integrative multi-omic analysis reveals differential global rewiring induced by RMC-6272 in comparison to rapamycin. Genes involved in cell cycle transition were downregulated by RMC-6272 vs. rapamycin. Proteins downregulated by RMC-6272 treatment relative to rapamycin were enriched for translation and ribosome-related proteins, consistent with effects of non-phosphorylated 4E-BP1 on synthesis of those proteins. Multiple purine metabolites were decreased to a greater extent in RMC-6272 treated cells as compared to rapamycin treatment, including deoxyadenosine, AICAR, AMP, IMP, and GMP. Notably, there was no significant change in R5P, suggesting that downregulation of the purine de novo synthesis pathway was the cause of these changes. Strong tumor cell apoptosis was induced by the suppression of de novo purine synthesis through mTORC1-PRPS1 axis. PRPS1, the rate-limit enzyme involving in purine synthesis was regulated by mTORC1 activity. In summary, RMC-4627 and RMC-6272 demonstrate improved <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo <\/i>inhibition of mTORC1 in comparison to rapamycin, and induced more cell death in preclinical models, indicating the potential of bi-steric mTORC1-selective inhibitors as a novel therapeutic strategy to treat tumors with mTORC1 dysregulation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"mTOR,EIF4E,Targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Heng Du<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yu Chi Yang<sup>2<\/sup>, Heng-Jia Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Min Yuan<sup>3<\/sup>, John Asara<sup>3<\/sup>, Kwok-Kin Wong<sup>4<\/sup>, Mallika Singh<sup>5<\/sup>, David Kwiatkowski<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Revolution Medicines Inc., Redwood, CA,<sup>3<\/sup>Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA,<sup>4<\/sup>New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY,<sup>5<\/sup>Revolution Medicines Inc, Redwood, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"078623fa-8a1f-4970-ba56-c8889e70aa64","ControlNumber":"4660","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

TTFields therapy is approved for treatment of adult patients with glioblastoma (GBM) or unresectable pleural mesothelioma. Clinical trials are underway in other solid tumors, including ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The objective of this study is to identify possible mechanisms involved in reduced sensitivity of cancer cell to TTFields, and explore strategies to circumvent them.<br \/>Methods: Ovarian cancer A2780, GBM U-87 MG, and NSCLC H1299 cells with reduced sensitivity to TTFields were generated by continuous long-term application of TTFields. Luminex multiplex assay was employed to examine changes in signaling pathways in these cells, and specific pathway markers were validated by Western blot. <i>In vivo<\/i> validation was performed by immunohistochemistry of ovarian cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and NSCLC tumor sections from animals treated with TTFields. Next, TTFields concomitant with alpelisib, an isoform specific PI3K inhibitor, was evaluated both <i>in vitro<\/i> and in an <i>in-vivo<\/i> model of ovarian cancer.<br \/>Results: TTFields inflicted a continuous cytotoxic effect on the different cancer cells albeit sensitivity to treatment was reduced following prolonged duration of application. Luminex analysis revealed activation of the PI3K\/AKT signaling pathway in treated cells, and kinetics experiments showed that amplitude of AKT signaling increased over time, with significant increases in phosphorylation levels of AKT and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). AKT phosphorylation was also demonstrated in tumor sections of animals treated with TTFields.

Previous work from our lab has shown that copanlisib, a PI3K inhibitor, was found to enhance MHC class I expression in <i>Kras<\/i> mutant CT26 murine colon cancer cells. Here we examine the potential for anti-cancer activity with the combination of copanlisib and anti-PD1 treatments using this model.<br \/><u>Methods:<\/u> The impact of copanlisib on CT26 cells was performed using the WST assay and the expression of MHC class I was assessed using flow cytometry. CT26 flank allografts were generated in Balb\/C mice and subsequently treated for 15 days with copanlisib (10 mg\/kg), anti-PD1 (0.2 mg, BioXCell) or the combination. An IgG2a antibody (BioXCell) was used as a control. Tumors were measured twice a week using a caliper. Tumors were excised, and prepared for immunohistochemistry for CD8, CD4, perforin, granzyme B, and F480 was performed. Staining was quantified as the number of positive staining cells per 20X field of view (FOV).<br \/><u>Results:<\/u> CT26 viability in response to 200 nM copanlisib was relatively unchanged as compared with untreated controls. Via flow cytometry, a 75% increase in mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) for MHC class I was observed comparing control to copanlisib (p=0.003). <i>In vivo, <\/i>after 15 days there was no difference in the growth rate of those cancers treated with control versus copanlisib or anti-PD1. A significant reduction in growth rate was observed with the combination of anti-PD1 with copanlisib compared to the other arms (median fold change=3.62; control: 7.49, p=0.002, copanlisib: 8.88, p=0.003; anti-PD1: 8.93, p=0.002). There were no differences in CD8 T cell and perforin expression between the treatment groups. Granzyme B expression was higher in the combination compared (median\/FOV= 44) to the control (27, p= 0.01). Additionally, a significant reduction in F480 expression was seen in the combination compared to the other treatment groups (median\/FOV=43; control: 139, p&#60;0.001, copanlisib: 110, p&#60;0.001; anti-PD1:149, p&#60;0.001).<br \/><u>Conclusions:<\/u> In conclusion, copanlisib in combination with anti-PD1 demonstrated enhanced anti-tumor activity in Balb\/c mice that were injected with<i> <\/i>CT26 CRC cells.

Despite initial responses to first line platinum- and paclitaxel-based chemotherapies, &#62;70% of ovarian cancers recur with increasingly resistant disease; and nearly all of these women die of their disease. Recently, the use of targeted therapies such as bevacizumab and PARP inhibitors have been shown to improve progression-free survival in a subset of patients. However, these agents have thus far failed to improve overall survival in patients without specific genetic signatures, highlighting the continued need for alternative therapies. Through an unbiased drug screen, we have identified lestaurtinib as a potent inhibitor of many sensitive and resistant ovarian cancer cell lines and patient derived organoid models. Lestaurtinib is a known tyrosine kinase inhibitor originally developed to block FLT3, a protein that is not expressed in any of the ovarian cancer cell lines tested. To elucidate the mechanisms by which lestaurtinib inhibits ovarian cancer cells, we have examined its impact on the phospho-proteome in parallel with RNAseq. Results of these studied have identified inhibition of the JAK\/STAT signaling pathway as a top hit. Assessment of STAT1 and STAT3 has revealed that these transcription factors are constitutively activated in chemotherapy- and PARP inhibitor-resistant cell lines as reflected by high levels of Tyr701\/705 and Ser727 phosphorylation, suggesting that induction of this pathway may drive resistance. Surprisingly, profound differences in the ability of various JAK\/STAT inhibitors to block these specific phosphorylation events is observed, which correlates with their potency. Further, STAT1 and STAT3 ChIPseq experiments following cytokine-mediated activation of this pathway reveal that these transcription factors bind to genomic regions encoding genes involved in oncogenic and drug resistance pathways. Genetic knockdown of STAT1 and STAT3 via siRNA, or knockout via CRISPR\/Cas9, results in significant growth inhibition of sensitive and resistant models of ovarian cancer, confirming their importance in maintaining cell viability. Finally, combining lestuartinib with standard-of-care cisplatin or olaparib (a PARP inhibitor) is shown to be synergistic, indicating that pharmacological inhibition of JAK\/STAT signaling has the potential to counteract drug resistance. Ongoing studies are aimed at further understanding the role of JAK\/STAT signaling in ovarian cancer, elucidating the mechanistic processes by which STAT1\/3 mediate progression of this disease, and identifying the most effective pharmacological strategies to study in possible future clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Resistance,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Esther Rodman<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Emch<sup>1<\/sup>, Elizabeth Bruinsma<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiaonan Hou<sup>2<\/sup>, Scott Kaufmann<sup>2<\/sup>, Saravut  J.

Recently, tumor molecular classification identified clinically refractory SEM (i.e., Stem-like, EMT and Mesenchymal) subtype GC which exhibited over-expression of the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) whose role is circumventing calcium overload causing ER stress and apoptosis. Here, we showed that PMCA4 is associated with Wnt signaling activity by regulating Secreted Frizzled-Related Protein 2 (SFRP2) expression and demonstrated that PMCA4 inhibition might achieve dual mechanism-specific anti-cancer effect by inducing calcium-mediated apoptosis and restraining oncogenic Wnt activity in SEM subtype GC.<br \/>Materials and Methods: GC cell lines and patient-derived organoids (PDOs) were categorized either SEM-subtype (SNU484, SNU668, SK4, MKN1; GA077T, GA265T, GA333T, GA352T) or non-SEM subtype (MKN45, NCIN87, SNU16, SNU601; GA200T, GA247T, GA215T) based on transcriptome signatures or subtype-specific biomarker genes. PMCA4 expression was confirmed using western blot and its calcium clearance function was examined using Fluo-4 AM fluorescent Ca2+ dye. Biological and molecular characteristics of GC cell lines and PDOs upon PMCA4 inhibition were investigated using RT-qPCR, western blot, and TOPflash\/FOPflash reporter assay. The target engagement of novel PMCA inhibitor PM058 (bis-indole maleimide derivative) was evaluated by cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), and the efficacy was determined by CCK8 cell viability assay for cell lines and by Cell Titer-Glo for PDOs.Results: PMCA4 was highly expressed in SEM subtype GC cell lines and PDOs. The siRNA-mediated PMCA4 knockdown (KD) or pharmaceutical inhibition of PMCA4 suppressed the calcium clearance, the cell viability, and decreased cell invasion\/migration. TCF\/LEF-responsive reporter assay revealed that pharmaceutical inhibition of PMCA4 suppressed Wnt\/beta-catenin signaling activity, proven by decrease in beta-catenin and Wnt target gene expression. PMCA inhibition was mechanistically associated with the increased expression of SFRP2, a Wnt antagonist. Importantly, PM058, a PMCA inhibitor, treatment resulted in highly efficacious anti-cancer effect in PDOs at nano molar range, which correlated with PMCA4 protein expression.Discussion and Conclusion: Our results provide the proof of concept that PMCA4 can be a promising therapeutic target for refractory subtype cancer. The proposed mechanism of PMCA4 inhibition is calcium overload - induced apoptosis and interfering with Wnt signaling activity via SFRP2 in GC. Importantly, we demonstrated a novel potent inhibitor PM058 that blocks PMCA function in clinically intractable SEM subtype GC cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Organoids,Molecular subtypes,Wnt signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Saeli Ban<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jungmin Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Jonghwan Bae<sup>1<\/sup>, Ki Cheong Park<sup>3<\/sup>, Suji Lee<sup>4<\/sup>, Moon Hwan Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Jae-Ho Cheong<sup>5<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>VERAVERSE Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Surgery, Yonsei University Health System, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Severance Biomedical Science Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Surgery, Yonsei University Health System, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Surgery, Yonsei University Health System, Yonsei University College of Medicine, VERAVERSE Co., Ltd.; Severance Biomedical Science Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cb486f1a-b27b-4d69-a18a-0fe507b62d15","ControlNumber":"4289","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

As a result, various ALK-TKIs have been rapidly developed, some of which were already approved while some are being tested in clinical trials. Death receptor 4 (DR4; also called TNFRSF10A or TRAIL-R1) is a cell surface protein, which is supposed to function as a pro-apoptotic protein that transduces TRAIL death signal to trigger apoptosis. Its expression is positively regulated by MEK\/ERK signaling and thus can be downregulated by MEK\/ERK inhibition. This study thus focused on determining the effects of AKL inhibition on DR4 expression and the underlying mechanisms. ALK-TKIs such as brigatinib and alectinib effectively and preferentially inhibited AKT\/mTOR as well as MEK\/ERK signaling and decreased cell survival in ALK-mutant (ALKm) NSCLC cells with induction of apoptosis. This was also true to DR4 downregulation, which occurred even at 2 h post treatment. These ALK-TKIs did not affect DR4 protein stability, rather potently decreased DR4 mRNA expression. In parallel, they promoted degradation and decreased the levels of Fra-1 and c-Jun, two critical components of AP-1, and suppressed AP-1 (Fra-1\/c-Jun)-dependent transcription\/expression of DR4. Hence, it appears that ALK-TKIs downregulate DR4 expression in ALKm NSCLC cells via facilitating Fra-1 and c-Jun degradation and subsequent AP-1 suppression. Our findings thus warrant further investigation on elucidating the biological significance of DR4 downregulation in ALK-targeted cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ALK,Death receptors,AP-1,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Wen Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, Danlei Yu<sup>1<\/sup>, Yifan Zhai<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Shi-Yong Sun<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Emory University, Atlanta, GA,<sup>2<\/sup>Ascentage Pharma (Suzhou) Co., Ltd, Suzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ed6dcd05-d66b-4d60-bf9e-89de3c521400","ControlNumber":"5165","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>W.

Yet EGFR is not mutated in chordoma, leaving the mechanisms associated with EGFR inhibitor (EGFRi) sensitivity and resistance unclear. In this study, we profiled a panel of over 10 chordoma cell lines to categorize their sensitivity to afatinib, a second-generation EGFRi with potency against the wild-type receptor. Several cell lines, including U-CHCF365, UM-Chor1, MUG-Chor1, and U-CH1, were highly sensitive to afatinib in cell viability assays, with absolute IC50 values below 50 nanomolar. In contrast, other chordoma cell lines, including UM-Chor5C and U-CHCF359B, exhibited limited response to EGFRi at concentrations exceeding 1 micromolar. Among sensitive cell lines, we found that afatinib promoted cell death in some cases (e.g., U-CH1) whereas in others it induced a profound cell cycle arrest. Moreover, in U-CH1 cells, acute afatinib treatment enriched a population of drug-tolerant persister cells with a fusiform morphology, potentially indicative of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Ongoing studies are focused on understanding the mechanisms of afatinib-induced cell death, drug tolerance, and acquired resistance, with a view to designing rational combination strategies capable of enhancing the magnitude and duration of therapeutic response. In cell lines with matched xenograft models, in vitro responses to afatinib were consistent in vivo. In a panel of 12 chordoma patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models treated with afatinib or cetuximab, differential sensitivity to EGFRi was recapitulated - with EGFRi promoting complete or negligent tumor growth inhibition in sensitive or resistant models, respectively. Finally, we combined drug sensitivity profiling of chordoma cell lines and PDXs with whole-exome and whole-transcriptome sequencing to identify genomic and transcriptomic features associated with sensitivity and resistance to EGFRi in chordoma. Collectively, our data identify a striking degree of differential sensitivity to EGFRi in chordoma, and begin to shed light on factors associated with primary and acquired resistance. These results provide a framework for guiding patient selection and identifying potential combination therapy regimens to improve EGFRi efficacy and address resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,EGFR TKI resistance,Personalized medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Nindo Punturi<sup><\/sup>, Lee Dolat<sup><\/sup>, Joan Levy<sup><\/sup>, Josh Sommer<sup><\/sup>, <b>Daniel M.

Approximately 10-50% of patients with NSCLC harbor EGFR activating mutations, such as in-frame deletions in exon 19 (Ex19del). Currently, for patients with advanced NSCLC, testing for sensitizing mutations in <i>EGFR<\/i> is mandatory prior to the administration of anti-EGFR inhibitors such as Osimertinib. The CAM xenograft offers a rich environment in nutrients and embryonic growth factors, favorable for aggressive tumor development, with its highly vascularized membrane and natural immunodeficiency at engraftment (at EDD9).<br \/>Methods: HCC827 Ex19del cells have been engrafted <i>in ovo<\/i>, and treated with various doses of osimertinib for seven days (4 treatments). The xenografts were collected and immunohistopathological, transcriptional and genetic analyses were carried out. Based on human transcriptional data, supervised multivariate discrimination between conditions and ontology analysis was performed through GSEA.<br \/>Results: The xenograft growth was inversely dependent on the exposure dose of osimertinib, with a reduction in tumor weight of 58% for 10 &#181;M (corresponding to 8.3 &#181;g\/Kg, T<sub>1\/2 <\/sub>=4hr). The histological analysis showed epithelial tumor cells composed of solid sheets. The quantity of tumor cells was significantly lower in the treated group, with an area of tumor necrosis. The immunohistochemistry of tumor cells confirmed the human pulmonary epithelial origin, with TTF1 positive in treated and control groups. As expected, the ontology analysis of transcriptomic findings highlighted a downregulation of the EGFR pathway and its downstream effectors. Furthermore, the transcriptomic responses associated with chemotaxis, immune cell recruitment, and angiogenesis were dampened in the presence of osimertinib. This suggests that therapeutic efficacy was not uniquely guided through cell-autonomous mechanisms, but also takes place at the tissue level. We confirmed this in an independent experiment of <i>in ovo<\/i> HCC827 engraftment, showing a statically significant reduction of 15% in the number of vessels surrounding the xenograft in the osimertinib-treated condition. This demonstrates the advantage of using the <i>in ovo<\/i> model to decipher the regulations associated with therapeutics in a complex tissue context.<br \/>Conclusions: For the first time, we have observed that osimertinib modulates angiogenesis and chemotaxis, which apparently reduces immune system recruitment and immune checkpoint responses. The ontologic analysis of transcriptomic findings in the CAM model strongly support the clinical observations of the pharmacological tumoral response to targeted therapy. The fact that immune infiltration was reduced in osimertinib-treated tumors may partially explain the lower response to immunotherapy regimens in osimertinib resistance contexts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI),Transcriptomic analysis,chicken Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) xenograft,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>David Barthelemy<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Arnaud Vigneron<sup>2<\/sup>, Xavier Rousset<sup>3<\/sup>, Jerome Guitton<sup>1<\/sup>, Emmanuel Grolleau<sup>1<\/sup>, Margaux Raffin<sup>1<\/sup>, Julie Balandier<sup>1<\/sup>, Gaelle Lescuyer<sup>1<\/sup>, Florence Geiguer<sup>1<\/sup>, Sebastien Couraud<sup>1<\/sup>, Jean Vaillet<sup>3<\/sup>, Nazim Benzerdjeb<sup>1<\/sup>, Lea Payen-Gay<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud - HCL, Pierre Benite, France,<sup>2<\/sup>Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, INSERM 1052, CNRS 5286, Centre Léon Bérard, Centre de Recherche en Cancérologie de Lyon, Lyon, France,<sup>3<\/sup>Inovotion, Grenoble, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9801ec3e-a123-417b-8ed6-0129f625f675","ControlNumber":"2586","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

Combination platinum-based chemotherapy has long been the mainstay in the treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC); however, over the last decade there have been significant advances in systemic therapy, which includes the FDA approval of the pan-FGFR inhibitor erdafitinib (approved for tumors with FGFR2\/3 alterations) and the antibody drug conjugate (ADC) enfortumab vedotin (which targets the cell surface protein Nectin-4). Despite these advances, most patients with mUC will progress and succumb from their disease, highlighting the need for further therapeutic development. In parallel to therapeutic advances, there have been significant advances in the molecular characterization of UC, including identification of luminal and basal subsets. <i>NECTIN4<\/i> and <i>FGFR3<\/i> alterations are known to be enriched in luminal subtypes and we have found, via query of the TCGA data, that <i>NECTIN4<\/i> expression was significantly higher in <i>FGFR3<\/i> altered tumors. Given this association we sought to investigate the effect of FGFR3 activity on Nectin-4 expression. Using erdafitinib, in select luminal UC cell lines (RT112, RT4, SW780) with FGFR3 fusion proteins, we found, much to our surprise, that FGFR inhibition increased Nectin-4 expression. Western blots, probing for Nectin-4, following 24H, 48H, and 72H of treatment with erdafitinib (50 nM) showed a significant increase in protein expression in all three cell lines. Importantly, we consistently saw increased expression of what we believe corresponds to the membrane bound form of Nectin-4 and have now confirm such by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence probing for Nectin-4 in the RT112 cell line. We have also seen statistically significant increases in <i>NECTIN4<\/i> on RT-PCR following treatment with erdafitinib; however, we believe that Nectin-4 regulation by FGFR inhibition is not merely transcriptional because the induction of Nectin-4 protein appears significantly greater than the fold increase in mRNA. Notably, in two additional UC cell lines (HT1376 - a luminal cell line with high Nectin-4 expression &#38; UMUC3 - a basal cell line with low Nectin-4 expression), with no alterations in FGFR3, we did not see a significant change in Nectin-4 expression following treatment with erdafitinib. Based on our above results, we hypothesize that FGFR3 inhibition, in tumors harboring FGFR3 alterations, may act as a sensitize agent to Nectin-4 ADC targeted therapy; however, our results are preliminary and further investigation, particularly with in vivo models, is warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Therapeutics,Preclinical,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sean Clark-Garvey<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mi Zhou<sup>2<\/sup>, Andrew Truong<sup>3<\/sup>, Wolfgang Beckabir<sup>4<\/sup>, Michael Sturdivant<sup>3<\/sup>, William Kim<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Division of Oncology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC,<sup>2<\/sup>Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC,<sup>3<\/sup>Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Pharmacology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC,<sup>4<\/sup>Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"dbb83da3-84ba-4b1f-9619-bc5454a1f080","ControlNumber":"7418","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Approximately 50% of patients with PCa harbor an oncogenic TMPRRS2- ERG gene fusion in their primary tumor and 35% of patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancers have the gene fusion. We have identified a potent small molecule inhibitor, ERGi-USU-6 salt derivative 7b, that selectively inhibits the growth of ERG positive tumor. This small molecule inhibitor is also effective in inhibiting the growth of benign and cancerous mouse prostate organoids expressing TMPRSS2-ERG (ERG positive organoids). To gain insights into the cancer-selective properties of ERGi-USU-6 salt 7b we evaluated pathways associated in ERGi-USU induced inhibition.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The biological activities of salt derivative 7b, were assessed in hormone- refractory metastatic tumor derived ERG positive prostate cancer cell line, VCaP along with organoids. We monitored the pathways associated in the mechanism of drug action through, cell cycle-regulator proteins by immunoblot assays, cell cycle and ferroptosis related analyses in response to 7b treatment. We also monitored the levels of the RIOK2 kinase,<br \/>previously shown to bind the parental ERGi-USU compound. The normal primary endothelium derived HUVEC cells were used as normal control due to the normal endogenous expression of ERG in endothelial cells including HUVEC.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Cell growth and immunoblot analysis indicated the inhibition of ERG positive prostate organoid upon ERGi-USU treatments resulting in the downregulation of ERG and RIOK2 protein levels. The cell cycle analyses, pathway mapping by protein assessment and ferroptotic assays suggests that salt derivative 7b treatment inhibits the ERG positive prostate cancer through ferroptosis along with RIOK2 inhibition.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Our results showed that the ferroptosis inducer ATF3 gene is involved in the cancer-selective activity of ERGi-USU-6 salt derivative 7b.

Melitherapy is a novel therapeutic platform based on the regulation of the membrane&#8217;s structure and organization with the consequent modulation of certain cell signals. In this context, 2-hydroxioleic acid (2OHOA, LAM561, INN: idroxioleic acid) has been developed for the treatment of GBM and is currently running a phase IIB\/III clinical trial for newly diagnosed GBM patients. 2OHOA modulates the lipid composition and structure of cancer cells, increasing membranes fluidity and altering the activity of membrane-associated proteins, inhibiting the proliferation, inducing ER stress and differentiation, and finally triggering cell death by autophagy. The Notch signaling pathway has been highly related to tumorigenesis and cell survival driving the pathogenesis of GBM. In this work, we studied whether 2OHOA modulates the Notch pathway and its relevance in its mechanism of action (MoA) as an antitumoral drug. For this purpose, the 2OHOA&#8217;s effect on different components of the pathway was studied by western-blot, Q-PCR, and confocal microscopy. In addition, Notch receptor processing and NICD formation (final effector) were analyzed by cell fractionation and Notch processing enzymes activity, like furin, was evaluated upon 2OHOA treatment. First, the inhibition of this pathway in GBM cells by 2OHOA was confirmed by (i) lower expression levels of some of its components (Notch1, Notch3, and Jagged) and target genes (Hes1, CD3), (ii) less nuclear presence of NICD and Hes1 after 2OHOA treatment, (iii) accumulation of full-length Notch receptor in the membranes, impairing its processing and the NICD formation. Second, the relevance of Notch pathway in 2OHOA&#8217;s MoA was determined by the partial hindering of 2OHOA antiproliferative effect by Hes1 overexpression. Moreover, the reduction of Hes1 expression induced by the drug in different GBM cells correlated positively with their sensitivity to 2OHOA. Finally, 2OHOA downregulated furin-like proteases activity by physical association, an enzyme responsible for the Notch processing first step. All together reveals that the inhibition of Notch pathway by 2OHOA plays a role in its antitumoral effect, and this event is unleashed by the direct furin enzyme inhibition, identifying it as a novel target for this drug in the GBM and other pathologies treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-04 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Notch,idroxioleic,Lipids,Glioblastoma multiforme,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Raquel Rodríguez-Lorca<sup>1<\/sup>, Roberto Beteta-Göbel<sup>1<\/sup>, Ramón Román<sup>1<\/sup>, Manuel Torres<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Victoria Llado<\/b><sup>3<\/sup>, Pablo  V.

NMT has been suggested as a target in cancers, but there has been a lack of rationale to identify patients who may respond to NMT inhibition. Additionally, the mechanism of action of NMT inhibitors (NMTi) is difficult to dissect, as NMT substrates feature in multiple biological pathways, and many studies have focused only on a single substrate. Here, a combination of bioinformatic, biochemical, proteomic, and cellular biology techniques have been combined to show that deregulation of MYC-family proteins sensitizes cells to NMT inhibition. Cell lines sensitive to NMTi were identified through screening of hundreds of cancer cell lines, and the transcriptome of sensitive and insensitive lines compared to obtain a &#8220;Sensitive to NMTi&#8221; gene set. This gene set correlated well with MYC-related gene sets and mutation, amplification, or chromosomal rearrangement in MYC(N) were predictive for NMTi sensitivity, suggesting that MYC deregulated cancer cells are sensitive to NMTi. This was verified by cytotoxicity assays in B-cell lymphoma and neuroblastoma lines, where highly MYC(N) expressing lines exhibited increased NMTi sensitivity, including in the SHEP21N and P493-6 lines, in which MYC(N) levels can be regulated. Furthermore, proteomic profiling identified multiple pathways which are affected by NMTi, and these were further validated. In particular, an impact on Complex I formation was seen, and mitochondrial dysfunction in high MYC(N) cells upon NMTi was seen through the loss of basal and maximal respiration, ATP production and spare respiratory capacity. Loss of Complex I formation was shown to be caused by the loss of the NMT substrate NDUFAF4 upon NMTi treatment. Furthermore, application of an orally bioavailable NMTi eliminated tumors in mouse models of both diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and neuroblastoma and were well tolerated with no changed in body weight, suggesting that NMT inhibitors are well tolerated and efficacious in vivo.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-04 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroblastoma,Myc,Drug sensitivity,MYCN,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>James Zhang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Gregor  A.

Autophagy is initiated through ULK1\/2 kinases and is triggered by inhibitors of the MAPK and PI3K pathways. Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are driven by mutations in KIT kinase. KIT signals through MAPK\/PI3K pathways, suppressing ULK1\/2 kinases and autophagy<sup>1,2,3<\/sup>. Inhibition of mutant KIT reverses this suppression, activating autophagy and cancer cell survival. Approved therapies for GIST include imatinib, sunitinib, regorafenib, ripretinib, and avapritinib. Treatment with these inhibitors is initially successful, but drug resistance can develop either through KIT secondary mutations or ASR pathways including autophagy. DCC-3116 is a selective, potent, first-in-class investigational inhibitor of the ULK1\/2 in clinical development in combination with targeted therapies that activate the autophagic ASR pathway. Herein we demonstrate that ULK1\/2 and autophagy are activated upon treatment with ripretinib in KIT mutant GIST models. <sup> <\/sup> A combination of ripretinib with DCC-3116 inhibits autophagy <i>in vitro<\/i> and leads to complete tumor regressions in preclinical models of GIST.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Inhibition of ULK1\/2 in cell assays was measured using an ELISA for the ULK substrate phospho-ATG13 (pATG13).

DCC-3116 potently inhibited flux with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> value of 38 nM. Ripretinib also induced pATG13 and autophagic flux (1.5-2.5-fold) in multiple imatinib-resistant cell lines, which was inhibited by DCC-3116 with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values between 8-189 nM.

Drug resistance, blood brain barrier (BBB) impermeability, and drug toxicity are some caveats in treating this malignancy. Current chemotherapeutic agents fail to address these challenges. In this study, we aim to repurpose an FDA-approved anti-psychotic agent Pimavanserin Tartrate (PVT), for the treatment of GBM and further delineate its mechanism. To unravel the oncolytic effects of PVT, cytotoxicity assay on several human (SF268, SF188, SF295, U251) and murine (CT2A-Luc) GBM cell lines was performed. Our results demonstrate that PVT inhibited the growth of various GBM cells with IC<sub>50<\/sub> ranging 5 to 8 &#181;M, contrary to Temozolomide (TMZ), a standard care therapy which has an IC<sub>50<\/sub> ranging 600 to 1,300 &#181;M after 48- and 72-hours of treatment. Moreover, PVT treatment enhanced the activity of TMZ when given in combination. Pro-apoptotic proteins such as cleaved caspase-3 and Bax were upregulated by PVT treatment as evaluated confirming apoptosis to be the mode of cell death. The apoptotic cell population increased in a dose-dependent fashion, for example, 10&#181;M PVT exhibited 70% increase in apoptosis as observed in the annexin assay. PVT treatment suppressed the phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt, and increased the expression of FOXO proteins, which are the negative downstream regulators of Akt. FOXO proteins translocate to the nucleus leading to the enhanced transcription of Bim, a pro-apoptotic protein resulting in apoptosis. Oral administration of 10mg\/kg PVT significantly suppressed the growth of intracranially implanted GBM tumors without any other organ toxicity. Our observations provide a robust foundation for PVT&#8217;s anti-cancer efficacy against GBM by modulating Akt\/FOXO\/Bim pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-04 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Drug discovery,Akt,Brain tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Manas Yogendra Agrawal<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sharavan Ramachandran<sup><\/sup>, Carson Zabel<sup><\/sup>, Sanjay  K.

Previous studies indicated that hyperforin has other potentially pharmacologically meaningful biological properties, including antibacterial ability and inhibition of inflammatory mediators. Numerous studies have also pointed out the anti-tumor potential of hyperforin is associated with the induction of apoptosis signaling. However, whether hyperforin may regulate CRC progression and its underlying mechanism is unclear. In our study, we used the MTT assay to prove the cytotoxicity of CRC cells (HT29 and HCT116 cells) was induced by hyperforin. We then used the flow cytometry to confirmed that hyperforin may induce both extrinsic\/intrinsic apoptotic pathways in CRC cells. We further demonstrated hyperforin-induced apoptosis pathways is associated with mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis and death receptor dependent apoptosis. Then, transwell invasion, migration, and wound healing assay results proved the inhibition effect by hyperforin in HT29 and HCT116 cells. Additionally, we suggested that hyperforin can effectively inhibit EGFR downstream genes MEK-ERK and AKT signaling, as well as inhibit the phosphorylation of NF-&#922;B and the nuclear translocation in CRC cells. In sum, our results show that hyperforin can inhibit the apoptosis and metastasis ability of CRC cells by inhibiting both AKT\/NF- &#922;B and ERK\/ NF-&#922;B signaling pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Natural products,EGFR,NF-&#954;B,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ying-Tzu Chen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, I-Tsang Chiang<sup>2<\/sup>, Yuan Chang<sup>3<\/sup>, Fei-Ting Hsu<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Chine Medical University, (Individual), Taichung, Taiwan,<sup>2<\/sup>Medical Administrative Center, Show Chwan Memorial Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Medical Imaging, Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, New Taipei City, Taiwan,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"25fd0c64-b636-4162-9cf1-de580f0b5484","ControlNumber":"2765","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

GSK-3&#946; is a serine threonine kinase often overexpressed in solid tumors and a positive regulator of NF-&#954;B which promotes tumor growth and chemotherapy resistance. 9-ING-41 is a maleimide-based small molecule that crosses the blood brain barrier and selectively inhibits GSK-3&#946;. Previously we demonstrated that 9-ING-41 decreases ETMR and ATRT cell viability through apoptosis and increases p53 signaling, however the exact mechanism leading to its activation is unknown. This study aims to determine the optimal dosing for 9-ING-41 and describe the phenotypic response of these cell lines to 9-ING-41 using cell viability assay, western blotting and neurosphere assay. This information will help further elucidate the mechanism of action for this drug.<br \/><u><\/u> <u>Methods<\/u> ATRT cell lines ATRT 2141, ATRT-787199, ATRT 803499, LCH-091-07 and the ETMR cell line BT-183 were grown for 24hrs prior to 9-ING-41 treatment in DMEM and Neurocult medium, respectively. Cell viability was assessed after 72hrs of treatment using Cell Titer Glo 2.0. Western blots were analyzed for XIAP, cleaved caspase-3, p53, MDM2 after 24 and 48 hours at 200nM, 400nM and 600nM. Neurosphere assays were done by seeding two cells per well in a 96-well plate followed by treatment with 9-ING-41. Neurosphere frequency and size was monitored weekly for up to 4 weeks using Incucyte&#174; S3 software. Pearson&#8217;s correlation graph was generated to determine the relationship between GSK-3&#946; expression and sensitivity to 9-ING-41.

We observed decreased expression of NF-&#954;B mediated anti-apoptotic marker XIAP and an increase in expression of apoptotic marker cleaved caspase-3 and tumor suppressor p53 in response to 9-ING-41. MDM2, a negative regulator of p53 had a significant increase in expression indicating it is not responsible for p53 increase which may suggest ATM pathway could be responsible for regulating p53 increase.

In the setting of BRAF-mutant melanoma, for instance, a majority of patients relapse within one year of initiating targeted therapy. Combination therapies blocking compensatory signaling pathways provide a strategy for boosting treatment efficacy and delaying resistance. To find synergistic kinase inhibitor combinations, we used a multimodal systems pharmacology approach to quantify the early adaptive signaling and gene regulatory dynamics in patient-derived BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup>-mutant melanoma cells under oncogene inhibition. Cells were treated with vemurafenib or vehicle and sampled longitudinally at timepoints spanning minutes to days. To measure signaling dynamics, thousands of protein phosphorylation sites covering commonly altered signaling axes in cancer were motif-enriched by immunoprecipitation, barcoded with isobaric tandem mass tags (TMT), and quantified by high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS). The resulting time-resolved phosphoproteomics data showed rapid (&#60;15 minutes) and potent (&#62;8-fold) downregulation of ERK1\/2, confirming strong BRAF inhibition. Statistical integration of signaling measurements with time-series RNA-seq data collected at the same timepoints enabled reconstruction of multi-scale regulatory networks governing the adaptive response to oncogene inhibition. In particular, we observed early induction of SRC-family kinase (SFK) signaling and a broad cytoskeletal signaling module, implicating a compensatory prosurvival signaling program. The induction intensified over the 3-day treatment window and was fully reversed following a 6-day drug holiday, suggesting a reversible nature of drug adaptation. Immunoblotting confirmed sustained loss of ERK1\/2 activity and concomitant elevated SFK phosphorylation following drug treatment. Accumulation of reactive oxygen species, a known activator of SFKs, strongly correlated with SFK activity, and both were ablated following treatment with the antioxidant precursor N-acetylcysteine. This adaptive response predicted a significant degree of synergy between vemurafenib and the pan-SFK inhibitor dasatinib, which was validated in a panel of patient-derived melanoma cell lines and in melanoma xenograft mouse models. Targeted MS of phospho-ERK1\/2 and canonical SFK substrates, including CTTN, PXN, and PAG1, validated the mechanism of action of this combination. Complementary data from patient-derived non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells under tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment demonstrates the generality of our integrative approach, and supports the notion that SFK activation may be a hallmark response to oncogenic RTK-RAS-ERK pathway inhibition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,Precision medicine,Systems biology,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Cameron  T.

Importantly, the amplifications and mutations in SF3B1, the pioneer splicing factor, are reportedly far more common than those in other splicing factors. However, the functional relevance and underlying mechanisms of dysregulated SF3B1 in endometrial cancer are not investigated. Endometrial cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women in the United States and there will be about 65,950 new endometrial cancer cases in the current year alone with 12,550 estimated cancer deaths in the United States. In this study, we thus investigated the role of SF3B1 in endometrial adenocarcinoma. We found SF3B1 is one of the most frequently amplified or mutated splicing factors in endometrial cancer. Specifically, analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) uterine pan-cancer dataset revealed that up to 9% of endometrial cancers have SF3B1 mutations or amplification. Additionally, we showed that the SF3B1 protein is overexpressed in human as well as mouse endometrial tumor samples. Further analysis found elevated SF3B1 protein in multiple endometrial cancer cell lines even in the absence of SF3B1 mutations. However, we did not observe any altered expression at the transcript level. Further, we identified a correlation between the over-expressed SF3B1 levels and the tumorigenicity\/invasive potential of cancer cell lines. For instance, endometrial cancer cell lines (Ishikawa, AN3CA, KLE) with over-expressed SF3B1 levels were much more tumorigenic and invasive than those with low endogenous SF3B1 levels (normal human endometrial epithelial cells, RL-95-2 cells). Moreover, cell viability assays revealed that Ishikawa, AN3CA, and KLE cells were more susceptible to the loss of SF3B1 or treatment with the SF3B1 inhibitor Pladienolide-B (PLAD-B) than RL-95-2 cells. To further ensure that overexpressed or mutated SF3B1 drives endometrial tumorigenesis, we transiently transfected an empty vector or a vector expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type SF3B1 or vector with mutated SF3B1 construct R957Q into RL-95-2 cells which have minimal endogenous SF3B1. Analysis of proliferation assays revealed that cells overexpressing SF3B1 proliferated significantly more than cells expressing empty vector. Intriguingly, we observed that RL-95-2 cells over-expressing R957Q mutants were even more proliferative than the cells expressing wild-type SF3B1. Together, this data suggest that SF3B1 over-expression and mutation play a crucial oncogenic role in endometrial cancer, and these findings may support the development of SF3B1 inhibitors to treat this disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-01 Cell cycle mechanisms of anticancer drug action,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,Alternative splicing,Spliceosome,Splice variants,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Pooja Popli<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Xinchao Deng<sup>2<\/sup>, Premal Thaker<sup>2<\/sup>, Ramakrishna Kommagani<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5dece964-1bdc-4f75-ab60-b85e17cf07ea","ControlNumber":"7290","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

Relapsed and refractory tumors respond poorly to targeted signaling inhibitors due to pathway redundancies in this genetically heterogenous disease. Pharmacologic disruption of the cap-initiation complex eIF4F is an emerging clinical treatment strategy to bypass resistance. In preclinical experiments, B-lymphomas show high susceptibility to rocaglates, natural and synthetic cap-dependent translation inhibitors. Among these compounds, eFT226 (zotatifin), is currently in phase I\/II clinical evaluation for solid tumors. Rocaglate mechanisms remain incompletely defined for use in B-cell lymphoma. Recent findings in our laboratory revealed translationally mediated adaptation that increased synthesis of many targets. Proteins (i.e.CD98hc) that paradoxically increase in production contribute to persistence of cells that survive treatment. By contrast, transcriptional responses to rocaglates remain minimally studied. Here we sought to fill this gap through unbiased transcriptomics.<br \/><b>Method:<\/b> RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on zotatifin treated DLBCL cells (SU-DHL10) vs DMSO controls.

Past studies have suggested that the ability of TA to block Plasminogen activation may be useful for ablating the growth or invasion of cancer. Based on the similarity of TA to the amino acid Lysine we hypothesize that TA might exhibit novel mechanisms of action independent of blocking Plasminogen activation. Analysis of a series of signaling pathways indicated that TA inhibits phosphorylation of S6K1 and STAT3 on sites required for their activation and reduces expression of the MYC oncogene in a concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly, MYC transformed MCF10A human mammary epithelial cells exhibited enhanced sensitivity to TA-mediated reduction of cell viability, suggesting that TA may exhibit selectivity for MYC overexpressing breast cancers. Treatment of breast tumor bearing mice with TA strongly blocked tumor growth and was associated with extensive cancer cell death compared with control tumors. Analysis of extracts from TA or vehicle treated tumors showed that TA blocked S6K1 phosphorylation in vivo in a statistically significant manner. Since S6K1 phosphorylation is regulated by amino acid levels, we hypothesized that due to the structural similarity between TA and Lysine and Arginine, TA may block Lysine or Arginine uptake by blocking cationic amino acid transporters (CATs). Molecular docking simulations utilizing the structure of the bacterial CAT predicted that TA binds to CAT with affinity similar to that of Lysine. Amino acid uptake experiments performed with radiolabeled Arginine and Lysine showed that TA blocked both Arginine and Lysine absorption by cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Together, these results indicate a novel mechanism by which TA inhibits uptake of Arginine and Lysine, triggering loss of S6K1 activity in parallel with tumor growth inhibition. Initial studies suggest the feasibility of designing TA analogs with significantly improved potency for amino acid transporters, and with corresponding increases in selective toxicity to breast cancer cells. Based on these novel mechanisms of TA action, we expect TA to exhibit anti-cancer activity against a broad range of human malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myc,S6 Kinase,Transporters,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Brian K.

However, the BCRC has been overlooked as a therapeutic target due to homology between the BCRC&#8217;s membrane Ig (mIg) subunit and circulating serum Ig. Previously, we reported the generation of a first-in-class antibody, WBMP-4, to a neo-epitope specific to the mIgM-BCRC, which inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis (Welt et al. 2016).<br \/>Here we evaluate kinase activity in Burkitt lymphoma (CA46) cells treated with WBMP-4 (at 5 and 20 ug\/mL, and at 6 and 24 hours) via the Pamgene phosphotyrosine kinase assay. This assay measures kinase activity in cell lysates using a microarray chip containing peptide sequences that serve as substrate for phophsotyrosine sites on well-characterized signaling proteins. We measure kinase activity at 189 phosphosites using this array, as well as protein expression and phosphorylation of key targets downstream of the BCRC using ELISA, flow cytometry, western blot, and immunohistochemistry, in WBMP-4-treated and untreated IgM-expressing B-cells.<br \/>Our Pamgene analysis reveals widespread kinase modulation following WBMP-4 treatment, with &#62;180 of 189 phosphosites showing a significant change in phosphorylation signal intensity (with &#62;153 showing a significant decrease) upon treatment. Western blot analyses of downstream BCRC kinases similarly show changes in phosphorylation at analyzed phosphosites (ZAP70, mTOR, AKT, and MEK) with WBMP-4 treatment. However, we also find changes in protein expression levels of CD79b, ZAP70, BTK, MEK, Myc (all decreased), and LCK (increased) following WBMP-4 treatment.<br \/>We show that the kinase activity of proteins in multiple signaling pathways is altered upon WBMP-4 binding to the BCRC&#8217;s mIgM, with the vast majority exhibiting a downregulation of phosphorylation. We also find that protein expression is impacted in several kinases directly under the control of the BCRC. We hypothesize that WBMP-4&#8217;s impact on protein expression contributes to BCRC signal disruption and the cytotoxic effect achieved by WBMP-4. For example, WBMP-4 induces a profound reduction in CD79b expression (undetectable by western blot following WBMP-4 treatment), which is consistent with the reduction in CD79a kinase activity found via Pamgene assay. These data support the concept that WBMP-4 binds an epitope on mIgM that is critical to its signal transduction to CD79a\/b.Due to WBMP-4&#8217;s specific targeting of IgM-expressing B-cells, we expect that the toxicities associated with approved therapies upon their interaction with non-lymphatic tissue (e.g. bleeding, infection, cytopenia, arrhythmia, secondary malignancies) will be avoided. With potent anti-tumor activity and expected reduced toxicities, WBMP-4 is a compelling candidate for clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"B cells,Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI),Therapeutic target,Signaling pathways,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Rachel  S.

The phenothiazine (PTZ) class of anti-psychotic agents were originally developed to inhibit dopamine- and serotonin-receptors (DR\/5-HTRs). PTZs have demonstrated anti-cancer properties in numerous studies through a variety of proposed mechanisms, including on-target (DR\/5-HTR) and off-target (e.g. calmodulin (CaM) inhibition) effects. PTZs inhibit DR\/5-HTRs in the low- to mid-nanomolar range whereas anti-cancer effects tend to be observed only at a higher (low micromolar) dose range. Thus, clinical efficacy of existing PTZs may be limited by toxicity of on-target effects (sedation) of these drugs as DR\/5-HTR antagonists. However, it has been unclear whether anti-cancer effects of PTZs are entirely separate from their activity as DR\/5-HTR antagonists. Here we evaluate the <i>in vitro<\/i> anti-cancer efficacy of a novel PTZ analog (CWHM-974, a <i>N<\/i>-benzyl-linked fluphenazine (FLU) derivative), originally developed to treat brain-resident fungal infections, that is a 100-1000-fold less potent DR\/5-HTR antagonist than FLU.<br \/><b>Experimental procedures:<\/b> To evaluate the anti-cancer efficacy of FLU and CWHM-974, we assessed cytotoxicity following 72h exposure against a broad panel of cancer cell lines. To investigate CaM as a target for CWHM-974, we evaluated the correlation between the sensitivity to CMW-974 and sensitivity to the CaM inhibitor W-7 as well as CaM gene expression levels in a panel of cancer cell lines. We also tested the anti-cancer efficacy of a sulfoxide analog of CWHM-974 (SLU-0010894) which lacks CaM binding activity.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We confirmed the anti-cancer efficacy of FLU and demonstrated that CWHM-974 is consistently 2-10-fold more potent than FLU in a broad panel of cancer cell lines. Among the most sensitve cancer cell lines are melanoma, which is a cancer that frequently metastasizes to the brain. Consistent with the hypothesis that CaM is a relevant target for CWHM-974, we found that: 1) CaM mRNA (CALM1) levels are correlated with sensitivity to CWHM-974 ; 2) the activities of CWHM-974 and W7 are correlated, and 3) most importantly, SLU-0010894 does not exhibit anti-cancer activity.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The anti-cancer efficacy of the PTZ derivative CWHM-974 is seperable from DR\/5-HTR antagonism. Our data suggests that further optimization of this compound may preserve the desirable pharmacologic properties for targeting brain cancers while reducing toxicity due to DR\/5-HTR antagonism. Moreover, we provide a variety of evidence suggesting that anti-cancer efficacy of CWHM-974 is associated with CaM binding. Ongoing efforts will characterize the activity of CWHM-974 in mouse models of brain metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-04 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain metastasis,Blood-brain barrier,Drug design,Cytotoxicity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Marion Vanneste<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Anita Venzke<sup>1<\/sup>, Soumitra Guin<sup>2<\/sup>, Damian Krysan<sup>3<\/sup>, Marvin Meyers<sup>2<\/sup>, Michael Henry<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Chemistry, St. Louis University, Saint-Louis, MO,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"05605b82-f5af-4cbf-8a10-a7175e68a99d","ControlNumber":"5486","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Pyrvinium Pamoate (PP), an FDA-approved anthelminthic drug, has been reported to exhibit anti-tumor abilities in multiple cancers. By integrating transcriptomic, network, and molecular analyses, we discovered that PP is broadly effective against Merkel cell carcinoma cell lines, and that PP targets multiple proposed MCC tumorigenesis pathways.<br \/>Methods: We performed time-series RNA-seq profiling on a MCPyV inducible cell model and on PP-treated MCC cell lines, and inferred gene regulatory networks associated with PP response. We then integrated the network models with publicly available MCC tumor profiles and the LINCS L1000 database to explore the targets of PP in MCC. In addition, we performed protein, RNA, growth rate, metabolic, and apoptosis assays on multiple MCC cell lines exposed to PP.<br \/>Results: Analyzing the effect of PP in the L1000 cancer cell line panel suggested that PP could inhibit key drivers of MCC tumorigenesis. We therefore tested the anti-proliferation and pro-apoptosis effects of PP in MCC cell lines. PP effectively inhibits proliferation of MCC at concentrations as low as 100 nM and in a dose and time-dependent manner. RNA-seq analysis of PP treated MCC cells suggested that PP triggers the p53-mediated intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, impairs the mitochondria&#8217;s oxidative phosphorylation function and induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Immunoblotting intrinsic apoptotic pathway protein markers and measuring the IC<sub>50<\/sub> of PP and the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3a in p53<sup>WT<\/sup> and p53<sup>mut<\/sup> or p53<sup>-\/-<\/sup> MCC cell lines, we found that PP does not induce cell apoptosis only through p53 activation, but also through other mechanisms such as increasing Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) stress and decreasing expression of the anti-apoptotic protein survivin (BIRC5). Extracellular flux analysis revealed decreased oxidative phosphorylation rate in PP treated MCC cells. Western blot analysis suggests that PP directly inhibits mitochondria complexes genes ATP5A, MTCO1 and NDUF58 and induces UPR-ER stress. PP has also been reported to inhibit the canonical Wnt pathway. We found that WNT5B, the ligand for the non-canonical Wnt pathway, was significantly decreased in MCC tumors and in our MCPyV inducible cell model, and that PP can upregulate WNT5B significantly. MCC cells treated with WNT5B recombinant protein showed a retarded MCC phenotype.<br \/>Conclusion: Our results suggest that PP exerts anti-tumor activity through both non-specific growth inhibition - via the modulation of mitochondrial function, ER stress, and apoptotic signaling - and more specifically by perturbing the non-canonical Wnt pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Merkel cell carcinoma,Antitumor agents,Bioinformatics,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jiawen Yang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, James  T.

TTFields therapy is versatile with multiple mechanisms of action, including: anti-mitotic effects, downregulation of DNA double strand break repair, generation of replication stress, upregulation of autophagy, and induction of immunogenic cell death. In this research we were interested in identifying common responses to TTFields across cancer types. We addressed this by integrating whole transcriptome analyses of cancers from various origins.<br \/>Methods: Control and TTFields-treated samples examined included gastric, ovarian, pancreatic, non-small cell lung carcinoma, and glioblastoma cell lines, pleural mesothelioma patient-derived cell lines, and a hepatocellular carcinoma animal model. A list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was generated from transcriptomics analysis. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was conducted with the MSigDB, and additional pathway databases. Significantly overlapping pathways were identified using ActivePathways package, and an enrichment map was created according to the number of datasets supporting each pathway.<br \/>Results: The response to TTFields showed a positive correlation of expression across different cell lines and indications, including in an animal model. Downregulation was seen in cell cycle related pathways - E2F targets, Myc targets, G2M checkpoint, and mitotic spindle - indicative of cell cycle arrest, which was mediated by increased expression of tumor suppressors. Several DNA repair pathways were downregulated, including nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, and the Fanconi Anemia-BRCA pathway. Downregulation was also evident in nuclear envelope, DNA and RNA synthesis, metabolism of amino acids, translation, organelle organization, and splicing. Upregulation was observed in genes associated with the cytoskeleton, adhesion, extracellular proteins and transporters. In the majority of comparisons, an upregulation in the immune response was also observed.<br \/>Conclusions: Transcriptomic analysis of datasets from different tumor types revealed common expression patterns and pathways involved in the responses to TTFields. Some of the identified pathways corroborate previously described mechanisms, whereas some reveal new potential mechanisms that require further investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription,Bioinformatics,TTFields,Pan cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Kerem Wainer-Katsir<sup>1<\/sup>, Gitit Lavy-Shahaf<sup>1<\/sup>, Hila Fishman<sup>1<\/sup>, Hila Ena<sup>1<\/sup>, Roni Frechtel-Gerzi<sup>1<\/sup>, Antonia Martinez-Conde<sup>1<\/sup>, Eyal Dor-On<sup>1<\/sup>, Shiri Davidi<sup>1<\/sup>, Sara Jacobovitch<sup>1<\/sup>, Itai Tzchori<sup>1<\/sup>, Yaara Porat<sup>1<\/sup>, Lianghao Ding<sup>2<\/sup>, Michael Story<sup>2<\/sup>, Renfei Du<sup>3<\/sup>, Ulf Kahlert<sup>3<\/sup>, Laura Mannarino<sup>4<\/sup>, Federica Mirimao<sup>5<\/sup>, Monica Lupi<sup>6<\/sup>, Maurizio D’Incalci<sup>4<\/sup>, Adi Haber<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Moshe Giladi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Uri Weinberg<sup>1<\/sup>, Yoram Palti<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Novocure Ltd, Haifa, Israel,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX,<sup>3<\/sup>Molecular and Experimental Surgery, University Clinic for General-, Visceral-, Vascular- and Transplantation Surgery, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Magdeburg, Otto-von Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany,<sup>4<\/sup>1) Laboratory of Cancer Pharmacology, 2) Department of Biomedical Sciences, IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital, Rozzano and Humanitas University, Pieve Emanuele, Milan, Italy,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Oncology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, Milan, Italy,<sup>6<\/sup>Laboratory of Cancer Pharmacology, IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital, Rozzano, Milan, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"344ec378-2735-41f0-b29a-de9ae5418fcd","ControlNumber":"1779","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;K.

COMPARE evaluation of compounds that target components in the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway form correlation clusters linked by both target and pathway. Only 3 of 15 AKT inhibitors in the IOA set are not found in the connected cluster with a COMPARE correlation of 0.7 including the multi-kinase inhibitors perifosine and AT-13148. The AKT cluster includes both allosteric (MK-2206) and competitive inhibitors highlighting the NCI60 is a functional cell assay. More than 75% of PI3K inhibitors (32\/42 agents), including the selective PI3K alpha and PI3K beta inhibitors, form a highly connected cluster at a 0.7 COMPARE correlation. The heat map view showed that &#62;50% of the non-connected PI3K outliers were inactive in the NCI60 assay. The mTOR inhibitors (12\/20) form a connected cluster at 0.7 COMPARE correlation, with half of the non-connected mTOR singletons representative of the rapamycin class of inhibitors. The BRAF\/MEK\/ERK pathway compounds (37) form a highly connected correlation cluster (13\/15 BRAF, 14\/15 MEK, 8\/9 ERK inhibitors) at a 0.75 COMPARE correlation. The NCI60 heat maps for BRAF inhibitors show a consistent pattern of the melanoma cell lines and 2 of the colon cancer lines (COLO 205, HT29). The ERK inhibitors display sensitivity patterns similar to the BRAF agents with additional activity observed against a leukemia (HL-60), ovarian (OVCAR-5) and renal (A498) cell line and 3 other colon cell lines (HCC-298, HCT-116, SW-620).

APR-246 is a small-molecule drug designed to restore WT p53 signaling in TP53-mutant cancers and has yet to be explored in EC. We aimed to test the cytotoxic potential for APR-246 in EC and its downstream impact.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Using 3 parental EC cell lines with differing TP53 statuses, JHUEM2 (WT), Hec108 (hetero P151H), and Hec1B (R248Q), we generated dose-response curves for APR-246. Cells were treated for 24 hours and viability assessed with CellTiter-Glo after 9 days. To assess for mutation specific effect, we generated dose-response curves using a WT non-targeting control (NTC), CRISPR\/Cas9 KO of TP53, and five KO cell lines complemented with 5 common TP53 mutations (R248Q, R248W, R273C, R273H, Y220C). Western blot analysis was performed to assess for p53, p21, PUMA, GADD45, and NOXA using whole-cell lysates, after treatment with 20&#956;M of APR-246 for 24 hours. To further evaluate for a time-dependent effect, 2 representative variants (R248Q and R273C) after 6 and 24 hours of incubation with 50&#956;M APR-246 and 10&#956;M of Nutlin-3.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> APR-246 demonstrated a negative, dose-dependent effect on cell viability in all EC cell lines. IC50s for JHUEM2, Hec108, and Hec1B were 2.5&#956;M, 4.3&#956;M, and 4.5&#956;M respectively. For NTC, the IC50 was (1.7&#956;M), while TP53-KO (7.5&#956;M) demonstrated similar IC50 values to the variants (6.5-11.9&#956;M). Two variants (Y220C and R248W), had significantly (&#38;lt;0.001 and &#38;lt;0.01 respectively) higher IC50 values (11.9 and 9.1 &#956;M respectively). In Western blot analysis, no p53 downstream signaling via p21, GADD45, PUMA, and NOXA was observed for any variants.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our results demonstrate that APR-246's cytotoxic effects in EC seem to be p53-independent. Potential mechanisms for the anti-neoplastic effects of APR-246 include activity targeting antioxidant pathways demonstrated in other solid tumors and provides an area for further investigation in TP53mut EC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,p53,p53 mutations,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Camilla Yu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Aaron Petty<sup><\/sup>, Roberto Vargas<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6f5cf1ff-6d3e-4282-8b59-ee0c8338e76b","ControlNumber":"6239","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

Approximately 80% of patients are diagnosed with advanced stage (FIGO stage III-IV) of ovarian cancer. The standard treatment approach for advanced EOC is primary debulking surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy using taxanes plus platinum. Resistance to platinum based chemo remains a key reason for treatment failure in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Therapeutic efficacy of Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1) and Gamma-glutamyl cysteine Synthetase (&#947;-GCS)inhibitors in ovarian cancer remains undefined, either as a single agent or in combination with cisplatin.<br \/>Material and Methods: We determined the combined effect of PJ34 (PARP1 inhibitor) and BSO (Buthionine-sulfoximine- (&#947;-GCS inhibitor) with cisplatin in ovarian cancer cell lines (OVSAHO, KURAMOCHI, and IGROV1) by MTT assay. PARP1 and GCS levels were analyzed by western blotting. We employed flow cytometry for cell cycle analysis as well as for apoptosis studies. Analysis was done using Graph Pad Prism-6. Results were considered to be statistically significant when p value was &#60; 0.05.<br \/>Results and Conclusion: Combination of cisplatin with PJ34 and BSO augmented cisplatin toxicity in vitro by decreasing cell proliferation and enhancing cell cycle block and cell death when compared with either single agent. A significant cell death (p= &#60;0.05) was observed with the combination of cisplatin, BSO and PJ34.<br \/>Conclusion: In conclusion, our study provide experimental evidence on the combined effect of PARP-1 and GCS inhibition on CDDP-induced cytotoxicity in epithelial ovarian cancer cells. We propose that PARP-1and BSO inhibitors can be combined with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents such as CDDP to enhance the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents and inhibit key signalling pathways involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis. Future comprehensive studies are needed to demonstrate further validation of above combination.<br \/>Keywords: Ovarian Cancer, cisplatin, PARP-1, PJ34, &#947; -GCS, &#946;-actin, Glutathione.<br \/>Abbreviations: Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC), cisplatin (CDDP), Glutathione (GSH), Gamma Glutamyl Cysteine Synthetase (&#947;-GCS), Poly (ADP ribosyl) polymerase-1 (PARP1), Nucleotide excision repair (NER),homologous repair (HR), Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Buthionine Sulfoximine (BSO), Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR), Peripheral Blood (PB).
