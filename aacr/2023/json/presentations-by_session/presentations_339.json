[{"Abstract":"Breast cancer is the most common cancer, and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Brazilian women. Studies have shown that in Brazil while breast cancer mortality has increased in the last decade for all women, mortality in women of African descent has doubled. A recent study showed that Afro-Brazilian women suffer from higher excess breast cancer mortality even after adjusting for extent of disease, year of diagnosis, age and socioeconomic status, which suggests biological factors also contribute to the differences in the clinicopathological make-up of the disease in women in this group. DNA methylation biomarkers, representing a combination of genetic and non-genetic factors, have the potential to be especially valuable when considering the combined contribution of the environment and genetics in breast cancer etiology. Several groups have found differences in DNA methylation levels associated with race and ethnicity in breast cancer. In addition, research has shown that women of different races\/ethnicities with similar breast cancer tumor subtypes have distinct DNA methylation patterns. To explore further the association between race, ancestry and DNA methylation, we conducted a study in paired tumor and non-tumor tissue samples of forty-eight Brazilian women who self-identified as Black or Brown and were treated at National Cancer Institute Breast Cancer Hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We carried out a DNA methylation profiling analysis using Illumina EPIC (850k) arrays in bisulfite converted DNA originally extracted from frozen tissue samples. A total of 739,883 differentially methylated probes (DMP) were identified, of which a large proportion 6,241 (78.4%) were hypomethylated. Lower DNA methylation was more common on intragenic regions and gene bodies, while hypermethylation was more commonly found on the promoter regions. DNA methylation was often higher in non-tumor than tumor samples. Among our top hits we found genes previously associated with estrogen receptor negative tumor types, CDH4, CERK, PROX1 and ADHFE1, and with high risk of breast cancer mortality (ST6GAL1, LYN, TFF1 and BMP3). A DPM enrichment pathway analysis predicted effects in known signaling pathways and transcriptional misregulation. We are currently analyzing the associations between the top differentially methylated regions with ancestry informative markers, and the clinicopathological characteristics of disease, to gain a better understanding of the role of DNA methylation marks in this population. This study adds to our current knowledge on epigenetics marks that will ultimately help us address mortality due to this disease in this population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Epigenetics,DNA methylation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lissette Delgado-Cruzata<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Diego  J.

Peg-asp appears to confer a survival advantage, but use in older adults is limited by concern for toxicity, though incidence and associated factors are poorly characterized. Our primary objective was to compare peg-asp tolerability in different age groups; secondary objectives were assessment of patient- (pt) and disease-dependent factors associated with toxicity. We retrospectively reviewed 58 ALL pts treated with at least 1 dose of peg-asp (500-2500IU\/m2) at our institution between 2016-2021. We used &#967;-squared- and Fisher&#8217;s test, and multivariable regression analysis to assess relationships between pt-factors and toxicities. Median doses received was 2 (range 1-7). 38 pts were 40 years or older, 20 were &#62;60 years. 18 received PEG during induction only, 8 in consolidation only, 27 in both, and 5 during salvage therapy post-relapse. 17 had Philadelphia (Ph) positive B-ALL; 32 Ph negative B-ALL; 7 T-ALL; and 2 had mixed phenotype acute leukemia. Pts were 19-78 years old (median 48.5). Grade 3 or 4 toxicities observed in &#62;10% of cases included hepatotoxicity (81%, 47\/58); antithrombin 3 depletion (72.4%, 42\/58); hypofibrinogenemia &#60;100 (58.6%, 34\/58); hypertriglyceridemia (20.8%, 10\/48); venous thromboembolism (12.1%, 7\/58) and hemorrhage (12.1%, 7\/58). Acute pancreatitis (8.6%, 5\/58) and hypersensitivity (2\/58, 3.4%) were less common. On univariate analysis, grade 3 liver injury was significantly associated with younger age groups (18-40 and 40-60 vs &#62;60 years; p=0.025), likely due to older age strongly correlating (p &#60;0.01) with receipt of &#60;2000IU\/m2 pegaspargase. No other toxicity was significantly associated with age. Hypofibrinogenemia and hepatotoxicity were significantly associated with initial receipt of pegaspargase during induction vs consolidation (p=0.042, p=0.013, respectively) but age was not. Pts receiving a max dose PEG of &#60;2000IU\/m2 had significantly lower odds of developing hepatotoxicity and hypertriglyceridemia than those receiving 2000 IU\/m2 or more (p=0.008, p=0.003, respectively). On multivariate analysis, higher max dose of PEG received (2000 IU\/m2 or over) correlated with greater odds of hepatotoxicity, hypertriglyceridemia and acute pancreatitis (OR 1.72, CI 1.23-2.38; OR 1.31, CI 2.18, CI 1.59-3.03; and OR 1.46, CI 1.13-1.88, respectively). Hypertriglyceridemia was also associated with older age and BMI &#62;30 (OR 1.31, CI 1.05-1.62, and OR 1.31, CI 1.09-1.59, respectively). In summary, low dose pegaspargase is a viable option in ALL in adults over 60, with only hypertriglyceridemia associated with older age. Future work might correlate serum pegaspargase activity to intolerance and outcomes, and examine whether prophylactic treatment e.g. with levocarnitine might prevent toxicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL05-01 Aging, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Toxicity,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yosef Joseph Rene Amel Riazat-Kesh<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hannah Levavi<sup>2<\/sup>, Sangeetha Venugopal<sup>3<\/sup>, Carli Beall<sup>4<\/sup>, Ronald Hoffman<sup>2<\/sup>, Marina Kremyanskaya<sup>2<\/sup>, John Mascarenhas<sup>2<\/sup>, Sara Kim<sup>5<\/sup>, Michal Bar-Natan<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Internal Medicine, Mt.

Although multiple studies have addressed this issue, it remains unclear if hypertension patients who are on antihypertensive medications are at higher risk for cancer.<br \/>Methods: Between 2013 and 2017, we enrolled 101,370 individuals with hypertension from community healthcare centers in Changning Shanghai, followed through December 31, 2019. Drug administration was defined as the class and number of ever use the major antihypertensives. The main outcomes included the incidences of all cancer and major types of cancer in Shanghai (lung, colorectum, thyroid, and stomach).<br \/>Results: During a mean follow-up of 5.1 (SD 1.3) years, 4970 cancer cases were newly diagnosed in the cohort. CCBs were the most frequently used antihypertensives which were associated with a moderately increased risk of all cancer (hazard ratio, HR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.05-1.18). The second commonly used drug ARBs were also associated with increased risk of all cancer (HR: 1.10, 95%CI: 1.03-1.17) as well as lung and thyroid cancers (HR: 1.21, 95%CI: 1.05-1.39; HR: 1.66, 95%CI: 1.22-2.27, respectively). No cancer association was found with other antihypertensives. Individuals who use more than one class of antihypertensives had a higher risk of all cancer, and a possible dose-response relationship was suggested.<br \/>Conclusions: Use of ARBs or CCBs may be associated with an increased risk of cancer. Taking more than one class of antihypertensives appeared to have a higher risk for cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Community-engaged research\/community-based participatory research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer prevention,Combination drug, Antihypertensive drugs,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Suna Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Li Xie<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ying Qian<sup>1<\/sup>, Jie Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Guanglu Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Lei Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Weituo Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Herbert Yu<sup>2<\/sup>, Wensui Zhao<sup>3<\/sup>, Biyun Qian<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>School of Public Health and Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Cancer Epidemiology Program, University of Hawaii Cancer Center, Honolulu, HI,<sup>3<\/sup>Shanghai Changning District Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"425fe525-21a3-412b-887a-11cac3428ca8","ControlNumber":"4052","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Non-cardia GAC is thought to occur via progression from <i>HP<\/i>-induced atrophic gastritis to gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM), dysplasia, and cancer. The purpose of this study was to enroll racially diverse (~50% self-identified as Black) patients from the endoscopy suite across the spectrum of <i>HP<\/i>-associated disease (gastritis, GIM, GAC) in a prospective observational cohort to biobank blood and tissue samples with patient-reported survey data and clinical history from the electronic health record.<br \/>Methods: In an ongoing prospective study funded by an NIH P20 disparities project, we enrolled a diverse, racially balanced cohort of research participants undergoing upper endoscopy. We tracked and optimized screening, enrollment, and collection of blood, tissue, and survey data. Organoids were generated from fresh and\/or cryopreserved biopsies of normal gastric tissue, gastritis, GIM, or GAC. Gene expression, immunohistochemistry and DNA mutational profiling were performed in a subset of organoids.<br \/>Results: To date, 563 patients were identified in screening (47% Black patients) and 250 were successfully included with a 44% enrollment rate (46% Black participants). Rates of successful sample and data collection were: 86% blood, 87% tissue collection, and 89% survey collection. The proportion of Black participants was greater in the <i>HP-<\/i>positive group (65%) vs. known<i> <\/i><i>HP-<\/i>negative (46%) (p=0.03).

Ongoing characterization of tumor organoids reflects expected heterogeneity among gastric cancer patients and provides a functional measure of cytokine expression.<br \/>Conclusions: To address health disparities related to gastric cancer, diverse patient cohorts must be established with successful biobanking from groups most affected by the disease. Patient-derived gastric organoids can be generated from diverse populations and across different clinical conditions as one approach to understanding and addressing gastric cancer health disparities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-01 Biobanking\/biospecimen collection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Organoids,Premalignancy,Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Priya Alagesan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Paula Scotland<sup>2<\/sup>, HannahSofia Brown<sup>1<\/sup>, Shannon  J.

As a result, many decline to participate. Adolescents have a much lower perception of risk compared to adults and are also susceptible to peer pressure and socialized trust or mistrust from their parents and family members, which can influence risk perception. As encouraging equitable participation in research becomes an important tool in the fight against cancer disparities, We Engage 4 Health created a graphic-style story &#8220;Research Ready&#8221; to help community members learn the 3 P&#8217;s: the purpose of cancer research, how they are kept safe while participating, and why people from diverse backgrounds are needed to participate. An accompanying Research Review Activity was also included to further support participants&#8217; decision-making regarding research participation. Two groups of diverse adolescents were asked to read the story aloud together in small groups and then discuss an active research study targeting adolescents using the review activity with a scientist to consider whether the first the teen story character (Vito) and ultimately themselves, should consider participation in the study and to identify what information was needed from study staff to better be able to make a decision based on their values and accurate information provided by study staff. Group 1 included 45 adolescents that were 68% African American and 10% European American. Group 2 included 73 high schoolers that were 78% Asian, 15% European American, and 5% African American. Post-discussion surveys indicated that only 9% and 3% in group 1 and group 2 respectively had previously participated in health research. However, after the story discussion, 83% and 89% indicated they thought it would be safe to participate in research and 76% and 89% indicated a willingness to participate in research in the future. Finally, 60% collectively enjoyed the story&#8217;s graphic-style format.

IVLBCL is a clonal proliferation with selective growth within the blood vessel. It has been primarily described in Asian and European populations, and a median age presentation is in the sixth to seventh decades without a sex predilection. The US incidence is 0.95 in 1 million, but is thought to be higher, as the diagnosis is mainly done postmortem. Meanwhile, the incidence rate of IVBCL in Hispanics (HI) remained unknown. This study looks at demographics, treatment patterns, and outcomes of patients with IVLBCL in the US, examining disparities by HI vs Non-Hispanic (NH).<br \/>Methods: Data were analyzed on IVLBCL patients reported to the SEER 18 database between 2000 and 2018. SEER 18 contains the most comprehensive population-based cancer information in the US, covering approximately 27% of the US population and 36% of HI alone. The racial groups analyzed were NH whites, HI whites, blacks, and Asians\/PIs (Pacific Islanders). Patient characteristics, age-adjusted incidence rate, and survival rate were compared across ethnic groups. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses compared overall survival (OS) between HI and NH. Multivariate analysis and propensity score matching were performed, with adjustment for age, stage and B-symptoms.<br \/>Results: We identified 164 patients with IVLBCL, of which 10% were HI. 41% of HI were male vs 44% of NH. HI were diagnosed at an older age, 72. vs 69 y.o., compared to NHI (p=0.907). Most of NH and HI were diagnosed between 60-80 y.o. (p=0.322), 53.1% and 47.1%, respectively. Regarding race, HI and NH were mainly identified as whites (88% vs 78%), followed by Asians (6% vs 17%) (p=0.013). For HI, 53% presented B symptoms compared to 16% of NH (p=&#60;0.001). On survival analysis, the survival probability at 2, 5 and 10 years of HI vs NH was (0.540 vs 0.505), (0.432 vs 0.425), and (0.443 vs 0.237), respectively. The median survival time was 0.8 years for HI and 1.9 years for NH. The 10 year OS probability was not significantly different for HI vs NH (p=0.66).On multivariate analysis, when adjusted for age, those patients who were 60 to 80 y.o. had worse OS compared to those younger than 60 y.o., with HR 1.4 (95% CI: 0.7 - 2.1).<br \/>Conclusion: In our study, despite a lower percentage of patients identified as Asian in our HI population, there is a significant difference in the presence of B-symptoms between HI and NH, going against the traditional description of an Asian variant with increased systemic symptoms. Despite this finding, it demonstrated similar outcomes in the 10 years survival analysis for HI and NH. Standardized treatment may explain why no variation was reported in OS. Our analysis shows that ethnic variations do not seem to affect oncological outcomes in IVLBCL for HI in the US.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Race,Hispanic,Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,B cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Daniela Urueta Portillo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Daniel Rosas<sup>1<\/sup>, Joel  E.

Despite Hispanics (HI) being 18.9% of the US population and the fastest-growing minority in the US, they only represent 4% of the patients enrolled in clinical trials. These disparities are often explained by different social determinants of health, but could also be due to decreased perceived interest by oncologists in their participation simply due to lack of English proficiency. Effective doctor-patient communication is vital in establishing a healthy doctor-patient relationship, and is vital in delivering high-quality health care. In this study, we explore whether physician-patient language concordance affects clinical trial enrollment.<br \/>Methods: We evaluated 233 patients diagnosed with breast cancer who consented to experimental clinical trials in a private Oncology practice in Houston, Texas, from 2008-2022. All trials had approved consent in English and Spanish. We used logistic regression to model the probability of treatment, while adjusting for the effects of cancer type, gender, race, ethnicity, and language concordance.<br \/>Results: Of the 233 patients with breast cancer, 191(82%) were enrolled in a clinical trial, and 96% of these patients spoke the same language as their providers. 42 patients were not enrolled, with 95% of patients speaking the same language as their provider. There were 209 (90%) patients who spoke English, 22 (9%) were Spanish speakers and 2 (1%) were Arabic speakers. Of the Spanish speakers, 18 were enrolled, with 13 (72%) having language concordance with their provider. The ethnicity was evaluated, resulting in 72 (31%) patients being Hispanics, 55 (24%) African American, 94 (40%) Caucasian, 7 (3%) Asian, 4 (2%) Middle Eastern and 1 (0.4%) American Indian. It also evaluated the rate of consent withdrawal, showing only 6 (3%) patients. After evaluating the results, it was noted that there was no statistically significant association of physician-patient language concordance with enrollment rate (p=0.776). There was also no significant difference in consent withdrawal (p=0.626), and no change associated with gender (p=0.344) or ethnicity when evaluated (p=0.13).<br \/>Conclusion: In conclusion, our analysis confirms no significant difference in breast cancer patients&#8217; enrollment in clinical trials if there is language concordance between physician and patient. The efforts of the medical workforce to use translators and translated versions of informed consents, surveys or outcome assessments, when available, seem enough for our patients to agree to continue enrollment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-04 Community outreach and patient accrual ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Race,Hispanic,Breast cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Daniela Urueta Portillo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ana  M.

However, physician and patient barriers limit participation of patients who are historically underrepresented in genomic studies and clinical trials [historically underrepresented patients (HUP)], thereby decreasing generalizability for those most negatively affected by cancer diagnosis. We interviewed patients to identify factors impacting genomic testing uptake and clinical trial enrollment.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> From 09\/2021 - 12\/2021 we interviewed 16 patients diagnosed with cancer seen at an ambulatory oncology center. Patients were HUP (Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, Hispanic\/Latinx, or older adult [70 years or older], or from a low-income zip code). From non-inclusive groups, patients identified as: 3 primarily spoke a language other than English, 9 Black, 3 other race, 6 Hispanic, and 3 aged 70 years or older. One-on-one interviews utilized a structured interview guide and lasted approximately 45 minutes. Participants were recruited until thematic saturation was reached then transcripts coded for major patterns and themes.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Regarding tumor genomic testing, many patients were unsure if they received testing or if testing was recommended (citing possible confusion with medical terminology or overwhelm with information). Cited barriers included education (not understanding the benefit of participating, investigational drug\/device identity, the procedures and processes involved), mistrust of research (specifically concerns over data privacy); and logistical accessibility (cost, time away from work, transportation). Those tested found it to be an easy process. Several cited that a patient advocate or social worker would be beneficial to navigate the process. Barriers around clinical trial enrollment included education (the risks of participating\/side effects, size of the study, investigational drug\/device identity), mistrust of research (data privacy, inclusion of HUP in trial, loss of autonomy in decision making), and logistical accessibility (time commitment). HUP who participated in a clinical trial appreciated the additional psychosocial support and clinical monitoring. Patients were emphatically interested in participating in genomic testing and cancer clinical trials when presented as the best course of care, though concerns about side effects from clinical trials persisted.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Patient barriers to tumor genomic testing and cancer clinical trials center around education, mistrust in research, and logistical accessibility.

Encouraging equitable participation in research becomes an important tool in the fight against cancer disparities. Therefore, we co-created with community representatives a graphic-style story entitled &#8220;Research Ready&#8221; that is used by trained Community Research Advocates (including some survivors or family of survivors themselves) to hold brief discussions to help eligible hesitant participants to learn the 3 P&#8217;s: the purpose of cancer research, how they are kept safe while participating, and why people from diverse backgrounds are needed to participate. Importantly, advocates use a Research Review activity to discuss factors that influence their willingness to participate as well as identify questions they have for the research study&#8217;s staff. Focus group and survey-based evaluation data show these discussions to be useful in increasing hesitant patients&#8217; willingness to consider participation in research and increase perception of safety. Advocates too appreciate the opportunity to serve. While this pilot is small, additional partnerships within the University of Cincinnati Cancer Center to expand the program will be developed. Future partnership with a community patient navigator program will also enable additional support and transportation to research appointments.

These constitute key resources for clinical and contemporary genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics studies. However, such specimens cannot be used for studies involving drug testing, high throughput target validation, and implementation for personalized medicine. Next-generation biobanking strategies rectify this issue by combining the collection of non-viable samples from patients with the propagation of viable tissue fractions as <i>in vitro<\/i> 2D and 3D cell models or <i>in vivo <\/i>xenograft models. Such cutting-edge biobanking strategies enable downstream cell-based high-throughput functional assays promoting the discovery of therapeutic targets or assessing treatment responses and resistance to treatment. Here, we provide comprehensive details of our establishment of a state-of-the-art<b> <\/b>biobanking platform for gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) samples (n=389). Our approach opens new directions for understanding disease biology and conducting translational cancer studies. Patient-derived 2D cells (n=376), organoids (PDOs) (n=185), and xenografts (PDXs) (n= 99) included in our pipeline retain crucial features of the original human tumors, serving as valuable tools for clinical and experimental analyses in the context of precision oncology. We also discuss the entire approach of next-generation biobanking and emphasize the importance of integrating the propagation of PDOs and PDXs simultaneously. In addition, we explain each protocol optimized to propagate patient tissue-derived cell models. We validate that these models recapitulate tissue heterogeneity and are relevant preclinical models.

Overcoming the complexity of this problem will require a larger, diverse, and dedicated workforce. Community engagement can lead to greater awareness of and both access and accrual to research. Encouraging trainees understanding of and participation in community engagement early on is one approach to curb cancer research related disparities. The current pipeline of cancer-focused healthcare professionals and researchers that understand, appropriately engage, and connect with their target communities and patient populations is dangerously inadequate. To expand our future culturally competent, cancer-focused workforce, the University of Cincinnati Cancer Center has established the Cancer Research Scholars Program which is supported in part by a National Cancer Institute R25. The program offers to 20-23 undergraduate scholars each year, unique and inspiring paid research opportunities across the cancer continuum and educational experiences that included cancer topics, professional development, team science, and both cultural humility and microaggression training. Importantly, all scholars prepare for and participate in one of three community-engaged, cancer-focused summer field experiences offered with our community partners to encourage the supporting of and\/\/or active participation in community-engaged research, education, and outreach in their future cancer careers. Twelve of the 23 summer 2022 Scholars were also invited to continue their research into the academic year either in-person or virtually. After year 1, Scholars and mentors completed surveys and on-camera interviews about the program highlighting the program&#8217;s successes as well as areas for improvement. Nearly all Scholars appreciated the community engagement opportunities offered and understood their value to their potential careers. Annual tracking of these Scholars will determine the program&#8217;s longer-term impact on the cancer workforce.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Melinda Butsch Kovacic<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Rachael  D.

Early palliative care (PC) is recommended for patients with stage IV LC. Research on PC and end of life care (EOLC) for Asian patients (AP) with stage IV LC in the US is limited. This retrospective study examines racial influences on PC and EOLC in patients with stage IV LC at an urban academic medical center serving a large proportion of AP.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Patients newly diagnosed with stage IV LC from 01\/01\/2014 to 12\/31\/2019 were identified from Tufts Medical Center cancer registry. Baseline demographics, disease characteristics, treatment history, PC and hospice use, and EOLC were compared between AP and White patients (WP) by Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-square\/Fisher's exact tests for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Time to palliative care (TTPC) in AP and WP was compared via log-rank test.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Of 89 AP and 197 WP (similar median age: 71 and 68 years old, respectively), AP had significantly more male representation (71.9% vs 48.2%), never-smokers (36.0% vs 7.1%), non-small cell histology (85.4% vs 72.6%), linguistic diversity (non-English languages: 6 vs 2), and interpreter use (43.8% vs 0.5%), with less preference for English (12% vs 99%). No difference in brain metastasis at diagnosis was noted. PC use was similar in AP and WP (38.2% vs 37.6%); relatively more first encounters occurred inpatient vs outpatient in both groups. Median TTPC tended to be longer in AP (15.7 vs 12.4 months, p=0.120). PC evaluation occurred within 12 months after diagnosis in 27 (30.3%) AP and 63 (32.0%) WP. Of those seen by PC, only 7 (20.6%) AP and 16 (21.3%) WP had more than one PC encounter. Of 22 AP and 74 WP with confirmed death, relatively more AP patients died in hospital (68.2% vs 32.4%, p=0.004), more often in ICU (40.9% vs 24.3%); no differences were found in use of mechanical ventilation (18.2% vs 16.2%) or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (0% vs 1.4%) preceding death. Within 6 months of death, outpatient oncologists and AP patients had fewer code status (0% vs 24.3%, p=0.010) but similar rates of health care proxy (18.2% vs 32.4%, p=0.110) and hospice care (18.2% vs 28.4%, p=0.411) discussions. Hospice enrollment (29.2% vs 32.0%, p=0.722), median time from entering hospice to death (16.5 vs 12.5 days, p=0.795) and from last systemic treatment to death (39 vs 55.5 days, p=0.844) were similar in AP and WP.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>PC utilization was similarly sub-optimal in AP and WP with newly diagnosed stage IV LC in this study, though TTPC tended to be longer in AP. While hospice utilization was also similar in AP and WP, AP had a higher rate of in-hospital death and fewer code status discussions with their outpatient oncologists in the 6 months preceding death. Whether these findings reflect racial disparities, cultural preferences, or other factors influencing PC and EOLC for AP with advanced LC warrants further study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Palliative care,Race,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xiao Hu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, John  W.

The aim of this study is to characterize changes in lung cancer clinical trial participation in Latin America before and after 2012.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> Clinical trials were identified in clinicaltrials.gov using the search terms &#8220;lung cancer,&#8221; country filters for 21 Latin American countries, and study start dates 01\/01\/2001-12\/31\/2011 and 01\/01\/2012-12\/31\/2021. Clinical trials were categorized as either originating in Latin America (LA) or outside Latin America with participation of Latin American countries (non-LA). The number of trials, trial phase, driver mutation studied, and types of intervention were collected for each country. Descriptive statistics and chi-square analysis with 95% confidence intervals were calculated.<br \/><b>Result: <\/b>Our analysis included 426 clinical trials involving Latin American countries, of which 74% (317\/426) were phase 3 trials. Only 6% (26\/426) of the trials from 2001-2021 were LA trials. Comparing the period 2001-2011 to 2012-2021, there was a marked increase in total clinical trials (101 v. 325, p&#60;0.001), predominantly due to an increase in non-LA trials (87 v. 313, p&#60;0.001). The number of LA trials was unchanged between the two periods (14 v. 12, p=0.69). There was an increase in the percentage of phase 3 trials (60% v. 79%, p&#60;0.001) between the two periods. There was also an 83% increase in studies for patients with specific driver mutations (EGFR, KRAS, ALK, and RET) (53 v. 97, p&#60;0.001). The countries with the highest rates of open clinical trials were Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. In all three countries, the total number of clinical trials increased between the period 2001-2011 and 2012-2021: Mexico (40 v. 88, p&#60;0.001, 120% increase), Brazil (61 v. 108, p=0.003, 77% increase), and Argentina (50 v. 78, p=0.013, 56% increase).<br \/><b>Conclusion <\/b>Overall, there was a significant (&#62;3-fold) increase in clinical trial participation by Latin American countries, specifically in non-LA trials, from 2012-2021.

Due to unique barriers facing Native Americans (NA) patients, this underrepresented population has worse outcomes and increased mortality. In Oregon, NAs have nearly double the PDAC incidence rate compared to the general US population. Oregon Health &#38; Science University (OHSU) is a leader in PDAC care and research, yet NAs remain underrepresented in pancreatic cancer research at OHSU, and across the country. This highlights the need for a focused and comprehensive research program that collaborates with local tribal communities to identify specific issues and barriers that can be addressed to improve patient care in the NA population. We hypothesize that if we establish a workflow that strengthens existing relationships with tribal communities and leverages established OHSU infrastructure and expertise, we can directly address the unmet need of understanding, preventing and treating PDAC for NA individuals in our local communities. This includes increasing enrollment of NAs in PDAC clinical trials and developing a genetic registry that could help both depict genetic underpinnings that predispose NA individuals to PDAC and potentially guide therapeutic approaches. To build trust within NA communities, we initiated collaborations with Oregon tribes to develop culturally appropriate programs guided by NA community members. Through OHSU&#8217;s Northwest Native American Center of Excellence, we developed a close relationship with the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs. Together with our institution&#8217;s Community Outreach, Research, and Engagement (CORE) team, we are working with the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs to better understand provider and NA community member attitudes towards and barriers to clinical trial participation. We will incorporate these perceptions into a tribe-specific program that describes the multi-faceted facilitators and barriers that inform decision-making. Moreover, we are implementing a patient navigator program to help NA patients overcome clinical trial barriers by providing culturally appropriate patient education, reimbursement for travel-associated expenses, local administration of chemotherapy, and telehealth capabilities. Future work includes co-implementing strategies for tribes to review incoming research requests with the goal of implementing a system to promote awareness and enrollment of NAs in PDAC clinical research. This system will be then be utilized to establish the first NA PDAC tissue registry to identifying gene-environment interactions and unique genetic alterations that may predispose NA individuals to PDAC. Overall, this collaborative work will create a roadmap for engagement and a conscientious process to provide awareness and the best in class treatment for NA individuals with PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Community-engaged research\/community-based participatory research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Native American,Community Engagement,Disparities,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Claymore Kills First<sup><\/sup>, <b>Grace  A.

Black\/African American (AA) patients with TNBC have the highest mortality rate and the shortest survival of any racial\/ethnic group in the United States. TNBC challenges our ability to personalize effective therapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is the standard-of-care (SOC) to treat T2 or LN+ TNBC. The addition of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized treatment for these high-risk patients. Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is the new SOC for neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) in TNBC. Pathologic complete response (pCR) is a reliable indicator that correlates with improved long-term survival. However, clinical uncertainties remain in those who have an incomplete pathologic response (pIR) since many similarly treated TNBC patients with identical stage and comparable residual cancer burden (RCB) demonstrate disparate clinical outcomes. Current methods fall short in predicting tumor recurrence and treatment resistance in the clinic.<br \/>Supported by ample evidence in developmental, evolutionary, and cancer biology, we proposed that EGFR-K-RAS-SIAH pathway activation is a major driving force in TNBC and that its most downstream gatekeeper, SIAH, is a tumor-specific, therapy-responsive, and prognostic biomarker for patient risk stratification in TNBC. The persistent high expression of SIAH<sup> <\/sup>in residual tumors after neoadjuvant therapy reflects EGFR\/K-RAS pathway activation (ON) and resistance to treatment. The loss of expression of SIAH in residual tumors reflects EGFR\/K-RAS pathway inactivation (OFF) and response to treatment (i.e. treatment efficacy). Here we propose to establish the power of SIAH as a prognostic biomarker to differentiate high-risk from low-risk tumors and predict &#8220;real-time&#8221; therapy response, in both pre- and post-neoadjuvant (NACT\/NST) setting.<br \/>Breast cancer mortality rates in Hampton Roads<b> <\/b>Virginia and Richmond Virginia are among the worst in the U.S. and demonstrate a major cancer health disparity. Black patients in our region have a 60-70% higher mortality rate than white patients according to CDC\/SEER databases. Using a large cohort of 525 racially diverse TNBC patients (246 black and 279 white patients) at Sentara Cancer Network, we conducted Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and detected a major racial disparity, with significantly lower survival among the Black\/AA TNBC cohort, compared to national databases. We will expand this TNBC disparity study by using 2 large racially-diverse cohorts of 981 TNBC patients (459 Black and 493 white patients) from the Sentara Cancer Network and VCU Massey Cancer Center to analyze the prognosis of SIAH expression. By focusing on this tumor-driving EGFR-K-RAS-SIAH pathway, we aim to delineate the underlying molecular basis of treatment resistance and racial disparity in high-risk TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prognostic markers,Multidrug resistance,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Amy  H.

African Americans and Hispanic\/Latinos account for 13% and 18% of the US population, respectively, but in 2018 these groups combined were only 8% of oncology trial subjects. Disproportionate enrollment can limit how generalizable trial outcomes may be and can perpetuate healthcare disparities. The majority of clinical trial enrollment occurs at large academic cancer centers that may not reflect the diverse general cancer patient population in the US. Los Angeles County\/University of Southern California Medical Center (LAC+USC) is a large safety net hospital that serves a racially and ethnically diverse patient population.<br \/>Methods: We developed a database of all adult patients (pts) enrolled in phase I solid tumor trials at LAC+USC from 2015 - 2022. The data collected includes baseline demographics (age, gender, race, ethnicity, primary language, tumor histology), type of therapeutic intervention, radiologic response per RECIST 1.1, duration of treatment, and survival. Progression-free survival was defined as time from enrollment in the study until progression, discontinuation of treatment, or death. Disease control rate (DCR) was defined as pts with best response of CR, PR, or SD.<br \/>Results: 120 pts with solid tumors were enrolled in phase 1 trials at LAC+USC from 2015-2022. Median age was 58 (range 26-78); 58% female; ECOG 0-1 (99%), 2 (1%). 73 patients (61%) were Hispanic, 27 (23%) Asian\/Pacific Islander, 9 (8%) non-Hispanic (NH) White, 5 (4%) were NH Black, and 6 (5%) were unknown. 70% of pts had a primary language other than English: 56% Spanish. The most common tumor types were colorectal (16%), hepatocellular (13%), non-small cell lung (12%), head and neck (11%), and ovarian (11%). Trial interventions included chemotherapy (19%), immunotherapy (35%), targeted therapy (54%), and 10% required biomarker selection. The disease control rate (DCR) was 58\/120 (48%): 2 pts had CR, 9 pts had PR, and 47 pts had SD. 4-month progression-free survival (PFS) was 42\/120 (35%), and 6-month PFS was 27\/120 (23%). 90-day survival was confirmed in 101\/120 (84%) of patients.<br \/>Discussion: A racially diverse population can be successfully enrolled in early phase oncology trials at a safety net hospital. Patient populations that are underrepresented nationally in clinical trials had robust enrollment and comprised the majority of participation (88%) in this setting. Almost half of patients derived clinical benefit (48% DCR) from trial participation. Creating an infrastructure to enroll patients to phase 1 clinical trials at a safety net hospital may be a successful strategy to improve racial and ethnic diversity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-04 Community outreach and patient accrual ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Phase I,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Varun Roy<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Esther Lee<sup>2<\/sup>, Ming Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiomara Menendez<sup>1<\/sup>, Elena Nieves<sup>1<\/sup>, Rebecca Umayam<sup>1<\/sup>, Nicole Jensen<sup>1<\/sup>, Lorraine Martinez<sup>1<\/sup>, Diana Hanna<sup>1<\/sup>, Jorge Nieva<sup>1<\/sup>, Anthony El-Khoueiry<sup>1<\/sup>, Jacob Thomas<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington DC, DC","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"883bc033-2e3c-4687-8632-d555ec501da8","ControlNumber":"3689","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>V.

Cultural competency recognizes the importance for organizations of participants&#8217; diverse social and cultural values, beliefs, and behaviors, and has gained attention because it can bridge health perspectives, understanding, and respect between health professionals and patients. There remains a need for cultural competency in healthcare as disparities persist across the U.S. in racial and ethnic minority groups who experience worse health outcomes and lower healthcare quality than the general public. Therefore, a cultural competency training curriculum was created using various resources to improve interactions between Pacific Islander patients and healthcare professionals. This training helps to reduce racial\/ethnic disparities in healthcare by encouraging mutual understanding and improving patient satisfaction, adherence to medical instructions, and overall health outcomes by highlighting patient-centered care as a result of utilizing components of cultural competency. To improve patient experiences in Hawai&#8217;i, healthcare professionals need the tools to better interact with patients from different cultures, such as Pacific Islanders. This training provides healthcare professionals with culturally-based content for improving cultural competence techniques for interacting with Pacific Island patients. This training was pilot tested with key stakeholders from community organizations and Cancer Center faculty\/staff. Local health clinics, providers, and practices will have the opportunity to participate in this training through a Zoom-based electronic training format and be provided with three continuing medical education credits. The initial delivery of the training was intended for in-person sessions; however, a virtual format was adapted due to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent social distancing regulations. Healthcare providers are provided pre-training resources, a pre- and post-test, and a course evaluation to determine the validity of training objectives. To date, two Federally Qualified Health Centers have been provided the training , n=60<i>, <\/i>as well as one Cancer Health Equity Partnerships&#8217; Scientific Workshop, n=40. For attendees, the analysis of correct responses from the pretest to post-test showed a significant improvement on 6 of the 12 questions. Respondents also agreed that the training resources aligned with the course objectives. Improved patient interactions from this training can help support better patient outcomes, adherence to medical advice regarding cancer screenings, and many other aspects of improving health equity for Pacific Islanders.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Community-engaged research\/community-based participatory research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prevention,Race,Education,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mark Lee Willingham Jr.<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kevin Cassel<sup>2<\/sup>, Angela Sy<sup>3<\/sup>, Munirih Taafaki<sup>4<\/sup>, Tressa P.

However, representation of Black individuals in biospecimen cancer research remains low and requires being asked to engage in research. We sought to understand the experiences, beliefs, and knowledge about biospecimen research among Black patients with lung cancer.<br \/>Methods: Semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 15 Black patients diagnosed with lung cancer were conducted between January and August 2022 at a large academic center in North Carolina. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis.<br \/>Results: Themes related to who should initiate discussions about biospecimen donation, what should be considered before donation, and communication strategies to increase participation of Black patients with cancer in biospecimen research emerged from the interviews. Most participants indicated that discussions about biospecimen donation should be initiated by trusted and knowledgeable members of the medical team and most expressed trusting their providers. Some also expressed the importance of including family members in discussions about medical and research decisions. Some participants felt it was important to consider if donating specimens would cause pain or would require additional procedures. Recommended communication strategies to facilitate participation included use of simple and easily understood language in addition to messaging related to how biospecimen donation would benefit others. Participants also felt cultural humility, respect, and empathy during research recruitment would help enhance enrollment of Black participants in biospecimen research. Of note, all participants reported never being asked to participate in biospecimen research and felt that underrepresentation of Black participants may be due to not being asked.<br \/>Conclusion: Black participants in this study have not been asked to participate in biospecimen research but are willing to be engaged in conversations about research from their medical team. Simply being asked, trusting their medical provider, cultural humility, and framing the message on how the research will benefit others are some of the recommended strategies to enhance research participation among Black patients.

While ERBB2 amplification has been considered as a critical biomarker to predict the efficacy and safety of anti-ERBB2 therapy of CRC, its point mutation status is largely ambiguous.<b>Methods: <\/b>Blood or tissues samples from 2454 Chinese patients with CRC were collected, and the genomic landscape, clinical characteristics and genetic features of ERBB2 in these samples were retrospectively investigated using next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. <b>Results:<\/b> Of the 2454 colorectal cancer patients, 3.46% (85) carried ERBB2 amplification, 2.24% (55) carried ERBB2 mutation, and some patients harbored both ERBB2 amplification and point mutation at the same time. Microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) was found in approximately 32.7% (18\/55) of patients with ERBB2-mutated CRC, but almost negative in ERBB2-amplified CRC. The median fold change of ERBB2 amplification was 30 (Range 4 to 245). Among the 16 mutation sites detected from 55 patients with ERBB2 point mutations, p.R678Q was the most common mutation site (28%), followed by p.V842I (24%) and p.S310F\/Y (12%), which appeared to be slightly different from previous reports. ERBB2<br \/>mutation was more frequently found in CRC patients aged &#60; 50 years. 50.9% of CRC patients with wild-type ERBB2 carried KRAS mutation, which was significantly higher than those with mutated ERBB2 (25.6%). A higher incidence of BRAF mutation was observed in patients with mutated-ERBB2 (8.5% vs. 2.3%). In addition, CRC patients with ERBB2 CNV showed a higher prevalence of TP53 mutation comparing with those with ERBB2 SNV (92.3% vs. 58.3%), while KRAS mutation exhibited a contrary trend (14.1% vs. 45.8%)<b>Conclusions: <\/b>The overall variation rate of ERBB2 is 5.4% in Chinese patients with CRC, which is accompanied by significantly different molecular pathological characteristics compared to patients with wild-type ERBB2, and different mutation types (CNV or SNV) display different molecular pathological characteristics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HER2,Mutations,Amplification,Colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Zhiqin Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Shijun Yu<sup>1<\/sup>, Yin Wu<sup>1<\/sup>, Bei Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Ding Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Yong Gao<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Ming Quan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Oncology, Shanghai East Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>The Medical Department, 3D Medicines Inc, Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b3ed6acf-7872-4103-a094-e3b9007d2fa5","ControlNumber":"2819","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Z.

Gleason score, the presence or absence of visceral metastases, and the number of bone metastases, which were used in the LATITUDE and CHAARTED trials, are known prognostic factors for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC). Although a large proportion of patients with mCSPC are elderly, the significance of sarcopenia in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer is unknown.<br \/>Patients and Methods: Of 193 patients with mCSPC treated at Kanazawa University Hospital between 2000 and 2019, 150 patients with confirmed CT at diagnosis were included. Sarcopenia was determined based on the definition of Martin et al. Overall survival and prognostic factors were retrospectively evaluated.<br \/>Results: The median age was 72 years, median PSA 241 ng\/mL, Gleason score (GS) &#8805; 9 in 91 patients, visceral metastases in 23 patients, and sarcopenia in 106 patients. 109 patients (72.7%) were diagnosed as high risk by Latitude risk classification and 105 patients (70%) were diagnosed as high volume by Charted risk classification. All cause death was 64 patients, and the median follow-up period was 38.2 months. The median overall survival was 69.6 months. On multivariate analysis, GS &#8805;9 (P &#60;0.0001, hazard risk =3.78), LDH &#8805; 300 U\/L (P &#60;0.0001, hazard risk =2.88), and sarcopenia (P=0.04, hazard risk=2.07) were significant independent poor prognostic factors predicting shorter OS. The prognosis could be significantly stratified into a high risk group if two or more of these three factors were met and a low risk group if one or less was met (44 months vs. 106.4 months, P=0.0001, hazard risk=2.91). This classification more clearly stratified prognosis than the LATITUD classification (55.1 months vs. 135 months, P =0.027, hazard risk =1.8) or the CHAARTED trial classification (52.9 months vs. 135 months, P =0.009, hazard risk =1.98).<br \/>Conclusion: Sarcopenia that can assess general status was considered useful in the prognostic evaluation of patients with mCSPC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL05-02 Other ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Metastasis,Prognostic factors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hiroaki Iwamoto<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kouji Izumi<sup><\/sup>, Atsushi Mizokami<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Department of Integrative Cancer Therapy and Urology, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Science, Kanazawa, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b1647b7b-e882-499b-9c3c-e44d1d37f940","ControlNumber":"240","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

Demographics, existing medical conditions, and lab values were obtained from the Electronic Health Record, whereas history of cancer and metastatic disease at diagnosis were obtained from the Cancer Registry. Prevalence of medical conditions and abnormal lab values were reported among all patients and compared by race groups (White, Black, Hispanic, and other races) using age-adjusted logistic regression. For factors with prevalence higher than 5%, stratified analysis was conducted with respect to cancer type and adjusted for multiple comparisons.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Compared to White patients, Black (B) and Hispanic (H) patients were found to have higher prevalence of diabetes (OR [odds ratio] = 2.26 [B]\/1.40 [H]), organ transplantation (OR=1.58 [B]\/1.77 [H]), hepatitis (OR=1.74 [B]\/1.48 [H]), HIV (OR=4.25 [B]\/1.92 [H]), and abnormal creatinine value (OR=1.77 [B]\/1.23 [H]).

In 2014, a Mayo Clinic study of uninsured, low-income, working, Volunteer in Medicine (VIM) Clinic patients in Jacksonville, Florida found a statistically significant lower awareness of HPV (50.3% vs 63.6%) and the HPV vaccine (32.1% vs 62.7%) than the national population. As a result, our team collaborated with Merck to develop a free HPV vaccination program and video education campaign for VIM patients.<br \/>Methods: We assessed VIM patients HPV vaccination knowledge, awareness, and prevalence of hesitancy towards receiving the vaccine. VIM patients (ages 18-45) with no previous history of HPV vaccination were invited to participate in this study. The Parents Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines (PACV) survey was used to evaluate vaccine hesitancy. Patients who declined the HPV vaccine were shown an educational video to assess effectiveness in persuading patients&#8217; opinion. Each participant received a vaccine hesitancy PACV score, which was compared with their vaccine disposition. Mayo Clinic IRB approval of the study was obtained.<br \/>Results: Our analysis included 43 patients (34 females, 9 males) with a median age of 40 (age range 27- 45). Patients had overall knowledge of HPV of 88.4%, with 69.8% having heard of the HPV vaccine. 85.7% PACV survey respondents were deemed non-hesitant (PACV scores 0-49), and 80.6% of the non-hesitant subset (29\/36) agreed to undergo vaccination. The average PACV score of vaccine-interested participants was lower (25.2) than the average of participants not interested in the vaccine (36.7). Black participants had a statistically significant higher PACV score than White participants. The PACV scores of individuals who were already familiar with the HPV vaccine were significantly lower than those of participants who were unfamiliar with the HPV vaccine. Only 20% (2\/10) of individuals, who had previously declined vaccination, agreed to receive the HPV vaccine after viewing the HPV educational video. Of the 33 participants who agreed to receive the free HPV vaccine, only 9 (27.3%) completed all three doses.<br \/>Conclusions: HPV vaccine awareness and knowledge at VIM increased compared to the 2014 cohort. Vaccine hesitancy was not observed in most patients, yet video education was effective in only a small portion of patients with vaccine hesitancy. Additionally, a minority of patients who agreed to receive the free HPV vaccine series completed all three doses. Our results suggests that free HPV vaccination and video education is not sufficient to achieve adequate vaccination rates among low-income uninsured young adults, nor overcoming vaccine hesitancy. Innovative measures are warranted to improve vaccination rates in this population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Community-engaged research\/community-based participatory research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Human papillomavirus (HPV),Vaccines,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hiram Diaz<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Gerardo Colon-Otero<sup>2<\/sup>, Laura  M.

These caregivers describe feeling unsupported and unprepared to assume the responsibilities associated with addressing the progressive physical, emotional, and psychological support needs of their loved ones with GBM. In this qualitative study, female spouse primary caregivers were recruited through a private Facebook support group to write letters describing their experiences in caring for their loved ones with GBM. Using a reflexive thematic analysis, 101 letters from caregivers were analyzed for unmet needs, challenges, and opportunities for better care and support. Caregivers expressed feeling unsupported and poorly prepared, and described different levels and types of needs and challenges throughout the GBM disease trajectory. The 4 phases of the trajectory included the acute phase (first 2-4 months post diagnosis), living with disease progression, end of life stage, and the bereavement stage. Challenges included difficulties adapting to sudden life changes, the need for more education on what to expect, feelings of sudden loss, relationship strain, and not having enough knowledge about GBM. Associated emotional responses included feelings of fear, lack of control, agony, disappointment, and exhaustion. These challenges and emotional impact were greatest during the acute and living with disease progression phases. Caregivers also described relying heavily on friends, community supports (such as faith groups), peer-support through the Facebook group during this living with disease progression phase, but still experienced high levels of relationship strain and other unmet needs. These findings on the primary caregivers&#8217; experiences provide opportunities to guide more timely and tailored interventions to provide support and improve care for patient\/caregiver dyads to help mitigate the burden of this progressive disease and improve quality of life for caregivers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL06-03 Community-engaged research\/community-based participatory research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,Human,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Diana  L.
