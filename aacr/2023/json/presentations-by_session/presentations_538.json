In BAF complexes, The BRG1 (SMARCA4) or BRM (SMARCA2) is the core ATPase. AML stem\/progenitor cells (LSCs) express and are dependent on BRG1\/BRM activity to maintain their dysregulated epigenome\/transcriptome, especially driven by mutations in epigenetic regulators and TFs. CRISPR-dependency DepMap also shows dependency on SMARCA4 in numerous AML cell lines. FHD-286 is a selective, oral inhibitor of BRG1\/BRM in early clinical development as a therapy for AML. Our present studies demonstrate that exposure to FHD-286 (10 to 100 nM) for 7 days induces differentiation followed by loss of viability of AML cell lines and PD AML cells with MLL rearrangement (r), mutant (mt) NPM1 and chromosome 3q26 lesions (with EVI1 overexpression). Treatment with FHD-286 caused whole-genome, concordant, up- or down-regulations in ATAC-Seq peaks and RNA-Seq-determined mRNA expressions of specific loci, associated with significant reduction in the gene-sets of targets of MYC, mTORC1, E2F, Interferon-gamma, IL6-JAK-STAT3, as well as of inflammatory response and oxidative phosphorylation genes. QPCR analyses determined significant reduction in mRNA expression of MYC, SPI1 and BCL2 genes. Mass spectrometry on AML cell lysates treated with FHD-286 showed log2 fold-reductions in c-Myc, SPI1, MEF2C, KMT2C and CDK4 (in MOLM13) and in EVI1, c-Myb, CDK6 and c-Myc (in AML191) cells. Co-treatment with FHD-286 and venetoclax, decitabine or BET inhibitor (OTX015) exerted synergistic in vitro lethality against AML cell lines and PD AML cells, especially those expressing MLL-r, mtNPM1 or EVI1 (Delta synergy scores &#62; 5 by the ZIP method). Based on the known efficacy of the Menin inhibitor SNDX-50469, we also found that co-treatment with FHD-286 and SNDX-50469 was synergistically lethal against AML cell lines and PD AML cells with MLL-r or mtNPM1. Finally, in a luciferase-transduced, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of AML cells with MLL-AF9, FLT3, KMT2C\/2D and NOTCH2 mutations, we determined that treatment with FHD-286 administered orally alone for 4 to 6 weeks was significantly effective in reducing AML burden and improving overall survival of the mice. Additionally, co-treatment with FHD-286 and venetoclax, decitabine or OTX015, as compared to each drug alone or vehicle control, significantly reduced AML burden and improved the overall survival of the NSG mice, without inducing significant toxicity. Taken together, these findings highlight the promise of FHD-286 treatment alone and in rational combinations in exerting significant anti-AML efficacy against cellular models of AML, especially those with MLL-r, mtNPM1 or chromosome 3q26 lesions and EVI1 overexpression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Small molecule inhibitor,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Warren C.

Their aggressive phenotype results from a single recurring biallelic loss-of-function mutation in genes encoding components of the SWI\/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex - <i>SMARCB1<\/i> in the majority of tumors and <i>SMARCA4<\/i> in remaining tumors. Residual SWI\/SNF activity continues to inhibit EZH2 methyltransferase except at gene promoter regions where EZH2 co-localizes with the REST complex. At these sites, EZH2 increases repressive H3K27me3 marks. EZH2 co-localizes with REST on neuronal differentiation and tumor suppressor genes. As a result, this epigenetic abnormality helps maintain AT\/RT in a stem cell-like state, driving its aggressive growth and therapy resistance. We study the consequences of disrupting SWI\/SNF inhibition at sites of EZH2\/REST co-localization to target AT\/RT precisely. While there are no known interactions between the REST complex and SWI\/SNF, there are interactions between REST&#8217;s primary co-factor CoREST and SWI\/SNF. The CoREST complex consists of LSD1, HDAC1, and the scaffolding protein RCOR. We disrupted the CoREST complex with lentiviral knockdown of RCOR2 (kdRCOR2). KdRCOR2 reversed AT\/RT&#8217;s stem cell-like state, driving neuronal differentiation and slowing AT\/RT growth. Interestingly, kdRCOR1 had no impact on cell differentiation (microscopy and qRT-PCR) and had a modest impact on cell growth (MUSE cell viability assay). We next used Corin to pharmacologically target the CoREST complex in 3 AT\/RT cell lines (CHLA05, CHLA06, and BT37). Corin is a bi-functional inhibitor of LSD1 and HDAC1\/2, the component enzymes of the CoREST complex. Similar to kdRCOR2, Corin induced neuronal differentiation in AT\/RT with increased adherence to plastic and new axonal development (microscopy). Cells also increased expression of neuronal differentiation markers identified by immunofluorescence (MAP2) and qRT-PCR (CEND1, and NEUROD2, t-test p&#60;0.05), and decreased expression of stem cell markers (western blot SOX2 and LIN28). In addition, Corin reduced AT\/RT cell viability and proliferation (MUSE Cell viability assay p&#60;0.05; MUSE BrdU assay p&#60;0.05) and increased apoptosis (MUSE Annexin V assay, p&#60;0.05). In mice bearing orthotopic CHLA06 tumors, convection-enhanced delivery of a single dose of Corin increased H3K27me3 and H3K27ac, demonstrating that Corin engaged its target <i>in vivo<\/i> and induced apoptosis (western blot, PARP). These studies demonstrate that targeting the CoREST complex disrupts AT\/RT epigenetic abnormalities, reversing their stem cell-like state, slowing tumor cell growth, and inducing apoptosis. Targeting the CoREST complex with Corin is a promising new strategy that may translate into the clinical setting to help improve AT\/RT&#8217;s dismal survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-02 Epigenetic targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumors,CoREST complex,Differentiation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anupa Geethadevi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Marianne Collard<sup>2<\/sup>, Nikhil Vaidya<sup>2<\/sup>, Tyler Findlay<sup>1<\/sup>, Kristen Malebranche<sup>1<\/sup>, Charles Eberhart<sup>3<\/sup>, Eric Raabe<sup>1<\/sup>, Philip Cole<sup>4<\/sup>, Rhoda Alani<sup>2<\/sup>, Jeffrey Rubens<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Pediatric Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD,<sup>2<\/sup>Dermatology, Boston University, Boston, MA,<sup>3<\/sup>Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD,<sup>4<\/sup>Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a64c3940-99f2-45bd-aad0-6821c1c2069d","ControlNumber":"3484","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

The most clinically advanced of these first-generation molecules have demonstrated clinical response rates of 30-45% and approximately 6-month progression-free survival in lung cancer patients. While significant, a majority of patients fail to achieve a clinical response and acquired resistance is common. Resistance to first-generation inhibitors can be driven by upregulation of the activated (GTP-bound) form of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>, which remains an undrugged form of the oncoprotein. Here we report the discovery of FMC-376, a novel inhibitor of the activated, GTP-bound, form of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>, which also potently inhibits the inactive, (GDP-bound), form of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>. FMC-376 was discovered through the Frontier<sup>TM <\/sup>platform, which integrates chemoproteomics, machine-learning, and covalent fragment-based drug discovery. FMC-376 binds KRAS in the switch II pocket, rapidly forming a covalent bond with cysteine 12 in the presence of either GDP or GTP. X-ray crystallography demonstrated that Cys12 adopts a novel confirmation in forming a covalent bond with FMC-376. This results in potent inhibition of RAF1 and PI3K&#945; effector interactions (IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 0.007 &#956;M for both respectively at 2 h) in contrast to sotorasib or adagrasib (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#62; 50 and ~ 5 &#956;M respectively). FMC-376 treatment results in potent anti-tumor activity across a panel of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutant tumor cell lines, sparing non- KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> cell lines. To model resistance mediated by activated KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>, a mutation that abrogates GTPase activity (A59G) was introduced into KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>. This upregulation of GTP-bound KRAS<sup>G12C <\/sup>drives significant (&#62;10-fold) resistance to both adagrasib and sotorasib in tumor cell viability assays whereas FMC-376 remains equipotent in settings where GTP-bound KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> is upregulated. Evaluation of FMC-376 in models where EGFR signaling (a suspected mechanism of clinical resistance) is induced demonstrated rapid and durable target engagement in contrast to both sotorasib and adagrasib which show decreased effectiveness after EGF stimulation. Further evaluation of FMC-376 <i>in vivo<\/i> has demonstrated rapid and durable KRAS<sup>G12C <\/sup>target occupancy (&#62;90%) and pathway inhibition in tumors, resulting in regression of CDX\/PDX tumor models. FMC-376, an inhibitor of both active and inactive forms of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>,<sup> <\/sup>provides a differentiated mechanism of action with the potential for broader and more durable response in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Colon cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Snahel Patel<sup>1<\/sup>, Barun Bhhatarai<sup>2<\/sup>, Philamer Calses<sup>1<\/sup>, Daniel Erlanson<sup>1<\/sup>, Robert Everley<sup>2<\/sup>, Susan Fong<sup>1<\/sup>, Phil Gerken<sup>1<\/sup>, Johannes  C.

However, many patients become resistant to CDK4\/6 therapy due to various mechanisms such as loss of tumor suppressor Rb, hyperactivation of CDK4\/6, and\/or CDK2\/Cyclin E1 expression and activity, resulting in a highly unmet clinical need. Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), owing to a lack of hormone receptor (HR) expression and extensive heterogeneity, remain notoriously aggressive and unresponsive to current therapies. <i>CCNE1<\/i> overexpression or amplification has been shown to be an oncogenic driver associated with poor clinical outcomes in ovarian, gastric, endometrial, and HR<sup>+<\/sup> breast cancers. CCNE1<sup>hi <\/sup>cancers are dependent on CDK2 for growth and survival. CDK2 in complex with CCNE1 phosphorylates Rb, resulting in E2F target gene expression and G1 to S-phase cell cycle progression. Using a potent and selective CDK2 inhibitor, INCB123667, we demonstrate the efficacy of CDK2 inhibition in CCNE1<sup>hi<\/sup> breast cancer models. Analysis of genome-wide CRISPR screen data identified a subset of CCNE1<sup>hi<\/sup> breast cancer models dependent on CDK2 comprised of basal and luminal breast cancer subtypes, including TNBC, ER<sup>+<\/sup> HER2<sup>&#8722;<\/sup>, and HR<sup>&#8722;<\/sup> HER2<sup>+<\/sup> models. Two CCNE1<sup>hi<\/sup> cell lines, HCC1569 and MDAMB157, were evaluated in cell assays monitoring pRb, S-phase, and growth inhibition, and found to be sensitive to treatment with INCB123667 and insensitive to multiple CDK4\/6 inhibitors. Through extensive biochemical studies, INCB123667 was observed to be potently active against CDK2 at subnanomolar range and inactive against other CDKs (CDK1, CDK4, CDK6, CDK7, and CDK9). INCB123667 also selectively induced senescence in CCNE1<sup>hi<\/sup> HCC1569 cells. In contrast, CCNE1 nonamplified cell lines, MCF7 and T47D, were inactive in pRb, S-phase, and growth inhibition assays when treated with INCB123667. Significant tumor growth inhibition was observed in CCNE1<sup>hi<\/sup> PDX and xenograft models with minimal body weight loss. We also observed dose-dependent inhibition of CDK2 substrates, including pRb S780, both in vitro<i> <\/i>and in vivo. To further characterize downstream signaling and transcriptional changes with CDK2 inhibition, we identified a discrete gene signature associated with cell cycle regulation, which was notably distinct from CDK4\/6 responsive target genes. In conclusion, we have demonstrated CDK2 activity in CCNE1<sup>hi<\/sup> breast cancers using INCB123667, a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of CDK2 currently in clinical development. Treatment resulted in cell growth inhibition and antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Our data demonstrate the therapeutic potential of CDK2 inhibition in CCNE1<sup>hi<\/sup> HR<sup>+<\/sup> HER2<sup>&#8722;<\/sup> and TNBC breast cancer models.<br \/>Acknowledgments: R&#38;D services provided by Pharmaron, Crown Bioscience, and Champions Oncology","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK,CDK4\/6 resistance,Cyclin E,INCB123667,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Saswati Chand<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Michael Hansbury<sup><\/sup>, Yvonne Lo<sup><\/sup>, Pat Feldman<sup><\/sup>, Justine Carl<sup><\/sup>, Cynthia Timmers<sup><\/sup>, Joshua Hummel<sup><\/sup>, Susan Wee<sup><\/sup>, Sunkyu Kim<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Incyte Research Institute, Wilmington, DE","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f7f4ef34-673a-4347-8588-a289211550e1","ControlNumber":"3059","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

We explored whether the presence of specific mutations and dynamic changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) would be of prognostic\/predictive value for patients (pts) with <i>KRAS<\/i> G12C mutations on sotorasib.<br \/>Methods: Serial plasma was collected from pts with advanced <i>KRAS<\/i> G12C mutant NSCLC treated on the registrational CodeBreaK 100 trial, including at baseline (cycle 1, day 1, C1D1), cycle 2, day 1 (C2D1), and at end of treatment (EOT). At one site (Memorial Sloan Kettering), plasma was collected at additional timepoints, including C1D2 and C1D8. Plasma was analyzed using the Resolution Bioscience ctDX Lung<sup>TM<\/sup> assay, a 23-gene panel.<br \/>Results: Plasma was collected from 179 pts, for a total of 624 evaluable samples. At baseline, 77% of pts (129\/168) had detectable plasma <i>KRAS<\/i> G12C mutations. Lower G12C allele frequency (AF) at baseline correlated with better % change in radiographic Sum of Diameters (SoD) (Spearman&#8217;s rho=0.22, p &#60;0.001). Pts without baseline detectable plasma <i>KRAS<\/i> G12C had a median PFS of 11.5 months as compared to 4.1 months in those with detectable G12C (HR 2.8, p&#60;0.001), and were more likely to respond (HR = 2.76, p &#60;0.001). Pts with no baseline detectable ctDNA also had longer PFS (11.1 versus 5.1 months, HR 2.07, p=0.01). While responses were seen across a variety of genomic alterations, complete responders had fewer co-mutations overall. 75% (3) of complete responders (CRs) had no mutations of any kind detected vs 12% (19) of non-CRs (p=0.008, Fisher exact test). The number of altered genes was lower in responders (p&#60;0.001, Poisson regression), and CRs alone tended to have fewer altered genes (p=0.06), though the number of cases was very small (4). <i>EGFR<\/i> amplification at baseline was observed in patients who achieved a partial response (PR), but not a CR. The early kinetics of ctDNA comparing C1D2 to C1D1 and C2D1 to C1D8 did not differ between pts who had a decrease in SoD by RECIST on first scans (completed around C3D1) and those who had an increase (p&#62;0.1, tested by within and between group medians); both increases and decreases in G12C AF were seen at these time points regardless of radiographic changes. A subset of both responders (26% [13\/50]) and non-responders (54% [42\/78]), had a transient drop in ctDNA between C1D1 and C2D1 with a subsequent increase after C2D1. Those with no detectable ctDNA at C2D1 had longer median PFS (8.3 months) compared to those with detectable ctDNA (4.4 months, p=0.007).<br \/>Conclusion: At baseline, lower G12C AF and lower number of altered genes were associated with improved outcomes, suggesting there may be benefit to early initiation of sotorasib when co-mutational burden is low. Changes in ctDNA early in treatment are dynamic. Absence of detectable ctDNA at C2D1 may be associated with longer PFS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,NSCLC,Liquid biopsies,ctDNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yonina  R.

Since MTAP is the only enzyme responsible for methylthioadenosine (MTA) degradation, homozygous deletion of MTAP gene leads to intracellular accumulation of MTA. MTA competes with S-adenosylmethionine (SAM, the methyl donor) and results in partial inhibition of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) activity. Recent studies reported that tumor cells with MTAP loss are vulnerable to PRMT5 inhibition. Based on the synthetic lethality interaction, an MTA cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor has the potential to selectively target MTAP-deleted tumors and avoid hematologic toxicity of substrate-competitive (such as GSK3326595) or SAM-competitive (such as JNJ64619178) PRMT5 inhibitors.<br \/>Methods: A pair of HCT116 isogenic cell lines (MTAP-\/- and MTAP+\/+) were used to determine the effects of PH020-803 on cell proliferation and intracellular symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) content. Human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were collected to evaluate hematological toxicity. Intravenous injection of PH020-803 in rats were performed to assess the brain-penetration capability. The <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy was tested in cell derived xenograft (CDX) mouse models with tumor harboring MTAP gene deletion. The <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo <\/i>pharmacokinetic and safety properties were assessed with corresponding assay methods.<br \/>Results: PH020-803 dramatically decreased SDMA content and inhibited proliferation in HCT116 MTAP-\/- cells (SDMA, IC<sub>50<\/sub>=1.04 nM; proliferation, IC<sub>50<\/sub>=19 nM), but had very weak effect on HCT116 MTAP+\/+ cells (SDMA, IC<sub>50<\/sub>=535.5 nM; proliferation, IC<sub>50<\/sub>=1620 nM). In contrast, both GSK3326595 and JNJ64619178 had no obvious selectivity (proliferation: 595, IC<sub>50<\/sub>=8 nM and 35 nM in MTAP-\/- cells and MTAP+\/+ cells, respectively; 178, IC<sub>50<\/sub>=1 nM and 3 nM, respectively). PH020-803 mildly inhibited CD34+ HSC (IC<sub>50<\/sub>=900.2 nM), compared to potent cytotoxicity of GSK3326595 (IC<sub>50<\/sub>=15.8 nM). PH020-803 showed excellent brain penetration with a Kp value of 0.16. In two CDX models (HCT116 MTAP-\/- and LU99), PH020-803 at a dose of 100 mg\/kg QD potently inhibited tumor growth without hematologic toxicity observed. A 10-day repeated dosing study in mice (300 mg\/kg QD) suggested that red blood cell and reticulocyte counts significantly decreased in GSK3326595 group, but not in PH020-803 group. Caco-2 and MDCK-MDR1 assays demonstrated excellent membrane permeability of PH020-803 without obvious efflux. Accordingly, PH020-803 possessed good pharmacokinetic profile in mice and rats with absolute bioavailability at 74% and 58%, respectively.<br \/>Conclusion: The present data suggest that PH020-803 is an MTA-cooperative and brain-penetrable PRMT5 inhibitor that selectively targets MTAP-deleted tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Molecular targets,Synthetic lethality,Targeted therapy,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Feng Gao<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Bin Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Liandong Jing<sup>1<\/sup>, Yongyong Wu<sup>1<\/sup>, Pengzhi Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Shuai Yuan<sup>1<\/sup>, Hui Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, Yu Gao<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhizhong Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiaofan Wang<sup>3<\/sup>, Yongqi Guo<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Puhe Biopharma, Beijing, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Shiyu Children Foundation, Beijing, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d95ce3e8-14d2-4a0a-8f6d-e689f3a276ce","ControlNumber":"1440","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

For model LU5349, animals were imaged on the day before euthanasia at Day (D) 0, 6 and 16 of treatment (n=10 per time point). <b>Results<\/b>: Plasma concentrations of tepotinib 2 hours after the final administration at each time point were not proportional by dose, indicating a limited absorption at the higher dose. By D16, tumor measurements (&#177;SD) in tepotinib-treated mice (5.5 &#177; 3.4 mm<sup>3<\/sup>) were approximately 20-fold smaller than those in control mice (109.3 &#177; 50.1 mm<sup>3<\/sup>). At the lower dosing level, concentrations of tepotinib within the tumor regions decreased from 12 &#177; 6.4 &#181;M (D0) to 3.2 &#177; 2.7 &#181;M (D6) and then increased to 4.6 &#177; 1.2 &#181;M (D16).

Concentrations of tepotinib were below the limit of detection in non-tumor regions. K<sup>trans<\/sup> of the tumor was also affected by tepotinib treatment.

A possible causal association between reduced vascular permeability and the restricted distribution of tepotinib to tumor regions may exist.
