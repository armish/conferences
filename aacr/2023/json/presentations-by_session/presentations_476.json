[{"Abstract":"Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the U.S. and has a 5-year relative survival rate of only 11.5%. The etiology of pancreatic cancer is not well understood, with cigarette smoking, type 2 diabetes, and chronic pancreatitis as the only well-established risk factors. Therefore, it is critical to identify modifiable risk factors for primary prevention. Persistent oxidative stress and resultant oxidative damage can lead to accumulated mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and subsequent carcinogenesis of the pancreas. Carotenoids are abundant in fruits and vegetables, while tocopherols are rich in oilseeds and nuts. Both carotenoids and tocopherols have antioxidant functions. Thus, it is possible that high intake of these bioactive compounds can reduce risk of pancreatic cancer. The present study sought to investigate this question in a case-control study conducted during 1994-1998 in Minnesota. Cases (n=150), aged 20 years or older, were ascertained from all hospitals in the metropolitan area of the Twin Cities and the Mayo Clinic; from the latter, only cases residing in the Upper Midwest of the US were recruited. Controls (n=459) were randomly selected from the general population and frequency matched to cases by age (within 5 years) and sex. Intake of carotenoids and tocopherols from diet and supplements was estimated from a validated food frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using unconditional logistic regression. As lutein and zeaxanthin are isomers that have identical chemical formulas, they are combined into a single variable in the analysis. All dietary variables were adjusted for energy intake with the residual method prior to data analysis. After adjustment for age, sex, race, education, physical activity, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption, intake of lutein and zeaxanthin was associated with a significantly reduced risk of pancreatic cancer [OR (95% CI) for quartile 4 (median: 4972 &#181;g\/day) vs. quartile 1 (median: 976 &#181;g\/day): 0.39 (0.19-0.79); p-trend: 0.06]. This inverse association became slightly weaker but remained statistically significant after additional adjustment for intake of energy, fat, and fiber. No significant associations were observed for intake of &#945;-carotene, &#946;-carotene, lycopene, &#946;-cryptoxanthin, &#945;-tocopherol, &#946;-tocopherol, and &#948;-tocopherol, although a higher intake of all these nutrients except &#945;-tocopherol and &#948;-tocopherol tended to confer a lower risk. Our study shows that there is a significant, beneficial effect of lutein and zeaxanthin intake on pancreatic cancer risk, although it may be a chance finding due to multiple comparisons. More epidemiologic studies are warranted to further elucidate the roles of carotenoids and tocopherols in the etiology and prevention of pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Diet,Epidemiology,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Bronson Dokmanovich<sup>1<\/sup>, Hao fan<sup>2<\/sup>, Yunpeng Yu<sup>1<\/sup>, Kristin Anderson<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Jianjun Zhang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN,<sup>2<\/sup>Indiana University, Bloomington, IN,<sup>3<\/sup>University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6b056053-894f-4dcf-9f2c-0130ad54533b","ControlNumber":"614","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>B.

However, the association between different types of meat (processed and unprocessed red, and white) intake during childhood and breast density has not been explored. This prospective study included 290 Chilean girls from the Growth and Obesity Cohort Study. Diet was assessed every 6 months with a 24-hour recall. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to assess breast density (absolute fibroglandular volume (FGV)) and percent breast density (FGV\/total breast volume, %FGV) at Tanner Breast Staging 4 (B4). Multivariable linear regression models were adjusted for total calorie intake, age at B4, sugar sweetened beverage intake, vegetable intake, TV watching after school, highest maternal education level, BMI z-score, and height. Substitution analysis was assessed using white meat in replacement of processed and unprocessed red meat. There was no association between total, processed and unprocessed red, or white meat intake and %FGV and absolute FGV. In the estimated substitution analyses, we observed a slightly lower breast density when processed or unprocessed red meat was replaced with white meat; however, effect estimates were modest and imprecise. For example, substituting 1 serving of unprocessed white meat for 1 serving of processed or unprocessed red meat was associated -4.1 cm<sup>3<\/sup> (95% CI -10.3, 2.2) and -4.5 cm<sup>3<\/sup> (95% CI -10.3, 1.3) lower absolute FGV, respectively.

One-carbon metabolism is a set of complex pathways, responsible for providing methyl group for DNA synthesis, repair and methylation. Adequate DNA methylation maintains chromosome stability and prevents gene disruption. Diet is a major source for key substrates and co-factors (i.e., vitamin B6, choline and folate) involved in one-carbon metabolism. A majority of epidemiologic studies that have evaluated one-carbon metabolism-related nutrients in relation to CRC risk have focused on the potential role of folate only. Due to the involvement of multiple nutrients and the complexity of one-carbon metabolism pathways, a comprehensive assessment of the nutrients involved and their associations with CRC risk is needed. The purpose of the current analysis was therefore to evaluate the association between one-carbon metabolism-related nutrients with the risk of developing CRC using the Singapore Chinese Health Study (SCHS).<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>. The SCHS is an on-going population-based prospective cohort study that includes 61,321 Chinese men and women in Singapore who were 45-74 years of age at baseline. A 165-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to obtain information of dietary intake. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CRC associated with one-carbon metabolism-related nutrients, including thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate acid, vitamin B12, choline, methionine, and betaine, adjusting for potential confounders.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>. After an average of 17.5 years of follow-up, 2,140 participants developed CRC. An inverse association between folate acid and colon cancer. The HRs and respective 95% CIs for quarters 2, 3 and 4 vs. quarter 1 (the lowest quartile) was 0.98 (0.84-1.14), 0.93 (0.79-1.10) and 0.80 (0.64-0.98) (<i>P<sub>trend<\/sub><\/i>=0.04). Similar pattern was observed between folate acid intake and colon cancer risk among never smokers (HR<sub>Q4vsQ1<\/sub>=0.67, 95% CI: 0.51-0.86; <i>P<sub>trend<\/sub><\/i>=0.005). No association was found between other one-carbon metabolism-related nutrients and the risk of colorectal cancer<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>. In a large on-going prospective cohort study of more than 61,000 Chinese Singaporeans, we found inverse associations between dietary folate acid and the risk of colon cancer. This association was more obvious among never smokers. Our findings provide critical implication for primary prevention and control of colorectal cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diet,Colorectal cancer,Risk factors,Prevention,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yen Thi-Hai Pham<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Aizhen Jin<sup>2<\/sup>, Renwei Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Woon-Puay Koh<sup>2<\/sup>, Jian-Min Yuan<sup>1<\/sup>, Hung  N.

To date, limited data provides the quantification of the effect exerted by fatty acids (FAs) on CRC overall and by anatomical sub-sites. This study aims to look at associations between some FAs intakes [cholesterol, total fat, total saturated fatty acids (SFAs), total monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), total trans fatty acids (TFAs), oleic acid, myristic acid, total ruminant (rTFAs) and industrial fatty acids (iTFAs), eliadic acid (EA), conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), and CRC risk in a large case-control study (IROPICAN) in Iran . We analyzed 865 CRC cases (434 in colon, 404 in rectum, and 27 with unknown subsite) and 3,206 controls from seven provinces of Iran. Detailed information was collected by trained interviewers using validated lifestyle and food frequency questionnaires (FFQ). The different types of total and individual FAs intake were categorized into quartiles of intake. The odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between CRC them were calculated using multivariate logistic regression models by adjusting for the potential confounders. Furthermore, analyses were stratified by age (under and over 50) and also, we repeated the analyses for CRC subsites. There was a statistically significant positive association between CRC and high intake (quartile 4) compared to the low intake (quartile) of dietary total fat (OR=1.77, 95% CI=1.32-2.38), cholesterol (OR=1.58, 95% CI=1.22-2.05), total TFAs (OR=1.31, 95% CI=1.02-1.68), TFAs (OR=1.73, 95% CI=1.12-2.68), EA(OR=2.69, 95% CI=1.46-4.93), and SM (OR=1.45, 95% CI=1.00-2.09), as well as an inverse association with high intake of dietary rTFAs (OR=0.60, 95% CI=0.39-0.93), CLAs (OR=0.34, 95% CI=0.19- 0.60). Stratified analyses by age indicated that there was a statistically significant association between CRC and total fat intake [OR =1.30, 95% CI =1.16-1.46, p=0.006 for the interaction], cholesterol intake [OR =1.22, 95% CI=1.11-1.35, p=0.019 for the interaction], and iTFA intake [OR =1.31, 95% CI=1.06-1.62, p=0.02 for the interaction] after 50 years old. The results of our study indicate that decreasing fat consumption, particularly from industrial and animal sources, may reduce the risk of CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Fatty acids,Diet,Risk Factor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Monireh Sadat Seyyedsalehi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Paolo Boffetta<sup>1<\/sup>, Kazem Zendehdel<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy,<sup>2<\/sup>Cancer Research Center, Cancer Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7481748c-1cb1-46d0-a612-679d28f88485","ControlNumber":"6081","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

However, unlike long-chain saturated fatty acids, MCFAs possess many unique properties, including inhibition of pro-carcinogenic bacteria, biofilm formation, and induction of apoptosis. Further, C12:0 has been consistently shown <i>in vitro<\/i> to exhibit the most potent anti-microbial properties in a dose-dependent manner compared to other MCFAs. Black Americans have the highest CRC incidence and mortality across all racial subgroups in the US. In a predominantly low-income population, we aimed to examine whether dietary intake of MCFAs is associated with a reduced risk of CRC overall and among racial subgroups.<br \/>Methods: The daily intake of total energy and individual nutrients, including MCFAs, was derived from a food frequency questionnaire. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression was used to assess the associations between dietary intake of MCFAs and the risk of incident CRC during the 13.75-year follow up after adjustment for confounders.<br \/>Results: Among 71,599 eligible participants, 868 incident CRC cases were identified (622 Blacks, 220 Whites and 26 other racial groups). High intake of C12:0 was significantly associated with a reduced risk of CRC only in White participants in a dose-response manner (for highest VS lowest quartile: HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.80; <i>P<\/i><sub> <\/sub>for trend =0.0068). This protective association primarily appeared in White participants at high risk of CRC, such as those aged 50 years or older, overweight or obese, ever smokers, or living in a neighborhood with greater deprivation. On the other hand, we did not find a significant association in Black participants (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.27); <i>P<\/i> for trend =0.72). However, there was a marginal linear association in Black participants with the lowest deprivation index while the association disappeared among Black participants with higher deprivation index. Finally, we found from the NHANES 2005-2016, a representative sample of the US general population, that Black Americans had the lowest intake of MCFAs across all racial subgroups and, overall, intakes of MCFAs decreased with reducing poverty-income ratio. No associations were found between intakes of C6:0, C8:0, or C10:0 and the risk of incident CRC overall or within the racial group.<br \/>Conclusion: In this predominantly low-income population, increasing dietary C12:0 intake was associated with a substantially reduced risk of CRC only among White participants, but not in Black participants. This racial difference in associations may be because Black Americans consumed the lowest levels of MCFAs in all racial groups while a much higher proportion of Black participants had lactose intolerance and a lower proportion of them consumed lactose-free fermented foods.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fatty acids,Colorectal cancer,Race,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lei Fan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Xiangzhu Zhu<sup>1<\/sup>, Qingxia Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiang Huang<sup>1<\/sup>, Mark D.

Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association of metabolomic signature with CRC risk after adjusting for known confounders.<br \/>Results: During a median follow-up time of 8.2 years, 818 incident primary CRC cases were identified after participants were enrolled for more than two years. We observed a strong partial correlation between the metabolomic signature and HLS (<i>r <\/i>= 0.34), as well as waist-to-hip ratio, sedentary time, red and processed meat intake, and tobacco smoking aspects of the HLS (<i>r <\/i>= 0.14-0.33). A higher HLS was characterized by a signature of increased levels of linoleic acid, total cholines, and polyunsaturated fatty acids and decreased levels of omega-6 fatty acids, phospholipids in intermediate-density lipoprotein, and phosphatidylcholines. The metabolomic signature showed a significantly inverse association with CRC risk (HR = 0.84; 95% CI = 0.80-0.89 per standard deviation increment). The significantly inverse associations were observed irrespective of sex, educational attainment, and CRC subsite. Stronger associations were seen among participants aged between 50 and 60 years at study enrollment, and those diagnosed with CRC at 60 years old or later.<br \/>Conclusion: We identified a metabolomic signature characterizing adherence to the ACS guidelines and showed that the signature was inversely associated with CRC risk.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Healthy lifestyles,Metabolomics,Epidemiology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Fangcheng Yuan<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Danxia Yu<sup><\/sup>, Wanqing Wen<sup><\/sup>, Wei Zheng<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Division of Epidemiology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"453edc2d-07be-48a6-b579-df5ba502712b","ControlNumber":"1709","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

However, the relationship between blood magnesium level and the risk of liver cancer has not been fully established, especially among cirrhosis patients where magnesium deficiency commonly occurred. To address this knowledge gap, we have established a prospective cohort of patients with liver cirrhosis based on real-world, electronic health record data.<br \/>Methods: In the Mass General Brigham Biobank, a biorepository of consented patients, we established a prospective cohort by identifying liver cirrhosis patients using the International Classification of Diseases 9<sup>th<\/sup> and 10<sup>th<\/sup> version codes (ICD-9: 571.2, 571.5, and 571.6; ICD-10: K70.3, K74.3-6). We excluded patients with liver cancer history or without blood magnesium assessment at the time of cirrhosis diagnosis (baseline). We identified subsequent incident liver cancer (ICD-9: 155; ICD-10: C22) and levels of liver function biomarkers assessed at each hospital visit, including alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). We used Cox regression models to generate ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for developing liver cancer according to quartiles (Qs) of baseline blood magnesium levels, adjusting for age, sex, race, smoking status, alcohol intake, physical activity, body mass index, diabetes, ALT, and hepatitis B\/C infection. We used generalized estimating equation (GEE) models to estimate the associations between baseline blood magnesium levels and repeated measurements of liver function biomarkers after cirrhosis diagnosis.<br \/>Results: We included 1257 liver cirrhosis patients (median age at diagnosis 59.5 years; 36% female; 87% white) with magnesium levels measured at baseline. During a median follow-up period of 3.55 (range: 0.1-12) years from liver cirrhosis diagnosis, 106 developed liver cancer. In multivariable-adjusted Cox models, higher baseline blood magnesium (Q4: &#8805;2.10 mg\/dL vs. Q1: &#60;1.80 mg\/dL) was associated with a lower risk of liver cancer (HR<sub>Q4 vs. Q1<\/sub> = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.33, 0.99; p-trend =0.03). Results remained similar in 1-year lagged analysis. In multivariable-adjusted GEE models, higher magnesium was associated with a slower change of ALT (coefficient<sub>Q4 vs. Q1<\/sub> = -7.09; 95% CI: -12.6, -1.62) and AST (coefficient<sub>Q4 vs. Q1<\/sub> = -8.06; 95% CI: -13.9, -2.25).<br \/>Conclusions: In a prospective cohort of high-risk population with liver cirrhosis, higher blood magnesium was associated with a lower risk of developing liver cancer and a slower change of biomarkers suggestive of liver function. Magnesium is implicated in liver carcinogenesis and progression, therefore monitoring and maintaining blood magnesium could be important to delay the progression from cirrhosis to cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-02 Biomarkers of endogenous or exogenous exposures, early detection, and biologic effects,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,Magnesium,Prospective cohort,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xinyuan Zhang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Longgang Zhao<sup>2<\/sup>, Tao Hou<sup>3<\/sup>, Michelle Lai<sup>4<\/sup>, Qi Dai<sup>5<\/sup>, Xuehong Zhang<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Channing Division of Network Medicine, Harvard Medical School\/Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC,<sup>3<\/sup>Epidemiology, Harvard T.

Specifically, early developmental exposures have been shown to increase susceptibility to cancer in adults through epigenetic mechanisms. Alcohol is a potent environmental carcinogen and teratogen, causing a wide range of health problems across the life course of an individual. Current literature examining early life exposures solely focuses on maternal exposures despite recent efforts to recognize paternal epigenetic contributions. Thus, we investigated the influence of preconception paternal, maternal, and dual parental alcohol exposures on offspring&#8217;s predisposition to develop liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We hypothesized that dual-parental alcohol exposure would exacerbate the incidence of liver cancer in adult offspring.<br \/>Using an established mouse model, we exposed male and female adult C57BL\/6J mice to control (0% EtOH) or alcohol (10% EtOH) preconception treatments. Next, we randomly assigned pups from each treatment to either a single injection of Diethylnitrosamine (DEN; 25mg\/kg) to promote liver tumors, or saline control. Finally, we sacrificed offspring on postnatal day 182 and collected organs and blood for enzyme analysis.<br \/>DEN-treated males display an increased liver-to-body weight ratio compared to saline males while also exhibiting lower body weight. The male progeny from the dual-parental treatment group exhibited a significant increase in tumor incidence and burden in DEN-treated males, exceeding those measured for the maternal and paternal treatments. Further, offspring from the dual-parental group had high levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) compared to the other treatment groups. Oil Red-O and Sirius Red staining of liver sections revealed increased hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in DEN males compared to saline males. Again, the dual-parental exposed offspring exhibited the most aberrant phenotype. Blind scoring of H&#38;E-stained liver sections identified increases in steatosis, fibrosis, and HCC lesions, with the highest scores emerging in DEN-treated dual-parental offspring.<br \/>These findings demonstrate that preconception paternal and gestational maternal alcohol exposures program a predisposition to adult-onset chronic diseases including alcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatic fibrosis, and HCC. These experiments not only confirm our hypothesis that dual-parental exposed offspring exhibit an exacerbated hepatic abnormality phenotype, but also highlight the importance of both maternal and paternal environmental exposures on disease risk in offspring. While the negative effects of maternal alcohol consumption have been well established, our novel finding that paternal alcohol exposure also promotes hepatocellular carcinoma in offspring has potentially profound clinical implications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Alcohol,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Epigenetics,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alison Basel<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sanat  S.

This study aimed to investigate the association of various smoking-related factors with the risk of gastric cancer in a population with a high incidence rate of gastric cancer.<br \/>Method: From 2004 to 2013, Korean adults 40-69 years of age were enrolled in the large-scale prospective cohort, the Health Examinees-Gem study. Incident gastric cancer cases were identified until December 31, 2017, through linkage to the Korea Central Cancer Registry. Participants&#8217; information regarding socio-demographics, smoking-related factors, and other lifestyle factors was obtained via self-reported questionnaires. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for gastric cancer risk associated with smoking-related factors such as smoking duration, amount, pack-years, and age of smoking initiation.<br \/>Results: Among 44,207 men included in the final analysis, 565 gastric cancer cases were identified during a mean (&#177;SD) follow-up period of 8.6 (&#177;2.0) years. Compared to non-smokers, current smokers who smoked for more than 35 years (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.06-1.96) or with &#8805;30 pack-years of smoking (HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.05-1.87) were positively associated with gastric cancer. These associations were shown to be significant with increasing smoking years (<i>p <\/i>trend 0.019) and pack-years (0.016) as well. Compared to non-smokers, current smokers who initiated smoking at a younger age, before or at 20 years, were at a higher risk of gastric cancer (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.10-1.93). No significant associations were observed among former smokers. When stratified by smoking duration, increased risk of gastric cancer was observed among those who smoked for more than 25 years in the younger smoking initiation age group (&#8804;20 years; HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.15-1.94). In terms of smoking intensity, those who smoked less than 20 cigarettes or 1 pack a day showed an increased risk of gastric cancer in the younger smoking initiation age group that began smoking before or at 20 years of age (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.30-2.44).<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings suggest that earlier initiation of smoking is associated with a greater risk of gastric cancer. Among those who began smoking early, longer duration is an important factor, but increased gastric cancer risk was also observed among those who smoked moderate amount on a daily basis. Thus, measures to manage and control onset age of cigarette smoking among teenagers may be considered when taking actions against the health burden of gastric cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Alcohol,Cohort study,Prevention,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hwi-Won Lee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Woo-Kyoung Shin<sup>1<\/sup>, Dan Huang<sup>2<\/sup>, Katherine De la Torre<sup>1<\/sup>, Jae Jeong Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Minkyo Song<sup>1<\/sup>, Aesun Shin<sup>1<\/sup>, Kyoung-Mu Lee<sup>3<\/sup>, Hyuk-Joon Lee<sup>4<\/sup>, Jong-koo Lee<sup>5<\/sup>, Daehee Kang<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Preventive Medicine, SNU Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>SNU Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Environment Health, Korea National Open University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>Surgery, SNU Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>5<\/sup>Family Medicine, SNU Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"30aa0408-3733-48fc-9369-c6364f15378c","ControlNumber":"4407","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

Further, absolute risk of BC by smoking history has not yet been reported. Characterizing these associations will identify value of smoking cessation across non-European ancestry populations.<br \/>Methods: We estimated the association between pack-years, years quit, and BC among 181,231 Multiethnic Cohort Study participants from five major racial\/ethnic groups (African Americans [AA], European Americans [EA], Japanese Americans [JA], Latinos [LA], Native Hawaiians [NH]) 45-75 years old at enrollment (1993-1996). Smoking history was assessed by self-report at cohort entry and on a follow-up survey (2003-2008). Associations were estimated using an excess relative risk model to distinguish between variables that affect baseline risk and variables (e.g. years quit) that only affect excess risk due to smoking, while adjusting for sex, age, race\/ethnicity, diabetes, body mass index, and cigarettes smoked per day. BC cases were identified through SEER cancer registries to 2017. We tested for heterogeneity of smoking variables by race\/ethnicity and estimated incidence across age, race-ethnicity, pack-years, and years quit.<br \/>Results: Over a mean 19 years of follow-up, 1,914 BC cases were identified. Age-standardized incidence rates of BC were highest among EA (51\/100,000) and lowest among LA (24\/100,000). Never smokers were most common among JA and LA (51%) and least common in other racial\/ethnic groups (39-40%). In the full study sample, 50 pack-years smoked was associated with BC (HR=3.2 95% CI 2.7, 3.6). The association was heterogeneous by race\/ethnicity (p=0.02) and statistically significant within each racial\/ethnic group (p&#60;0.05), except NH (p=0.07). Associations were strongest among EA (HR=4.0), followed by AA (HR=3.6), JA (HR=2.7), LA (HR=2.6), and NH (HR=2.4). There was no statistically significant heterogeneity of smoking cessation (p=0.08) or cigarettes smoked per day (p=0.82) by race\/ethnicity. Each year quit resulted in a less than 1% decrease in the excess relative risk from smoking (p=0.12). The absolute risk models showed highest incidence at age 70 among EA current smokers (176\/100,000) and lowest among AA never smokers (27\/100,000). At age 70, current smokers across all ethnic groups had lower risk than EA who quit at age 45.<br \/>Conclusion: Pack-years smoked is significantly associated with BC risk. EA and AA groups experience the greatest excess relative risk from smoking and NH the lowest. Reduction in excess relative risk following smoking cessation is weak, meaning the cumulative effect of pack-years smoked on BC risk cannot easily be attenuated with quitting. This contrasts with the risk reduction seen for lung and pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Epidemiology,Smoking,Modeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>David Bogumil<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Victoria Cortessis<sup>1<\/sup>, Daniel Stram<sup>1<\/sup>, Veronica  W.

Cigarette smoking is a leading cancer risk factor. In addition to quitting smoking, reducing the number of cigarettes\/day may decrease risk of lung cancer compared with continuing to smoke more heavily. However, few cohort studies have longitudinal assessments of cigarette use. <b>Methods<\/b>. We examined the association of changes in smoking status (trying to quit, not smoking at this time, and still smoking) and changes in cigarettes\/day with subsequent incidence of lung cancer in 24,613 Finnish male participants of the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study, a cancer prevention trial of vitamin supplements that collected serial assessments of cigarette use. At baseline (1985-1988), all participants were current smokers 50-69 years old who smoked 5+ cigarettes\/day. During the five-to-eight year intervention period, men were asked at 4-month intervals about changes in their smoking use since their last visit. We obtained individual estimates of the proportion of follow-up time (% of time) in each of the three smoking statuses, the transition probabilities between statuses and intercepts and slopes for the number of cigarettes\/day. We then examined associations between changes in smoking and in cigarettes\/day and subsequent incidence of lung cancer occurring between the end of the trial (April 30, 1993) and December 31, 2012. Using Cox regression, we modeled lung cancer risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) associated with changes in smoking (% of time and number of cigarettes\/day) relative to individuals who smoked 20 cigarettes\/day across all the study visits. Models were additionally adjusted for age at the end of the trial, ATBC intervention group, education, and age at smoking initiation. <b>Results<\/b>. Overall, 3013 lung cancers were diagnosed during follow-up. The risk of lung cancer was lower among participants who reduced their smoking intensity by 5 or 10 cigarettes\/day [RR=0.80(95%CI:0.71,0.89) and RR=0.64(95%CI:0.51,0.81), respectively]. RRs were further decreased among participants who also smoked at only 50% of study visits [-5 cigarettes\/day RR=0.71(95%CI:0.57, 0.90) and -10 cigarettes\/day RR=0.46(95%CI:0.44, 0.74)]. Individuals with the lowest risk were those who stopped smoking early at follow-up and continued to not smoke over the intervention period.

Smoking tobacco is associated with three signatures involving single base substitutions (SBS4), double base substitutions (DBS2) and insertions\/deletions (ID3). Combining mutational signatures with clinical data allows examination of temporal and quantitative aspects of carcinogenic exposures. We analyzed 132 non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) whole genomes, sequenced through the 100,000 Genomes Project (Genomics England), with paired clinical data available for 130\/132 (98.5%). Clinical data included smoking status, duration, pack-years (py), and duration of smoking cessation. The majority were &#8220;ever-smokers&#8221; (ex-smokers: 90\/130, 69.2%; current smokers: 32\/130, 24.6%) and 120\/122 (98.4%) had at least one smoking signature. DBS2 was the most sensitive signature for ever-smokers (118\/122, 96.7%), although SBS4 was the optimal signature for diagnosing smoking-related NSCLCs (SBS4 positive likelihood ratio 7.15). An absence of ID3 best identified true never smoker NSCLCs (ID3 negative likelihood ratio 0.08). Ever-smokers had a higher tumor mutational burden (TMB) than never smokers (median 8.25 mutations\/Mb vs 1.18 mutations\/Mb, p = &#60;0.0001), while TMB positively correlated with smoking pack-years (p = 0.044). Following smoking cessation, the median length of discontinuation was 11 years before a smoking-related NSCLC was diagnosed and, in some cases, smoking signatures persisted for up to 50 years prior to NSCLC diagnosis. To complement existing epidemiological data, 40 pack years was estimated as a critical cut-off for minimizing ongoing NSCLC risk. Prolonged smoking cessation did not reduce TMB (p = 0.055) or SBS4 mutations (p = 0.11), although this did produce lower DBS2 counts (p = 0.0067). Further signatures observed included SBS92 (previously seen in the bladder urothelium of ever-smokers) and a novel signature hypothesized to be linked to DNA mismatch repair deficiencies. NSCLCs from two patients with prior platinum chemo-radiotherapy harbored signatures of both chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced damage in their recurrent biopsy sample. These results highlight the importance of paired sequencing and clinical data, revealing that smoking-induced DNA damage can have long-lived effects, and strengthening health guidance of abstinence from smoking at the earliest possibility.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tobacco,Smoking,Lung cancer,Mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Colin R.

However, most of the associations reported in female smokers with natural menopause were not observed in those with surgical menopause, (a mixed group of subjects with bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy without bilateral oophorectomy). Females with bilateral oophorectomy lose ovarian estrogen and progesterone production, while females with hysterectomy, +\/- unilateral oophorectomy, maintain some of this hormone production. We hypothesize that associations between early menopause, lung health and mortality will vary based on type of menopause. Among 69,071 females from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, early menopause rates were 8.7%, 44.1%, and 72.8% in never smokers versus 12.1%, 51.6%, and 78.0% in ever smokers with natural, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy without bilateral oophorectomy, respectively. We analyzed the associations of early menopause and hormone therapy with lung health (physician diagnosed emphysema and chronic bronchitis and lung cancer incidence) and mortality (all-cause and cause-specific) outcomes by smoking status and menopause types. The most consistent associations were observed for all-cause mortality: 1) Except in never smokers who received hysterectomy only, early menopause was associated with higher all-cause mortality regardless of smoking status 2) hormone therapy was associated with lower all-cause mortality in all groups and the longer the use, the more beneficial the outcome; 3) the magnitude of this association was strongest in those who underwent bilateral oophorectomy. Furthermore, in ethnic disparity analysis, all-cause mortality was affected by early menopause to a lesser degree in non-Hispanic black ever smokers and there was increased benefit from hormone therapy in non-Hispanic black never smokers. Overall, we identified further evidence supporting early menopause as a risk factor for lung health and mortality and hormone therapy as being beneficial regardless of smoking status or menopause type. Our results support the &#8220;shorter lifetime estrogen exposure in early menopause&#8221; hypothesis and the clinical importance of hormone therapy beyond withdrawal symptom coping.<br \/>Supported by National Cancer Institute (NCI) grant P30 CA118100.

This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We performed a systematic literature search up to November 2022 in English in the PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted as effect sizes. Publication bias was estimated by the funnel plot method. We collected the data from 15 cohort studies and 30 case-control studies meeting the search criteria. The meta-analysis found that fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with a 27% and 35% lower risk of breast cancer, respectively [RR = 0.73 (0.56, 0.96); RR = 0.65 (0.47, 0.90)]. By contrast, no significance was found between meat, soy food, and green tea consumption and breast cancer risk (<i>P<\/i> &#62; 0.05). However, soy protein and isoflavone intake could lower breast cancer risk by 35% and 32%, respectively [RR = 0.65 (0.51, 0.83); RR = 0.68 (0.55, 0.82)]. As for dietary pattern, higher adherence to a healthy dietary pattern and healthy eating index was associated with a 38% and 62% reduction in breast cancer risk, respectively [RR = 0.62 (0.44, 0.88; RR = 0.38 (0.22, 0.67)], while high adherence to an unhealthy dietary pattern was associated with a 44% increased risk [RR = 1.44 (1.06, 1.96)]. Considering alcohol consumption, a 75% increased risk of breast cancer was found [RR= 1.75 (1.33, 2.30)]. The present meta-analysis found that high intakes of fruit, vegetable, soy protein, and soy isoflavone significantly reduced the risk of breast cancer, while high intake of alcohol had a significantly increased risk. Meat, soy food, and green tea consumption were not significantly associated with breast cancer risk. Considering dietary patterns, higher adherence to a healthy eating index and a healthy dietary pattern may reduce breast cancer risk. Conversely, adherence to unhealthy dietary patterns may increase breast cancer risk. However, further studies are needed to confirm the associations between dietary patterns and breast cancer in the Asian population.

Excess iron can be toxic, and animal models have demonstrated that excess iron promotes tumor growth, whereas iron deficiency reduces or slows tumor growth. Few observational studies have assessed associations between serum iron levels and human tumor characteristics. The objective of this study is to estimate the associations between serum iron levels and tumor size at diagnosis in breast cancer cases from The Sister Study, a large prospective cohort based in the United States.<br \/>Methods: Data are from a case-cohort sample of the Sister Study selected in 2016 to study serum iron levels. Of the 3,007 invasive or ductal carcinoma in situ cases included, we used the 2,494 incident breast cancer cases with information on tumor size and iron levels. Serum iron (mcg\/dL), ferritin (mcg\/dL), and percent transferrin saturation were measured in samples collected at baseline (median time from collection to diagnosis 4.6 years). Prior to modeling, we applied a natural log transformation to the largest tumor size and ferritin levels. To estimate the associations between body iron levels and tumor size, we used Spearman&#8217;s rank correlation and linear regression models adjusting for body mass index and age at study entry. If there were multiple tumor measures for one person, we selected the largest tumor size. Sensitivity analyses included: 1) restricting analyses to diagnoses more than 6 months after or less than 4 years after baseline iron measures, 2) excluding women who reported taking iron supplements, and 3) stratifying analyses by tumor subtypes.<br \/>Results: Associations between all three serum iron levels and tumor size were close to the null, indicating no evidence of an association between iron and tumor size. Spearman&#8217;s rank correlations were all close to zero. Adjusted regression slopes (95% confidence interval) were -0.0005 (-0.0010, 0.0005) for serum iron, -0.0163 (-0.055, 0.022) for ferritin, and -0.0009 (-0.004, 0.0021) for percent transferrin saturation. Results from the sensitivity analyses did not substantively differ from our primary findings.<br \/>Conclusions: We did not find evidence to support the hypothesis of a positive association between breast cancer tumor size at the time of diagnosis and serum iron levels.

However, little is known about long-term health effects of tattooing. Some tattoo inks contain carcinogens, which can interact with solar radiation to produce potentially toxic compounds. Tattoo inks can also migrate to the lymphatic system and produce inflammatory and immune responses. In this study, we evaluated whether tattooing exposures were associated with risk of hematologic malignancies.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> This population-based case-control study included 656 cases of hematologic malignancies (156 myeloid neoplasms and 500 lymphomas), ages 19-79 years, who were diagnosed between July 2019 and December 2021, and identified through the Utah Cancer Registry using rapid case ascertainment. Controls were selected from ~19,000 adult Utah residents who participated in the 2020 Utah Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) statewide survey and frequency matched to cases in a 3:1 ratio on age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Telephone surveys collected data on number of tattoo sessions, number of large tattoos, age at first tattoo, and relevant covariates. We fit binary logistic regression models for general hematologic malignancies and multinomial logistic regression models for myeloid neoplasms and lymphomas, to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each tattoo variable, adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity, education level, past cancer diagnosis (yes\/no), and ever smoker (yes\/no).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> There was no strong evidence that ever having received a tattoo versus never having received a tattoo was associated with risk of overall hematologic cancers (OR=1.01, 95% CI: [0.96-1.07]), myeloid neoplasms (1.12 [0.59-2.13]), or lymphomas (1.07 [0.77-1.49]). However, having three or more large tattoos, compared with never having received a tattoo, was suggestively associated with an increased risk of overall hematologic cancers (1.33 [0.69-2.47]). The effect estimate was strongest among myeloid neoplasms (1.73 [0.54-5.50]). Compared with never having received a tattoo, receiving a first tattoo before age 20 was associated with an elevated risk of myeloid neoplasms (2.00 [0.91-4.38]), and receiving a first tattoo at age 20 or older was associated with an elevated risk of lymphoma (1.24 [0.84-1.83]), though the estimates were imprecise.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>We observed a potential association between having several large tattoos and risk of hematologic cancers, particularly myeloid neoplasms. The risk of myeloid neoplasms appeared to be strongest among individuals receiving tattoos at young age. If confirmed, these findings could inform public health messaging about the safety of tattoos.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias,Lymphoma,Epidemiology,Risk factors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Rachel  D.

This study aims to understand factors associated with knowledge of THC or CBD potency in cannabis products among a sample of cancer patients and survivors who consumed cannabis since diagnosis.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Data were analyzed from a random sample of cancer patients and survivors using cannabis (n=343) and completed an anonymous, mixed-mode survey at Roswell Park. Survey questions asked about modes of use post-cancer diagnosis including smoking (joints\/bongs\/pipes\/blunts), vaping (e-cigarettes\/other vaping device), eating cannabis (foods\/drinks), and taking orally (pills\/tinctures\/sublingually), and knowledge of cannabinoid potency was defined as knowing THC or CBD (mg or %) against no knowledge. Chi-square and separate multivariable logistic regression analyses for the most prevalent modes of cannabis use (smoking and eating) were examined to determine factors associated with knowledge of THC and CBD potency. Models controlled for acquisition source (informal; unlicensed seller vs formal; licensed seller), cannabis use instruction source (informal; personal vs formal; healthcare professional), current use status, and educational attainment.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Prevalence of cannabis use following cancer diagnosis was 26.5% (20.9% among patients in active treatment; 29.2% among survivors).<b> <\/b>Among consumers, eating cannabis foods\/drinking cannabis beverages was the most prevalent mode of delivery (58.6%), followed by smoking cannabis in joints (52.8%), vaping (30.3%), and taking oral pills, tinctures, or sublingually (29.2%). Overall, 27.2% had knowledge of THC and CBD potency of the products that they consumed.

Teenagers with strong sun-seeking behaviors are more likely to use an indoor tanning bed than those who seek less sun, probably due to addictive component of ultraviolet exposure. We aimed to examine the associations between sun exposure behaviors and average annual indoor tanning usage frequency during high school\/college in US females.<br \/>Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we included a total of 76,122 US females who answered the average annual frequency of indoor tanning during high school\/college from the Nurses&#8217; Health Study II, a large prospective cohort of US female nurses. We adjusted for age, daily number of cigarettes, number of alcohol drinks, strenuous sports frequency, hair color, family history of melanoma, chronic disease history, and mole numbers.<br \/>Results: In multivariable-adjusted multinomial logistic regression models, we demonstrated positive and dose response associations between sun exposure behaviors and annual times of indoor tanning bed usage. Specifically, teenagers who spent daily outdoors in a swimsuit (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 95% confidence interval [CI] for daily vs. &#60;1\/week: 3.17, 1.63-6.15) were more likely to use indoor tanning beds. High school students and undergraduates who spent &#8805;5hours\/week outdoors in direct sunlight during daytime also showed more usage of indoor tanning beds (aOR, 95% CI for &#8805;5hours vs. &#60;1\/week: 2.01, 1.06-3.79). Teenagers who had &#8805;10 sunburns that blistered also tended to more frequently use indoor tanning beds (aOR, 95% CI for &#8805;10 vs. Never: 2.32, 1.41-3.82).<br \/>Conclusions and Relevance: Teenagers who more spent outdoors in a swimsuit or in direct sunlight during daytime, or got more sunburns tended to use indoor tanning more frequently than those who did not. These findings provide evidence that teenagers with strong sun-seeking behaviors have excessive exposure to ultraviolet through indoor tanning.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\"

This study aims to investigate whether sick leave due to psychological stress can affect the risk of developing cancer.<br \/>Method: This is a matched case-control study using Swedish nation-wide register data (study period 2005-2018). The main exposure is stress-related sick leave defined as registered sick leave due to psychological stress with the diagnosis codes of F43 (International Classification of Diseases codes: ICD) and its subclassifications and hereafter referred to as stress leave. For each primary cancer case (except non-melanoma skin cancer), up to five cancer-free controls were matched based on sex, age and county. Conditional logistic regression, conditioned on matching factors and adjusting for socioeconomic factors, was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For subgroup analyses by specific tumor sites, Bonferroni-corrected significance level of 0.002 (alpha value divided by the number of tumor sites = 0.05\/24) was also applied.<br \/>Results: The study comprised 516 678 cancer cases and 2 357 433 matched controls. Stress leave of any duration, was associated with a modestly increased risk of cancer, with the highest risk observed for 1-30 days of leave, vs no leave during follow-up (adjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.09). In subgroup analyses by tumor sites, stress leave was associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (adjusted OR for &#62;90 days vs no stress leave 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.20) and cervix cancer (adjusted OR<sub>&#62;90 days vs no leave<\/sub> 1.11, 95% CI 1.05-1.17). For lung cancer, an inverse risk relationship was found (adjusted OR<sub>&#62;90 days vs no leave<\/sub> 0.88, 95% CI 0.77-0.99). For other tumor sites, associations were generally null or had wide confidence intervals. After applying a Bonferroni-corrected significance level, the association was still significant for cervical cancer. Further examination by sex, specific types of psychological stress and cancer groups based on established etiology (tobacco use, obesity, alcohol consumption and gastric hyperacidity) showed a clear exposure-response trend in men and pronounced associations for exhaustion disorder (ICD code: F43.8A) and tobacco-related cancers. In a post-hoc analysis, the association for other HPV-related cancers was similar to that for cervical cancer but not statistically significant.<br \/>Conclusion: In this register study covering the entire Swedish population, we found that stress-related sick leave was associated with modestly higher risk of cancer, particularly the risk of cervical cancer. Potential higher risk of prostate cancer and lower risk of lung cancer were observed, though these associations were not statistically significant after controlling for multiple testing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer risk,Risk factors,Epidemiology,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sai San Moon Lu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jenny Hadrévi<sup>2<\/sup>, Lisbeth Slunga Järvholm<sup>2<\/sup>, Florentin Späth<sup>1<\/sup>, Richard Palmqvist<sup>3<\/sup>, Tommy Olsson<sup>2<\/sup>, Sophia Harlid<sup>1<\/sup>, Bethany van Guelpen<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Radiation Sciences, Oncology Unit, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Medical Biosciences, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6faa3a08-5546-475d-b0a0-a127be28fc32","ControlNumber":"439","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Paper or electronic FFQ consists of frequencies and portion sizes of foods and beverages. We developed a chatbot-based mobile FFQ, by embedding the validated FFQs in KakaoTalk, Korea&#8217;s most popular mobile messenger. We examined the compatibility of the paper and chatbot-based mobile FFQs in participants who underwent cancer screening endoscopy.<br \/>Method: A total of 50 men and 45 women aged 24 to 79 were recruited from Dongguk University Ilsan Hospital between April and August 2022. Participants underwent gastroscopy or colonoscopy for cancer screening. They completed both the paper and chatbot-based mobile FFQs. Log-transformed intakes of energy and nutrients were compared using the Pearson correlation coefficient. We also calculated the Cohen&#8217;s Kappa coefficients and evaluated Bland-Altman plots and the percent agreement from cross-classification to assess the compatibility.<br \/>Results: The Pearson correlation coefficients of energy and energy-adjusted nutrients ranged from 0.74 (niacin) to 0.90 (vitamin A), and the median of coefficients was 0.85. Cohen&#8217;s kappa coefficient ranged from 0.56 (sodium) to 0.75 (n-6 fatty acid). In the Bland-Altman plots, most data were located between the lower and upper limits of agreement. The percentages of participants classified into the same and adjacent quartiles were between 88% and 98% for energy-adjusted nutrients.<br \/>Conclusions:<b> <\/b>Our study suggests a good compatibility of paper and chatbot-based mobile FFQs. The chatbot-based mobile FFQ may provide comparable intake rankings and be used to evaluate the association between dietary intake and disease risk in longitudinal studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diet,FFQ,Chatbot,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Eui Yeon Lim<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yun Jeong Lim<sup>2<\/sup>, Sang Hoon Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Woongsup Kim<sup>3<\/sup>, Jung Eun Lee<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Food and Nutrition, College of Human Ecology, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Internal Medicine, Dongguk University Ilsan Hospital, Dongguk University College of Medicine, Goyang, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Information Communication Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"18c4b6d0-b5e3-465f-9faf-ff0d6654f27b","ControlNumber":"602","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>E.
