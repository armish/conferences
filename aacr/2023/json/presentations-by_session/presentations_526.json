Recent advances have uncovered numerous cancer intrinsic and tumor-microenvironment mediated mechanisms contributing to ET resistance. However, the predominant mechanisms that prevent cure and ultimately lead to development of terminal metastatic cancer remain unknown. To reveal the leading causes of ET resistance in early-stage ER+ breast cancers, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile serial tumor biopsies from a larger cohort of patients. Patients received either endocrine therapy (letrozole) alone or in combination with a CDK4\/6 cell cycle inhibitor (ribociclib). We examined the evolution of tumor composition, cellular communication, and the phenotypic diversity of tumor-associated cancer and non-cancer cells throughout treatment. Our analyses reveal that ET-resistant tumors are fibroblast- and endothelial-enriched and consistently exhibit broad upregulation of growth factor signaling to cancer cells, with consistent activation of ERBB communication across patient tumors. Fibroblasts emerged as the primary source of these additional growth factor signals. Upregulation of fibroblast growth factor signaling (via NRG1\/2, EGF and IGF) was commensurate with differentiation to a mesenchymal cancer-associated-fibroblast (myCAF) phenotype, which was itself stimulated by cancer cells through EGF and TGF signaling. In response to growth factor enrichment, cancer cells of ET-resistant tumors showed activation of MAPK signal transduction and downstream transcription factors promoting proliferation including FOS, JUN and TRIB1. These results indicate that ET resistance emerges in patient tumors when cancer cells subvert fibroblast function to promote a growth factor enriched tumor microenvironment permitting estrogen independent cancer proliferation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-05 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endocrine resistance,Fibroblasts,Signaling,Growth factor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jason  I.

Yet for many patients these improvements come at the cost of physical and financial toxicity and responses are typically temporary due to emerging drug resistance. A growing body of pre-clinical and clinical work suggests that when cure is unlikely, it is possible to delay progression and reduce drug use through patient-specific drug scheduling. So-called 'adaptive therapy' dynamically adjusts treatment to preserve drug-sensitive cells which interfere with resistant cells through competition. In a prior study, we developed a mathematical model to describe the treatment response of ovarian cancer cells to the PARPi olaparib in vitro, and we proposed a candidate adaptive PARPi algorithm. Here, we extend our model to capture the dynamics in patients and use it to study the feasibility and potential benefit of adaptive PARPi administration in practice.<br \/>Our prior model posited that treatment induces cell cycle arrest that moves cells from the proliferating subset of the population to an arrested compartment. The model predicted that while there is scope for treatment reductions, these need to be carefully timed and prolonged treatment breaks should be avoided. Based on these results we proposed an adaptive treatment algorithm in which the olaparib dose is switched between high and low doses, depending on the tumor&#8217;s growth rate. To test the translational potential of this strategy, we retrospectively collected data from 53 ovarian cancer patients who received olaparib at the H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center between 2014 and 2021. Using serum CA-125 as a proxy for tumor burden, we first examined whether our mathematical model could capture the patients&#8217; longitudinal dynamics. While the response of some patients was consistent with what we had observed in vitro, in others there was evidence of the emergence of a distinct drug-resistant population, and we extended our mathematical model to account for this. After calibrating and validating the model with the patient data, we tested whether these patients would have benefited from adaptive PARPi treatment. Our simulations suggest that our proposed algorithm is feasible and provides a means for reducing treatment in a patient-specific manner. In addition, in a subset of patients we predict that adaptive therapy could delay progression. Overall, this work corroborates the potential for adaptive PARPi therapy and helps to identify outstanding challenges on the way to clinical translation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-05 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Resistance,Tumor evolution,PARP inhibitors,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maximilian  A.

Risk stratification and treatment recommendation are currently based on histopathological and molecular markers, which is challenging due to high inter-observer variability and testing costs respectively. Deep Learning (DL) models can predict prognosis by identifying relevant visual features from H&#38;E whole slide images (WSIs) at different resolutions without prior assumptions. Here, we developed and tested the first interpretable state-of-the-art DL model for WSI-based risk prediction of DR of stage I-III EC (DeREC) from the randomized PORTEC-1\/-2\/-3 trials and three clinical cohorts with long-term follow-up data. We used one representative H&#38;E WSI each from 1761 EC patients, excluding those who received adjuvant chemotherapy as it lowers the risk of DR. We randomly sampled 20% as a held-out internal test set (N=353 with 62 events; 8.45 year median follow-up) and performed a 5-fold cross-validation on the training set (N=1408). WSIs were partitioned into 360 micron patches at 40x magnification. DeREC combined self-supervised representation learning of patches using a multi-resolution vision transformer and a WSI-level graph attention-based time-to-event prediction model. The model performance of correctly ranking patients by predicted risk scores and true time to DR was measured with the concordance-index and compared with a Cox&#8217; Proportional Hazards (CPH) model fitted on histopathological variables (histotype, grade, lymphovascular space invasion, stage). Discriminative quality of the predicted risk groups was investigated with Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test. Most predictive patches by predicted risk groups were reviewed by an expert gynecopathologist for identification of prognostic morphological features. DeREC achieved a concordance-index of 0.764 [95%CI 0.754-0.773] on 5-fold cross validation and 0.757 on the test set, as compared to 0.704 [95%CI 0.662-0.746] with CPH. Predicted risk groups around quartiles 1 and 3 accurately stratified patients between low (N=89), intermediate (N=175), high (N=89) risk of DR (p&#60;0.0001). Among the predicted low-risk group only 3 (3.37%) patients relapsed whereas intermediate and high-risk groups counted 27 (15.43%) and 32 (35.96%) events respectively. DeREC is the first DL model accurately distinguishing EC patients at high risk of DR from those at low risk using one H&#38;E WSI, which would aid decisions on adjuvant treatment. DeREC outperformed standard statistical prediction methods using histopathological variables, indicating that it identified prognostic visual features which can be further investigated. Future development includes the integration of clinicopathological and molecular information.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Histopathology,Prognosis,Endometrial cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sarah Fremond<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sonali Andani<sup>2<\/sup>, Jurriaan Barkey Wolf<sup>1<\/sup>, Gitte Ørtoft<sup>3<\/sup>, Estrid Høgdall<sup>4<\/sup>, Jouke Dijkstra<sup>5<\/sup>, Jan  J.

There has not been any effort to build a multi-source model for the survival analysis of breast cancer. We show in this study a prognostic model, which integrates genetic (DNA), clinical and therapy inputs to predict survival for early breast cancer (stages 1-3) for all breast cancer subtypes.<br \/>Methods: We used a data-driven Random Survival Forest approach, a statistical non-parametric ensemble learning method, that incorporates censor and time-to-event data. The learning is performed by creating numerous decision trees and selecting the model based on the correct responses in unseen data. We used The Cancer Genome Atlas Breast Cancer (TCGA) dataset and observed improvements in the accuracy when more sources of data were used, in line with the previous research. Integrating the impact of non-silent somatic tumor mutations (whole exome) and gene copy number variation (CNV) were analyzed on all mutations and per particular mutation.<br \/>Results: Data from 1096 women with stage 1-3 early breast cancer were inputs to the model n=437 ER+ve HER2-ve, n=123 HER2+ve ER+ve, n=40 HER2+ ER-ve and n=126 TNBC. Pathological stage 1, n=183; stage 2, n=620; and stage 3, n=249. The following chemotherapy and hormonal treatments were used in the analysis: anthracycline, taxanes, platinum, alkylating and anti-metabolite agents, anti-oestrogen, aromatase inhibitors, ovarian suppression and HER2 antibody treatment.<br \/>The model accuracy for predicting survival for early breast cancer using only clinical data was 0.78 for Area Under Curve (AUC) and c-index. The predictive accuracy improved stepwise by adding hormone, genetic and treatment data to AUC of 0.86 and c-index to 0.85. We observed the same trend if the proportion of test data increased from 0.25 to 0.75. Changes in median genes FGFR2 and CDKN2A copy number were strongly prognostic with p=0.0001 and p=0.002, and weaker signals for CBFB p=0.05, HRAS p=0.06, AKT p=0.07.<br \/>Conclusion: Using public datasets, we developed a predictive survival model for an individual with early breast cancer up to 5 years from diagnosis using multi-source and patient-specific data. We show that using this approach for survival analysis yields good accuracy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-01 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Breast cancer,Chemotherapy response,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Aidan (Amanzhol) Kubeyev<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Andrea Giorni<sup>2<\/sup>, Prabu Siva<sup>1<\/sup>, Luiz Silva<sup>2<\/sup>, Jordan Laurie<sup>2<\/sup>, Matthew Foster<sup>2<\/sup>, Matthew Griffiths<sup>1<\/sup>, Uzma Asghar<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Concr, Cambridge, United Kingdom,<sup>2<\/sup>Concr, Brisbane, Australia","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a4908b8a-b382-407c-9c01-af96cc60879d","ControlNumber":"2776","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Novel drug combinations involving immune checkpoint inhibitors are being investigated in clinical trials in NSCLC. In this study, we generated about 450 virtual patients that resembled actual patients with NSCLC and simulated tumor growth during PD-L1 inhibition using a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model.<br \/>Methods: We recalibrated a previously developed QSP model of the cancer-immunity cycle (1) to NSCLC with parameters estimated by published experimental data. Proportions of CD8, CD4, and regulatory T cells (Tregs), M1 and M2 macrophages in lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma were downloaded from iAtlas database and used to calculate the ratios of CD8\/CD4, Tregs\/CD8, and M1\/M2. The three immune subset ratios (observed data) were used to guide the virtual patient generation. We first randomly generated deviations around the baseline model parameters to account for inter-patient variability and then selected virtual patients with model-predicted immune subset ratios statistically matching the observed data. Finally, we simulated tumor growth during PD-L1 inhibition and predicted clinical response in the virtual patient cohort.<br \/>Results: Our model predicted an overall response rate of 16.3% with a 95% bootstrap confidence interval of (11.8, 22.4)% for the overall virtual patient cohort. It also showed that CD8 T cells, PD-L1 expression, CD8\/CD4, CD8\/Tregs, M1\/M2 ratios, and the number of NSCLC-specific T cell clones were significantly higher in responders to PD-L1 inhibition. Furthermore, Tregs\/CD8 and CD8\/CD4 ratios were predicted to be the best predictive biomarkers according to ROC analysis with areas under ROC curve of 0.71 and 0.66.<br \/>Conclusion: Immunogenomic analysis of RNA-seq data on iAtlas allowed generation of realistic virtual patients using QSP models in immuno-oncology. With a virtual patient cohort guided by immunogenomic data, our model provided reliable efficacy prediction for immunotherapy and a tool to identify predictive biomarkers in NSCLC. 1.

A major fallout of these facts is that we have way very high false positive rate leading to too many unnecessary biopsies and their associated costs and emotional burden. We improved our in-house intelligent-augmented Breast cancer RISK calculator (iBRISK), an integrated deep learning (DL) based decision support app and assessed its performance in a multicenter IRB-approved study.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: We improved iBRISK by retraining the DL model with an expanded dataset of 9,700 patient records of clinical risk-factors and mammographic descriptors from Houston Methodist Hospital (HMH) and validated using another 1,078 patient records. These patients were all seen between March 2006 and December 2016. We assessed the model using blinded, independent retrospective BI-RADS 4 patients who had biopsies subsequently after mammography and seen January 2015 - June 2019 at three major healthcare institutions in Texas, USA: MD Anderson Cancer Center, the University of Texas Health Sciences Center at San Antonio, and HMH. We dichotomized and trichotomized the data to evaluate precision of risk stratification and probability of malignancy (POM) estimation translated into biopsy decision augmentation. The iBRISK score as a continuous predictor of malignancy and possible cost savings was also analyzed.<br \/><b><\/b> <b>Results: <\/b>The multicenter validation dataset had 4,209 women, median age (interquartile) was 56 (45, 65) years. The use of iBRISK score as a continuous predictor of malignancy yielded an AUC of 0.97. Among &#8220;low&#8221; and &#8220;moderate&#8221; POM patients, only two out of 1,228 patients (0.16%) and 118 out of 1788 (6.6%) were malignant respectively. This translates to an even better precision when compared to newly introduced BI-RADS 4 subcategories 4A and 4B, with associated PPV3s of 7.6% and 22%, respectively. The &#8220;high&#8221; POM group had a malignancy rate of 85.9% (1,025\/1,193). Estimated potential cost savings in the US was over $260 million.<b><\/b><br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>The<b> <\/b>iBRISK app demonstrated high sensitivity in malignancy prediction and can potentially be used to safely obviate biopsies in up to 50% of patients in low\/moderate POM-groups.

PARP inhibitors (PARPi) suppress the catalytic activity of PARP and trap PARP in a complex with damaged DNA, resulting in the accumulation of unrepaired single-strand breaks (SSBs) and stalled replication forks. Loss of ATR activity blocks cell cycle arrest induced by single-stranded DNA and sensitizes cancer cells to agents that induce DNA replication stress. Thus, PARP inhibition synergizes (through synthetic lethality) with concurrent ATR inhibition by inducing replication fork collapse, double-strand breaks (DSBs), and PARP-DNA complex formation, with simultaneous loss of intra-S and G2\/M checkpoints and suppression of DNA-damage repair, leading to mitotic catastrophe. Four PARPi are currently approved for the treatment of various cancers and several ATR inhibitors (ATRi) are in clinical trials either as monotherapies or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. We developed and validated a semi-mechanistic quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model that represents the mechanisms of action of PARPi and ATRi with minimal parameters, which could be used to inform the optimization of combination regimens.<br \/>Methods: A QSP model of a growing cancer cell population was developed by considering SSBs and DSBs, and parallel DNA repair pathways relying on PARP and ATR. PARPi and ATRi mediated saturable inhibitory effects on their respective DDR pathways, while PARP-DNA trapping was represented as an increased conversion rate from SSBs to DSBs. Phenotypic impairments of the DDR such as BRCA mutations were embedded as DDR pathway deficiencies. The model was calibrated using experimental data derived from rucaparib and talazoparib combination studies with gartisertib.<br \/>Results: The calibrated model captured well the tumor-growth inhibition observed in the HBCx9 PDX model for rucaparib and gartisertib, either alone or in combination, over average daily doses ranging from 50 mg\/kg to 200 mg\/kg (QD\/BID) of rucaparib and 1-3 mg\/kg (QD\/BIW\/QD alternate weeks) of gartisertib. The model was also able to predict the wide range of responses (from shrinkage to progressive disease) observed in a panel of triple-negative breast cancer PDX models (BRCA-mutant and wild type) treated with talazoparib and gartisertib in combination. The complete DDR model utilized 9 variable parameters, and the mechanisms of action of PARP and ATR inhibition were described by 4 parameters each.<br \/>Conclusion: This newly developed QSP model provides a framework that can be applied to optimize the dosing regimens of PARP and ATR inhibitor combinations and help with clinical dosing strategy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-07 Mathematical modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacokinetics,Pharmacodynamics,PARP inhibitors,ATR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Claire  C.
