[{"Abstract":"Background: Cyclin E is post-translationally modified by neutrophil elastase mediated proteolytic cleavage to generate the low molecular weight isoforms of cyclin E (LMW-E) that are detected in various human cancers. We previously reported that 70% of triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) examined overexpress LMW-E, and these patients have a poor prognosis. Expression of LMW-E promotes genomic instability by causing DNA replication stress. PKMYT1 prevents premature mitotic entry by catalyzing CDK1 phosphorylation at T14, essential for preventing DNA damage and cell death when cyclin E, including LMW-E, is overexpressed. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that LMW-E positive status can be used as a biomarker of response in selecting TNBC patients who are likely to respond to RP-6306, a first in-class and selective inhibitor of PKMYT1 kinase.<br \/>Results: Assessment of pre-treatment breast biopsies from TNBC patients (n=40) enrolled in a neoadjuvant chemotherapy prospective study for LMW-E and CDK1-pT14 revealed significant positive correlation between these two proteins. Furthermore, positivity of both biomarkers was associated with lack of pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We next examined the mechanism of response to RP-6306 in vitro and in vivo using TNBC cell lines, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and transgenic mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) models expressing human LMW-E (hLMW-E). In vitro results using 7 different TNBC cell lines, revealed that high LMW-E levels are significantly predictive of response to RP-6306 (R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.78, p= 0.008), while LMW-E knockdown resulted in a 7X increase in IC50 values of RP-6306 (p&#60;0.001). In high LMW-E cells, treatment with RP-6306 resulted in significant (i) downregulation of CDK1-pT14, PKMYT1, WEE1, cyclin B and pRb, (ii) accumulation of sub-G1 and polyploid cell population, (iii) apoptosis, (iv) accumulation of chromosomal breakage, (v) increased DNA damage (increase in &#947;-H2AX and 53BP1 foci\/cell) and lack of DNA repair (downregulation of Rad51), and (vi) premature mitotic entry. Treatment of both breast cancer PDX models and hLMW-E transgenic tumors with RP-6306 revealed that only in animals with high LMW-E tumors, treatment results in significant decrease in tumor volume. However, RP-6306 was ineffective in reducing tumor volume in low cyclin E in vivo models. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that in vivo efficacy of RP-6306 (in both PDX and transgenic models) was concomitant with increase in &#947;-H2AX and decrease in CDK1-pT14 and Ki67.<br \/>Conclusion: Collectively, our results show that overexpression of LMW-E and CDK1-pT14 in TNBC can be used to stratify patients whose tumors are likely to respond to RP-6306. Mechanistically, LMW-E overexpressing TNBC cells activate CDK1 (<i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>) to accelerate premature mitotic entry, leading to DNA damage and apoptosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cyclin E,DNA damage,PKMYT1 inhibitor-RP-6306,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Amriti Lulla<sup>1<\/sup>, Tuyen  D.

The prediction for pathCR would provide an important guidance for decision making regarding surgical strategy. Previous studies have used the logistic regression model to predict pathCR, however, few studies utilized the machine learning models. In this study, we aimed to establish a predictive model for pathCR using the machine learning models using clinical data in patients with GEJ cancer treated by trimodality therapy. Methods: 512 patients with localized esophageal and GEJ adenocarcinoma who received trimodality therapy in MD Anderson Cancer Center between 2002 to 2020 were included. We first performed survival analysis to confirm the survival benefit of pathCR. Then, several prediction models commonly used in machine learning, including logistic regression, LASSO, Random Forest, BART, and xgboost were used to predict pathCR. Each method was trained and validated using 10-fold cross-validation. Results: A total of 125 patients (24 %) achieved a path CR. Patients who achieved path CR had significantly longer overall survival (OS) and relapse free survival (RFS) than &#60;pathCR 387 patients (76%) (median OS, 132 months vs 58 months, respectively, p &#60; 0.002; median RFS, 63 months vs 27 months, respectively, p &#60; 0.001). The logistic regression model indicated non-signet ring cell subtype, T1\/T2 stage, negative biopsy after chemoradiation were independent predictive factors for pathCR. Finally, we created machine learning models and LASSO showing the highest predictive ability with AUC value of 0.644 among those models including conventional logistic regression model. The percent partial AUC at lower false positive rate of 0.25 was higher than that of the conventional logistic regression model (% pAUC, 23.7 vs 21.8, respectively) Conclusion: We established the clinical predictive model for pathCR in patients with GEJ cancer treated by trimodality therapy using machine learning method with acceptable predictive ability. Addition of molecular features might further refine the models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Predictive biomarkers,Machine learning,Response,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kohei Yamashita<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jacob  M.

The treatment regimen for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has drastically changed owing to the superior anti-cancer effects of immunotherapies. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and chemo-immunotherapy (chemo-ICI) are the first-line treatments for NSCLC. Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) and PD-L1 expression in tumor cells are potential biomarkers in predicting a patient&#8217;s survival and response to ICI. However, emerging data have shown that TMB and PD-L1 may no longer be an adequate biomarkers in predicting a patient&#8217;s response to ICI or chemo-ICI. We hypothesize that by using tumor-sequencing data and taking into effect a patient&#8217;s smoking status, we can identify biomarkers that predict survival to either ICI or chemo-ICI.<br \/>Methods: To identify biomarkers, we collected genomic sequencing data and comprehensive clinical characteristics on 424 NSCLC patients who received ICI or chemo-ICI treatment at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist. Cox-proportional hazard regression models were fit to identify mutations that were &#8220;beneficial&#8221; (HR &#60; 1) or &#8220;detrimental&#8221; (HR &#62; 1) for patients on different treatment regimens, followed by the generation of mutation composite scores (MCS) for each treatment. Co-occurrence analysis was performed to identify novel co-occurring and mutually exclusive mutations in each treatment and smoking group by mutation interaction analysis.<br \/>Results: We identify beneficial and harmful mutations in patients that received ICI or chemo-ICI treatment. We also identified unique biomarkers based on smoking statues.

OMX-0407, an orally available, single-digit nanomolar inhibitor of SIK3 was shown to inhibit tumor growth in a distinct panel of tumor models <i>in vitro<\/i> as well as <i>in vivo <\/i>by decreasing downstream pro-survival signaling of SIK3, enhancing caspase-mediated apoptosis and repolarizing the tumor microenvironment by decreasing regulatory T cells.<br \/>In a comprehensive viability screening, more than 200 murine and human cancer cell lines and patient derived tumor models of different indications were used to identify a distinct subset of cancers highly sensitive towards OMX-0407. Representative for these tumors, OMX-0407 demonstrated dose-dependent anti-tumor efficacy in the renal cell carcinoma model RENCA, the squamous non-small cell lung cancer model (sqNSCLC) KLN205 and the murine colorectal tumor model MC38. With significantly prolonged overall survival of more than 60% tumor growth inhibition in all tumor models, OMX-0407 demonstrated equivalent or superior efficacy compared to anti-PD-1 monotherapy. In addition, OMX-0407 enhances the therapeutic potential of the standard of care chemotherapy in a broad range of human cancer cells and murine tumor models of sqNSCLC.<br \/>Using comprehensive transcriptomics and proteomics analyses the selective activity profile of OMX-0407 on individual cancer cell lines and PDX models was used to identify and validate a predictive biomarker signature. With this gene signature, 84% of the selected cancer cells lines are correctly classified and would benefit from OMX-0407 therapy. The predictive biomarker will be evaluated in the clinical Phase I trial of OMX-0407 scheduled to start enrollment shortly.<br \/>In summary, OMX-0407, a first-in-class oral SIK3 inhibitor, demonstrates potent monotherapy efficacy in tumor indications with high unmet medical need equal or superior to anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade. By screening sensitive and non-sensitive tumor cell lines and PDX models, we identified a response-prediction biomarker signature. In upcoming clinical studies, this predictive biomarker signature will be evaluated for it&#8217;s potential to enrich for patients highly responsive to OMX-0407 therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Predictive biomarkers,Gene expression profiling,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ilona-Petra Maser<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sonja Lacher<sup>1<\/sup>, Vincent Piras<sup>2<\/sup>, Barbara Kracher<sup>3<\/sup>, Kai Zanziger<sup>1<\/sup>, Murray Yule<sup>1<\/sup>, Hannes Loferer<sup>1<\/sup>, Stefan Bissinger<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Preclinical Pharmacology and biomarker development, iOmx Therapeutics AG, Munich, Germany,<sup>2<\/sup>Evotec SAS, Toulouse, France,<sup>3<\/sup>Evotec GmbH, Munich, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2186adce-719d-4239-bd6b-33f8b5f81845","ControlNumber":"4725","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>I.

Over the past decade, EC outcomes have worsened in the United States, despite the fact that early stage, well-differentiated cancers are often cured by simple hysterectomy. Work by the Cancer Genome Atlas Consortium (TCGA) and others has stratified EC patients by four genomically-defined subtypes: POLE ultramutated, microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) hypermutated, copy-number low (CNV-L), and copy-number high (CNV-H). These subtypes not only correlate with clinical outcome but also, in specific instances, response to targeted agents such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). By integrating genomic and proteomic data, our recent study with the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) built upon findings from the TCGA, specifically identifying immunologic subtypes which differentiate tumors based on their overall mutation burdens and antigen processing machinery (APM) profiles. Despite this progress, effective treatments for advanced stage, metastatic and\/or recurrent disease are often lacking. Thus, a better understanding of how EC subtypes can be efficiently identified and targeted to improve their outcomes is urgently needed. Here, we present the results of a comprehensive proteogenomic analysis of a new prospectively curated set of 138 EC tumors and 20 specimens enriched for normal endometrium. We also evaluated the utility of a novel machine learning algorithm for parsing clinically-relevant genomic features based solely on images from Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&#38;E) stained cross-sections. Our integrative multi-omic analyses examined the diverse dimensions of molecular pathways to better describe diagnostic and therapeutic targets. From our targeted proteomic assay, we describe a model that uses two peptides to accurately predict tumor APM status. Using gene expression and clinical data, we observed an association between lower Myc activity and Metformin usage in our patients with diabetes. Linking genomics, proteomics, and phospho-proteomics, we uncovered an upregulation of AKT-pT308 in tumors with PIK3R1 in-frame indels. Multi-omic clustering revealed a subset of CNV-L tumors enriched for &#223;-catenin hotspot mutations, which have elevated Wnt signaling due to impaired &#223;-catenin degradation signals. Lastly, we observe a subset of MSI-H tumors with a gain of chromosome 1q that show lowered immune infiltration. Analysis of this independent cohort, incorporating published EC tumor and cell line cohorts, has not only confirmed findings from our recent exploratory study but also provided new biological insights relevant to potential therapeutic strategies. These findings can be further investigated to guide patient stratification for improved precision treatment of EC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,Proteomics,Tumor biology,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lizabeth Katsnelson<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yongchao Dou<sup>2<\/sup>, Marina  A.

However, eligibility and response rates remain limited in many cases, calling for better predictive biomarkers.<br \/>Methods: We present ENLIGHT, a transcriptomics-based computational approach that identifies clinically relevant genetic interactions and uses them to predict a patient&#8217;s response to a variety of therapies in multiple cancer types, importantly, without training on previous treatment response data. Consequently, in addition to its ability to predict patients' response to approved and well-studied therapies, ENLIGHT can predict the response to new treatments in early development, even before clinical data has accumulated. Accordingly, we study ENLIGHT in two translationally relevant scenarios: Personalized Oncology (PO), aimed at prioritizing approved treatments to a given patient, and Clinical Trial Design (CTD), selecting the subset of most likely responders in a patient cohort.<br \/>Results: Evaluating ENLIGHT&#8217;s performance on 21 blinded clinical trial datasets spanning 11 indications and 15 different drugs in the PO setting, we show that it can effectively predict a patient&#8217;s treatment response across multiple therapies and cancer types, with an overall odds ratio of 2.59 (p=3.41e-8), and a 36% increase in response rate over the baseline (p=3.30e-13). Its prediction accuracy is better than other state-of-the-art transcriptomics-based signatures. Unlike most signatures that are prognostic or provide insights for only very few, specific treatments, ENLIGHT provides matching scores to a broad range of treatments. Quite strikingly, its performance is comparable to that of supervised predictors developed for specific indications and drugs. In combination with the IFN-&#947; signature, ENLIGHT achieves an odds ratio larger than 4 in predicting response to immune checkpoint therapy. In the CTD scenario, our results show that by excluding non-responders ENLIGHT can enhance clinical trial success for immunotherapies and other monoclonal antibodies, achieving &#62; 90% of the response rate attainable under an optimal exclusion strategy.<br \/>Conclusion: ENLIGHT is a powerful transcriptomics-based precision oncology pipeline developed by Pangea Biomed that broadly predicts response to both extant and novel targeted and immune therapies, going beyond context-specific biomarkers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Personalized medicine,Predictive biomarkers,mRNA,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Gal Dinstag<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Eldad  D.

Preclinical data indicate that TGF-&#946; pathway activity mediates immune evasion by tumor T cell exclusion and may therefore be predictive for response. Recently, a new mRNA-based methodology has been developed to measure and quantify signal transduction pathway (STP) activities in tissue. This study was initiated to characterize the STPs in advanced melanoma samples to better understand the role of STPs in immune check point efficacy.<br \/>Method: The OncoSIGNal pathway activity profiling PCR test (InnoSIGN) was used to measure the activity of 8 different STPs (AR, PI3K, MAPK, Hedgehog (HH), TGF-&#946;, Notch, NFkB and JAK-STAT1\/2) in biopsies (FFPE) from patients with advanced melanoma (n=34) and expressed on a scale from 0 -100. A biopsy of a metastatic site was obtained prior start of ICI therapy (nivolumab or pembrolizumab). These samples were analyzed for STP activity and related to progression-free survival (PFS). Also, STP activities were compared between responders (n=15; partial or complete response) and non-responders (n=19; defined as progression within 6 months).<br \/>Results: The mean HH score of responders versus non-responders was 35.7 <u>+<\/u> 6.1 vs 41.6 <u>+<\/u> 8.7 (p=0.038), while TGF-&#946; scores were 53.9 <u>+<\/u> 6.2 vs 56.8 <u>+<\/u> 8.2 (p=0.265), respectively. Cox regression analysis showed a hazard ratio of 1-1.1 for PFS of both HH and TGF-&#946; (HH: p=0.032) (TGF-&#946;: p=0.071). Kaplan Meier curves indicated a better PFS for lower HH activity at a threshold of 46 (p&#60; 0.001) and lower MAPK activity at a threshold of 47.3 (p= 0.041). No relation with PFS was detected for TGF-&#946; activity. No statistically significant differences were observed in STP activity between different metastatic locations ((sub)cutaneous, lymph node or visceral metastases).<br \/>Conclusion: Signal transduction pathway activity of metastatic samples, taken prior start of ICI therapy, from patients with advanced melanoma, suggest that TGF-&#946; did not correlate with response nor PFS but increased HH and MAPK STP activity may relate towards a worse PFS from ICI therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Signal transduction pathways,Metastatic tumors,Hedgehog,TGF-&#946;,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Stefan  G.  vanRavensteijn<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Daniele  V.

We previously demonstrated safety and activity of GD2.41BB.z chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-Ts) at dose level 1, 1x10<sup>6<\/sup> GD2 CAR-T\/kg (Majzner\/Ramakrishna et al. Nature 2022) and reported results of dose level 2, 3x10<sup>6<\/sup> GD2 CAR-T\/kg (Majzner et al. AACR 2022). Here, we present in depth high-dimensional analyses to define the immune states that contribute to CAR-T activity in patients.<br \/>Methods: Thirteen patients (10 DIPG\/3 spinal DMG; 4-30 years old; 7F\/6M) were enrolled in this GD2 CAR-T phase 1 clinical trial (NCT04196413). GD2 CAR-Ts were administered to 12\/13 enrolled patients. In the first cohort, CAR-Ts were administered initially intravenously (IV), followed by serial intracerebroventricular infusions (ICV; range 0-11 infusions\/patient). Patient GD2 CAR-T product, peripheral blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were evaluated for CAR-T expansion (qPCR; flow cytometry), cytokine signatures (Multiplex Luminex), and immune cell profiles (single cell RNA-sequencing). Data were analyzed in the context of clinical trajectory and patient response.<br \/>Results: 10\/12 infused subjects demonstrated clinical and\/or radiographic benefit, with less systemic toxicity following ICV compared to IV infusion. CAR-T expansion was noted in the periphery and CSF of all treated patients and following serial ICV infusions. In peripheral blood, cytokine concentrations, including IFN-gamma, IL6, and CXCL9, were higher after IV compared to ICV CAR-T infusions, correlating with increased systemic inflammation. Conversely in CSF, cytokine concentrations, such as CCL2 and CXCL9, were higher following ICV compared to IV CAR-T infusions. Transcriptomic analysis was conducted on 576,199 single cells from 91 samples, including GD2 CAR-T products and patient CSF. This is the largest CAR-T dataset in CNS tumors. Patient CSF samples were dominated by T cell and myeloid populations. After IV CAR-T infusion, patient CSF exhibited an increased fraction of regulatory T cells and suppressive myeloid populations from baseline. These immune suppressive cells reduced after ICV infusion. Ongoing analyses are underway to explore the relation of these immune populations to patient response.<br \/>Conclusions: H3K27M-mutated DIPG\/DMG patients demonstrate continued clinical response with serial ICV GD2 CAR-T infusions, with heterogeneity in the durability of response across patients. In-depth correlative analyses profile distinct immune populations and demonstrate population shifts depending on route of administration and over the course of treatment. Key findings from these data will allow for iterative improvement in CAR-T therapies for H3K27M+ DIPG\/DMG patients, providing hope to shift the paradigm of this fatal disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Biomarkers,Pediatric cancers,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sneha Ramakrishna<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Zinaida Good<sup>1<\/sup>, Moksha Desai<sup>1<\/sup>, Daniel Zamler<sup>1<\/sup>, Rebecca Mancusi<sup>1<\/sup>, Jasia Mahdi<sup>1<\/sup>, Robbie Majzner<sup>1<\/sup>, Liora Schultz<sup>1<\/sup>, Rebecca Richards<sup>2<\/sup>, Jennifer Kamens<sup>1<\/sup>, Valentin Barsan<sup>1<\/sup>, Cynthia Campen<sup>1<\/sup>, Sonia Partap<sup>1<\/sup>, Zachary Ehlinger<sup>1<\/sup>, Warren Reynolds<sup>1<\/sup>, Yiyun Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Mark  P.

Sacituzumab govitecan (SG), targeting Trop-2, is approved for metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC); and trastuzumab deruxtecan, targeting HER2, is approved for HER2-positive and HER2-low metastatic breast cancer. To understand the potentially overlapping clinical landscape of Trop-2 and HER2 antigens, we evaluated RNA expression data in breast cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>TCGA dataset was assessed for Trop-2 and HER2 expression via processed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of the corresponding genes <i>TACSTD2<\/i> and <i>ERBB2<\/i>. Medium\/high gene expression was assessed as &#62;100 transcripts per million (TPM). Samples were classified HER2-low per ASCO\/CAP guidelines. Gene expression across clinical parameters was assessed via one-way ANOVA.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>1076 patients with primary breast cancer were included. The majority (59%) had both high <i>TACSTD2<\/i> expression (<i>TACSTD2<\/i><sup>hi<\/sup>) and high <i>ERBB2 <\/i>expression (<i>ERBB2<sup>hi<\/sup>)<\/i> (see <b>Table<\/b>). Median <i>TACSTD2<\/i> expression was 572 TPM (IQR 349-666 TPM); median <i>ERBB2 <\/i>expression was 122 TPM (IQR 73-192 TPM). No significant difference was observed in <i>TACSTD2 <\/i>or <i>ERBB2<\/i> expression among invasive ductal carcinoma, invasive lobular carcinoma, mixed histology, or other (p = 0.07, 0.23). No significant difference in <i>TACSTD2<\/i> expression was noted between HER2-low and HER2-negative subtypes (p=0.34).<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b> While SG is approved in TNBC, <i>TACSTD2<\/i> is expressed across all breast cancer subtypes, including HER2-low, suggesting a broader population may benefit from Trop-2-targeted ADCs. Furthermore, given that over half of breast cancers have high expression of both <i>TACSTD2<\/i> and <i>ERBB2<\/i>, additional studies are needed to understand the optimal sequencing of ADC-based therapies for patients with breast cancer.<table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{ACFD54A0-E10A-4F57-AE38-08FA399CE4AD}\"><caption class=\"AbstractTableCaption\"><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Patient subsets<\/b>(HR = hormone receptor)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>n<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b><i>TACSTD2<\/i><sup>hi<\/sup> &#38;

Much remains unknown about the frequency of HER2-low (IHC 1+ or 2+) expression and the change of HER2 status from primary to metastatic tumor samples. There is limited data available about the HER2-low frequency in solid tumors beyond breast and gastric\/gastroesophageal (GEJ) cancer.<br \/>Methods: HER2 IHC was performed in 923 patients (pts) with metastatic breast and 51 pts with gastric\/GEJ cancers in CLIA-certified labs. We evaluated the HER2 IHC in paired primary and metastatic samples in breast cancer. We also assessed the HER2 status in non-breast, non-gastric\/GEJ histologies. In available cases, concurrent HER2 genomic alterations were evaluated.<br \/>Results: A total of 867 pts with breast cancer had a definitive HER2 IHC score for their metastatic sample: 101 pts (11.6%) were 3+, 171 pts (19.7%) were 2+, 252 pts (29%) were 1+ and 343 (39.6%) had no HER2 expression. The HER2 IHC scores in metastatic samples as compared to primary was in concordance in 54.9% of cases, while HER2 3+ remained unchanged in 87.2%, kappa=0.85 with a 95% CI = (0.79, 0.91). In 48 cases with metastatic gastric\/GEJ cancer, HER2 was: 3+ in 2 pts (4.2%), 2+ in 5 pts (10.4%), 1+ in 9 pts (18.8%) and 32 (66.7%) had no HER2 expression. In non-breast and non-gastric\/GEJ cancers, HER2-low was found in 631 pts (33.5%) as shown in the table below. A total of 1,552 pts who had HER2 IHC also had genomic testing: 36 had HER2 activating mutations, 48 had HER2 amplification (amp) and 3 had HER2 amp and mutations. 22 of 33 pts with HER2 mutations (without amp) had HER2 IHC expression: 10 pts (30%) were 1+, 10 (30%) were 2+ and 2 (6%) were 3+.<br \/>Conclusion: Our results show that HER2-low expression is frequently found across tumor types and HER2 activating mutations are enriched in cancers where HER2 is expressed. These findings suggest that a high number of pts with solid tumors with HER2-low expression could potentially benefit from HER2 directed therapies.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\"

Like other breast cancer (BC) types, TNBC cells are also dependent on oncodrivers that potentiate the malignancy by inducing proliferation. This dependency makes oncodrivers the target of choice for new BC therapies. Here, we focus on cellular distribution of HER3, EGFR, and MET in TNBC tumors. Analysis of oncodrivers expression along with immune cell landscape in TNBC tumors pre- and post-chemotherapy will help in understanding the interaction between immune response and oncodrivers status and how that correlates with therapeutic response(s) in patients to design future clinical trial using targeted immunotherapy.Methods: In an IRB-approved study, immunohistochemistry was performed using tissue microarray (TMA) on surgical blocks from a cohort of 90 TNBC patients. Two separate multiplex panels: (1) Oncodrivers (HER3, EGFR &#38; MET); (2) Immune cells (CD4, CD8, CD20, CD56, CD45, &#38; PD1) were used. Subsequently, oncodrivers expression was correlated to immune infiltration, clinical responses, and survival by reviewing the pathological data.<br \/>Results: We analyzed total 208 QC-passed TMA cores. Irrespective of clinical outcome, EGFR (41.13% vs 15.09%, p&#60;0.0001) and MET (35.67% vs 11.61%, p&#60;0.0001) showed increase in the number of positive cells in tumor as compared to benign tissue. Curiously, limited expression of HER3 was significantly lower in stromal tissue (1.62% vs 0.59%, p=0.026). The distribution of MET and EGFR showed a significant correlation (r=0.32, p&#60;0.0001) whereas HER3 expression was mutually exclusive to either MET (r=-0.006, p=0.931) or EGFR (r=-0.07, p=0.291). Analysis of clinical and pathological data demonstrated that HER3 expression was higher in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (2.95% versus 0.79%, p=0.004). There was higher expression of HER3 in node positive disease (p=0.013) and MET in node negative disease (p=0.004). There was no change in expression between pre- and post-chemotherapy samples for MET (p=0.097) and EGFR (p=0.754). Interestingly, the intermediate strength of EGFR expression was significantly associated with favorable overall survival in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (univariate Cox model, N=13, HR=0.28, p=0.024). Analysis of immune infiltrate showed a significant correlation between CD45 and EGFR (r=0.379, p&#60;0.001) as well as MET (r=0.443, p&#60;0.001).<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>EGFR and MET overexpressed in tumor tissue of TNBC specimens while smaller proportion of HER3+ cells were limited to tumor as compared to stroma. HER3 appears to be altered by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. EGFR and MET expression correlated with CD45+ immune cells. To this end, HER3, EGFR, and MET remain viable options as potential targets for dendritic cell tumor vaccines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Oncodrivers,Expression profiling,Dendritic cell vaccines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Saurabh  K.

We sought to understand the clinical impact of <i>MTAP<\/i> status on treatment and survival outcomes, in a clinical cohort of molecularly characterized advanced cholangiocarcinoma patients.<br \/>Methods: We analyzed advanced cholangiocarcinoma patients treated and evaluated at MD Anderson Cancer Center, tested for <i>MTAP<\/i>. Clinical information including genomic co-alterations, demographic information, treatment history and response to treatment were retrieved from retrospective medical record review. Comprehensive genomic profiling was performed with FDA-approved assays. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS24 using Fisher's exact test, multivariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meyer method for survival analysis.<br \/>Results: 71 patients were identified (<i>MTAP<\/i> loss 31% (22\/71); <i>MTAP<\/i> intact 69% (49\/71)); 54,9% (39\/71) were females. No significant difference in gender, age or ethnicity was seen between <i>MTAP<\/i> cohorts.<br \/>We found that altered <i>CDKN2A<\/i> (p&#60;0.01), <i>CDKN2B<\/i> (p&#60;0.01), and <i>IDH1<\/i> (p=0.048) were highly correlated with <i>MTAP<\/i> loss, while <i>STK11<\/i> (p=0.095), a prognostic indicator of IO resistance, also showed a tendency to be a surrogate marker of <i>MTAP<\/i> loss status. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was lower in <i>MTAP<\/i> loss group (2.18 vs. 4.88, p &#60;0.01), but no difference was found in microsatellite instability (MSI) or PD-L1 status between groups.<br \/>On multivariate analysis, patients harboring <i>CDKN2A<\/i> loss were noted to have worse OS compared to those without <i>CDKN2A<\/i> intact (18.6 vs 29.9 months, 95% CI, p=0.035). No statistically significant difference in OS was observed by <i>MTAP<\/i> status (25.9 vs. 29.2 months, 95% CI, p=0.168). Other genomic alterations with significant impact on OS were <i>CCNE1<\/i> (p&#60;0.01), <i>FGF19<\/i> (p=0.04), and <i>MYC<\/i> (p=0.043).<br \/>Treatment with chemotherapy regimens containing Gemcitabine in the first line setting of metastatic disease showed higher disease control rate in the <i>MTAP<\/i> intact cohort (91.4%) vs. <i>MTAP<\/i> loss cohort (38.5%) (p&#60;0.01), but no statistically significant difference in response (PR\/CR) (p=0.421). Few patients (14\/71) received IO in this cohort; no significant difference in IO response was observed by <i>MTAP<\/i> status (p=0.152).<br \/>Conclusions: <i>MTAP<\/i> loss cholangiocarcinoma has a distinct molecular profile compared with <i>MTAP<\/i> intact including key differences in co-altered tumor suppressor genes and TMB. To our knowledge, this is the first real-world data describing the clinical and genomic differences in advanced cholangiocarcinoma by <i>MTAP<\/i> status. Further prospective data are required to validate these<br \/>findings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cholangiocarcinoma,Gene profiling,Biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Cátia  F.

Biomarkers to identify patients at risk for early progression on ICI-mono or those who would maximally benefit from upfront ICI-chemo have not been defined.<br \/>Methods: We queried the GEMINI database to identify metastatic NSCLC patients without targetable <i>EGFR\/ALK<\/i> alterations who were treated with ICI-mono or ICI-chemo. Mutational profiling was performed on tissue or blood using targeted NGS. Outcome measures were defined as clinical progression free survival (PFS) or early progressive disease (PD) rate (defined as rate of 3-month progression), and their association with variables was assessed via Cox Proportional Hazards regression (PFS) or logistic regression (early PD). Predictive deep learning models were used to integrate clinicopathological factors and genomic profile.<br \/>Results: 735 patients were included in this study, 269 treated with ICI-chemo and 466 with ICI-mono; 446 were treated in the first-line setting. <i>TP53<\/i> was the most frequently altered gene (60%), followed by <i>KRAS<\/i> (37%), <i>AR<\/i> (21%), and <i>STK11<\/i> (19%). In ICI-mono patients, alterations in <i>STK11<\/i>, <i>ERBB2<\/i>, <i>ARID1A<\/i> and <i>CDK6<\/i> were associated with a higher likelihood of early PD; only <i>STK11<\/i> was associated with early PD (29% vs 17%, <i>P<\/i> = 0.04) on ICI-chemo. In all patients, low PD-L1 expression and high disease burden (stage IVb and liver metastases) associated with early PD, but there were borderline significant treatment effects in favor of ICI-chemo in never smokers and patients with liver metastases and stage IVb. Shorter PFS was observed in the ICI-chemo group who had <i>CDKN2A <\/i>alterations vs wild type (median PFS: 5.1 vs 9.0 months; HR: 1.72; <i>P<\/i> = 0.01). A subgroup analysis of patients with <i>CDKN2A<\/i> alterations demonstrated preferentially worse outcomes in ICI-chemo compared to ICI-mono, with the best PFS achieved in the ICI-mono treated patients with <i>CDKN2A<\/i> point mutation. Integration of clinicogenomic features into a multivariate model with feature selection to predict early PD demonstrated a predictive performance of AUC 0.73 (vs PD-L1 alone, AUC 0.60) in the ICI-mono group, driven by liver metastases, stage IVb disease, PD-L1 expression, and <i>STK11<\/i> alterations. These features were less predictive in ICI-chemo-treated patients, indicating a protective effect against early PD in these patients from combination chemoimmunotherapy.<br \/>Conclusions: Low PD-L1, high disease burden, and <i>STK11<\/i> alterations are markers of early PD on ICI-mono, and patients with these features may particularly benefit from upfront combination treatment with ICI-chemo to protect against early progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Immunotherapy,Genomics,Predictive biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lingzhi Hong<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Muhammad Aminu<sup><\/sup>, Xuetao Lu<sup><\/sup>, Maliazurina  B.

Further, while combination ICB has higher response rates and improved progression-free survival compared to single-agent therapy in the front-line setting, there is significantly increased toxicity with combination ICB, and biomarkers to identify patients who would disproportionately benefit from combination therapy vs aPD-1 ICB are poorly characterized. <b>Methods: <\/b>To understand resistance mechanisms to ICB therapy, we analyzed whole-exome-sequencing (WES) of pre-treatment tumor and matched normal tissue from 4 cohorts of previously ICB-na&#239;ve, aPD-1 treated patients (n=140). The SKCM TCGA cohort (from a pre-immuno- and targeted-therapy time period) was used for comparison to understand the prognostic and predictive role of the features identified. We then developed a parsimonious predictive model to identify patients with intrinsic resistance (PD as BOR) on aPD1 treatment with high specificity. Finally, we analyzed two additional independent cohorts to validate the model and to test whether patients predicted to have intrinsic resistance to single-agent aPD-1 may respond to combination ICB. <b>Results: <\/b>We found that high intratumoral genomic heterogeneity and low ploidy robustly identified patients with intrinsic resistance to aPD-1 within and across each independent cohort. Compared to the TCGA SKCM (&#8220;untreated&#8221; cohort), genomic heterogeneity specifically predicted response (Mann-Whitney p=0.018) and survival (multivariate Cox log rank p=0.002) in the ICB treated cohorts, but not in the untreated cohort, while ploidy was prognostic of overall survival in the &#8220;untreated&#8221; (by targeted therapy or ICB) group. (log-rank p=0.01). To establish clinically actionable predictions, we optimized a simple decision tree using genomic ploidy and heterogeneity and identified with high confidence a subset of patients with intrinsic resistance (PPV=90%) and significantly worse survival on aPD1 treatment (optimized decision tree OS log-rank p&#60;0.001; PFS log-rank p&#60;0.001). We then validated this model in a set of independent cohorts, and further demonstrate that these features and predictions of the model are independent of known clinical features and previously reported molecular biomarkers associated with poor-risk disease or poor response to ICB. Finally, in an additional cohort, we found that a significant proportion of patients predicted to have intrinsic resistance to single agent aPD-1 responded to combination aPD1+aCTLA4. <b>Conclusions:<\/b> These findings nominate the clinical and biological importance of genomic heterogeneity and ploidy, and sets a concrete framework towards clinical actionability, broadly advancing precision medicine in oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Predictive biomarkers,Immune checkpoint blockade,Therapy resistance,Heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Giuseppe Tarantino<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Cora A.

Pre-specified analyses identified associations of <i>BRCA1\/2 <\/i>mutation status and genomic LOH (gLOH) with prolonged PFS. Recently, a novel scar-based measure of HRD was described [HRDsig; AACR #1249], and we retrospectively examined its predictive value in the ARIEL2 study.<br \/>Methods: ARIEL2 (CO-338-017; NCT01891344) was an international multicenter, two-part, phase 2 open-label study conducted across 64 sites. Tumor tissues were profiled with comprehensive genomic profiling for all classes of alterations in at least 287 genes (FoundationOne&#174;). HRDsig was called using a machine learning based algorithm with a broad set of genome-wide copy number and short variant features, independent of gLOH (AACR 2022 #1249). Survival analysis was limited to samples where both gLOH and HRDsig could be evaluated (n=394). Hazard ratios were estimated using a univariate Cox proportional hazards model and objective response rates (ORR) were compared using Fisher&#8217;s exact test. gLOH high was defined using a cutoff of 16%, based on ARIEL2 and subsequently FDA approved as a complementary diagnostic. <i>BRCA1<\/i> promoter methylation was quantified by digital droplet PCR.<br \/>Results: HRDsig(+) was identified in 56% (251\/449) of cases, including 92% (108\/117) of those with deleterious <i>BRCA1\/2 <\/i>alterations and 43% (143\/332) of <i>BRCA<\/i>wt. In the intention to treat (ITT) and in pts with platinum sensitive (plat-sen) disease, HRDsig(+) was predictive of PFS benefit on rucaparib (ITT HR = 0.63 [0.50-0.80], p&#60;0.001; plat-sen HR = 0.44 [0.32-0.60]; p&#60;0.001), similar to gLOH-high (ITT HR = 0.70 [0.56-0.87], p=0.0016; plat-sen HR 0.55 [0.41-0.74], p&#60;0.001). In <i>BRCA<\/i>wt pts with plat-sen disease (n=179), HRDsig was predictive of objective response and PFS on rucaparib, (ORR 28% in HRDsig(+) vs 10% in HRDsig(-), p=0.002; PFS HR = 0.66 [0.48-0.91]; p=0.012). Tumors with <i>RAD51C\/D <\/i>alterations (5\/5; 100%) were identified as HRDsig(+). Most other HRR alterations showed little association with HRDsig, including ATM (0\/5 HRDsig(+)), and CHEK2 (0\/4 HRDsig(+)). Additionally, 33 <i>BRCA<\/i>wt pts were identified as <i>BRCA1 <\/i>methylation positive in the cohort, with 32\/33 (97%) identified as HRDsig(+), similar to gLOH-high (30\/33; 91%).<br \/>Conclusions: HRDsig(+) was associated with rucaparib benefit overall and in <i>BRCA<\/i>wt pts with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer in this study. HRDsig(+) status exhibited strong association with deficiency caused by both epigenetic (<i>BRCA1 <\/i>methylation) and genetic (HRR mutation) mechanisms. Additional studies should further explore the utility of this biomarker for pt selection in ovarian cancer and other relevant cancer types to inform the use of PARP inhibitors or other DNA damaging agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Homologous recombination,PARP inhibitors,Genomic instability,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ethan  S.

There is a need to explore the clinical relevance of these biomarkers as continuous variables. This is particularly relevant for the new class of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), in which a relatively low HER2 expression level is adequate for targeting tumor cells. We explored the potential of RNA profiling, determined by next generation sequencing (NGS), to provide more flexible clinical biomarkers as compared with immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).<br \/>Methods: Clinical and laboratory data from 57 breast cancers collected by the COTA real-world data company were used to study biomarker levels as detected by routine clinical transcriptomic tests . HER2 (<i>ERBB2<\/i>), estrogen receptor alpha (<i>ESR1<\/i>), and androgen receptor (<i>AR<\/i>) mRNA levels were compared with reported HER2 and estrogen receptor (ER) IHC and FISH results.<br \/>Results: RNA levels accurately reflected and predicted HER2 amplification (see table below). Importantly, RNA data showed significant variation and overlap in the levels of <i>ERBB2<\/i> mRNA between cases scored by IHC as zero, 1+, and 2+. This variation correlated with progression-free survival (PFS). Similarly, the <i>ESR1<\/i> RNA levels accurately reflected ER status and demonstrated significant variation between positive cases. RNA data also showed significant variations in the AR levels. Patients with high <i>AR<\/i> mRNA levels had significantly better PFS (P=0.05). Patients expressing high <i>ER<\/i> and <i>AR<\/i> levels had significantly better PFS than those expressing low <i>ESR1<\/i> and <i>AR<\/i> levels (P=0.03).<br \/>Conclusions: These findings suggest that RNA analysis using NGS is an alternative to IHC and FISH. RNA provides continuous data that can determine cut-off points predicting response to therapy and should be explored in predicting ADC response.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{C6D8685D-7AF1-420A-9E3C-12D6948B540D}\"><caption>ERBB2 mRNA levels (FPKM) in various HER2 IHC groups<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>IHC Score<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;line-height:107%;

Interest has now turned toward defining a sub-population of IHC 0+ tumors that may have HER2 expression below the limit of IHC detection\/quantification and may thus also be responsive. We previously validated a high dynamic range HER2 RNA expression assay run as part of our comprehensive genomic profiling test, StrataNGS.<br \/>Herein, we evaluated the HER2 RNA expression data together with copy number and clinical outcome data from the Strata Clinical Molecular Database (SCMD) in advanced breast cancer (n = 3,063) and other advanced solid tumors (n = 26,715). As expected, HER2 gene expression was significantly higher in tumors with DNA amplification (&#62;=6 copies; median: 13.9 vs. 10.0 in log2 units; p &#60; 1e-100). Despite similar copy number levels in amplified breast vs. other cancers (median: 21.8 vs. 19.8 copies), HER2 expression levels were ~2-fold higher (median: 14.5 vs. 13.5; p = 1.3e-10). Similarly, HER2 expression levels were higher in non-amplified breast vs. other cancers (median: 10.7 vs. 9.9; p&#60;1e-100), suggesting that DNA amplification and cell lineage affect HER2 expression. Using our previously validated HER2 threshold, among 75 eligible SCMD breast cancer patients treated with 1st or 2nd line systemic trastuzumab or pertuzumab containing therapy, HER2 RNA High patients (n=46, 59%) had significantly longer time to next therapy (TTNT) compared to HER2 RNA Not High patients (median TTNT 26.9 vs. 5.6 months, adjusted hazard ratio 0.31, p=0.005 when adjusted for 1st vs. 2nd line, pertuzumab inclusion, and inclusion of chemotherapy or hormonal therapy).<br \/>In patients with available IHC data (n = 388), HER2 RNA expression trended with IHC across the 0-3+ range, however, while 3+ tumors had distinctly high RNA expression (median: 14.4), 0-2+ tumors had lower expression with overlapping distributions (median: 10.5, 10.9, 11.5, respectively), suggesting that 0-2+ tumors do not represent distinct biological groups, but rather a continuum of low expression. We defined a HER2 RNA Low threshold (&#62;10.6), corresponding to the top 75% of IHC 1-2+ breast cancers. Importantly, at this threshold, nearly half (44.1%) of 0+ breast cancers were also classified as HER2 RNA Low. Additionally, 25.8% of all non-breast solid tumors were classified as HER2 RNA Low. Given that HER2 RNA High predicted benefit from 1st generation anti-HER2 therapies, future studies should consider HER2 RNA Low as an alternative biomarker to Her2 IHC Low, with the opportunity to further expand trastuzumab deruxtecan use into the IHC 0+ breast cancer population and potentially to additional solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HER2,Biomarkers,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Personalized medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Laura  E.

The immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab targets the PD-1 signaling axis and has produced durable clinical response, but the efficacy is dependent on the anti-tumor activity of the immune system. We aimed to identify plasma proteins that could be used to identify patients who will respond to treatment with pembrolizumab.<br \/>Methods: Plasma samples were collected from 42 patients with advanced NSCLC before start of treatment with pembrolizumab and after 1 and 2 cycles of treatment. The plasma samples were analyzed using the Olink Proximity Extension Assay with an immuno-oncology panel detecting the expression level of 92 circulating plasma proteins. To evaluate the association between plasma protein expression and progression-free survival (PFS) the patients were stratified into two subgroups based on the median PFS (median=220 days).<br \/>Results: The patient subgroup with long PFS had significantly higher levels of Fas Ligand (FasL) and Inducible T Cell Costimulator Ligand (ICOSLG) before the start of treatment than patients with short PFS (p=0.0021 and p=0.0230 for FasL and ICOSLG). FasL remained significantly higher for patients with long PFS after 1 and 2 cycles of treatment (p=0.0170 and p=0.0190, respectively). Kaplan-Meier analysis of baseline ICOSLG and FasL expression showed longer PFS and overall survival (OS) for patients with high ICOSLG expression (p=0.0489 and p=0.0223 for PFS and OS) and for patients with high FasL expression (p=0.0064 and p=0.0069 for PFS and OS). An association was found between ICOSLG and FasL expression at baseline (R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.1403, p=0.0145), however the two proteins showed different dynamics during treatment, with FasL expression increasing during the early weeks of treatment, while little to no change is observed in ICOSLG expression. Combining the baseline expression of the two proteins identified a patient group with either a high expression of FasL or ICOSLG, or both, that had superior PFS (p=0.044) and OS (p=0.0017).<br \/>Conclusion: These findings suggest that the expression of FasL and ICOSLG at baseline may help identify patients who will respond to treatment with pembrolizumab.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Biomarkers,Immunotherapy,Predictive biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Simone Stensgaard<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Astrid Thomsen<sup>1<\/sup>, Julie  G.

Expression of the enzyme is highly cell cycle dependent and correlates with cell growth state. TK activity (TKa) is present in all proliferating cells but release into blood circulation is low or absent from quiescent cells. Numerous studies have shown TKa to be elevated in solid tumors as well as in the blood of cancer patients with active disease. DiviTum<sup>&#174;<\/sup> TKa, a clinically and analytically validated FDA cleared assay, can measure and quantify TKa in serum or plasma isolated from human and animal blood samples. TKa as a biomarker offers valuable information at all stages of drug development; from drug efficacy and dose response studies in cell culture and tumor xenograft models, to patient selection and treatment monitoring in clinical trials. Using TKa to measure the impact on cell proliferation as a drug evaluation endpoint can confirm mechanism of action efficacy and the minimally effective dose of a new compound rather than a maximally tolerated dose. In both cultured cells and mouse xenografts, a complete shutdown of tumor cell proliferation (assessed by TKa) can be observed well before and at much lower doses than when cell death or toxicity is used as the dose determination endpoint.<br \/>The TKa-biomarker can also be used as a pharmacodynamic tool in clinical trials to improve study endpoints. Patient baseline levels (BL) of TKa are predictive\/prognostic and can be used to identify which patients will respond to the therapy being tested vs those who will not. In metastatic breast cancer, a BL TKa value of &#60;250 DuA is significantly correlated with longer PFS (HR=1.76, p&#60;0.0001) and OS (HR=2.38, p&#60;0.0001) independent of patient and disease characteristics. On-therapy TKa levels and dynamics can be used in clinical trials to evaluate response to a drug as early as two weeks into the first cycle. In patients receiving CDK4\/6 inhibitors, TKa levels &#62;140 DuA at cycle 1 day 15 predicts for lack of benefit to the drug (HR=5.65, p&#60;0.0001).<br \/>TKa can also be used as a predictive biomarker for drugs that cause an immune reaction and increase in cell proliferation such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). When effective, ICIs cause an increase in immune cell proliferation which can be detected by elevated levels of TKa. Patients who do not achieve &#62;1.5 fold change in TKa levels as compared to BL, have a significantly shorter duration of response to an ICI (HR=3.70, p=0.002) and patients with high TKa during ICI treatment have significantly longer OS (HR=3.49, p&#60;0.05).<br \/>In summary, TKa is a translational liquid biomarker that can bridge between preclinical and clinical studies, providing fundamental information for decision making during early and late stage drug development. Data and examples of the utility of TKa as a companion diagnostic for drug development will be presented.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Thymidine kinase,Efficacy,Proliferation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mattias  K.

It is a negative checkpoint inhibitor that inhibits anti-tumor T cell response. In patients, VISTA is associated with poor overall survival in multiple tumor indications and is also a potential mediator of resistance to anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD1 therapies. Therefore, VISTA is a unique target for cancer immunotherapy.<br \/>Kineta has developed a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting VISTA, KVA12123, that is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1\/2 clinical trial in cancer patients with advanced solid tumors. This trial also includes a combination arm with pembrolizumab. In order to inform which patients may be susceptible to respond to our anti-VISTA antibody, we hypothesized that the best responders should be associated with a high expression of the target in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Therefore, after assay validation of VISTA labelling by immuno-histochemistry, we analyzed a large set of tumor samples and showed that VISTA was highly expressed on tumor infiltrating immune cells. This was particularly true for patients with non-small cell lung cancers, colorectal cancers, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, melanomas and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, and cervical cancers as well as ovarian cancers. VISTA expression was detected mostly on CD163 positive macrophages infiltrating the tumor. These macrophages potentially promote immunosuppression present in the TME and contribute to treatment failure with current immune checkpoint inhibitors like anti-PD1\/PD-L1 and CTLA-4. While previous studies reported VISTA expression on cancer cells, we were not able to confirm these results. In all tumor tissues tested, only infiltrating immune cells were labelled for VISTA.<br \/>We have investigated in parallel the expression level of soluble VISTA in the serum collected from cancer patients independent of this clinical trial. Sera were screened for patients with multiple tumor types. Patients of diverse sex and age were compared to healthy donors. After validation of the ELISA assay, we showed that sera derived from cancer patients exhibit high levels of soluble VISTA, and these levels tend to correlate with age. More data are needed to confirm that high levels of soluble VISTA are associated with advanced disease.<br \/>In the ongoing Phase 1\/2 clinical trial, tumor tissues and serum samples will be collected from cancer patients prior to treatment with KVA12123 to inform the possible significance of these biomarkers. This work could help to better understand the response to KVA12123 in relation to the expression level of VISTA in cancer tissues as well as in the blood.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Biomarkers,Immunohistochemistry,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Neda Kabi<sup><\/sup>, Chen Katz<sup><\/sup>, Remington Lance<sup><\/sup>, Jessica Cross<sup><\/sup>, Nathan Eyde<sup><\/sup>, Emily Frazier<sup><\/sup>, Kurt Lustig<sup><\/sup>, Yulia Ovechkina<sup><\/sup>, David Peckham<sup><\/sup>, Shaarwari Sridhar<sup><\/sup>, Carla Talbaux<sup><\/sup>, Isabelle Tihista<sup><\/sup>, Mei Xu<sup><\/sup>, Shawn Iadonato<sup><\/sup>, <b>Thierry Guillaudeux<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Kineta, Seattle, WA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ecec3546-d3d9-4850-81a0-8f77242203d8","ControlNumber":"7327","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;N.

As resistance to the first-line therapy evolves, there is potential for the tumor to develop sensitivities to other chemotherapeutic agents besides the active treatment. This concept is known as collateral sensitivity, and it presents an opportunity for medical providers to plan more effective treatment regimens. However, it can be difficult to predict due to the stochastic nature of evolution. By analyzing gene expression patterns among independent populations of an EWS cell line that have repeatedly evolved collateral responses, we aim to extract a collection of gene signatures, or sets of genes, that will predict states of collateral sensitivity against various existing chemotherapies.<br \/>To accomplish this, we will treat independently evolving replicates of an EWS cell line (A673) with the standard-of-care therapy to evolve resistance. Throughout this treatment regimen, we will regularly screen for collateral sensitivity against 100 FDA-approved cancer drugs and perform bulk RNA-sequencing. When collateral sensitivity against a drug is observed, we will utilize the RNA-sequencing data to extract gene signatures using differential expression analysis. The signatures will then be validated using patient-derived xenografts collected in our lab as well as from collaborators.<br \/>When completed, the sizable archive of sensitivity signatures we expect to assemble could greatly streamline the process of treatment planning for EWS patients, especially those with advanced disease. When a patient's response to primary therapy begins to decline, RNA- sequencing can be performed on a tumor biopsy, gene expression patterns can be compared with the validated signature library, and the most appropriate drug for the individual patient can be determined and used for subsequent treatment. Using this method, a patient's sensitivity profile can be reassessed at any point. This proposed method of treatment planning mitigates the need for excessive treatment regimens that are not guaranteed to be effective for every patient, thereby expanding the reach of precision medicine and potentially improving outcomes for EWS patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene expression,Predictive biomarkers,Ewing sarcoma,Evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kristi Lin-Rahardja<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jessica Scarborough<sup><\/sup>, Masahiro Hitomi<sup><\/sup>, Jacob  G.

Its existing gold standard test, immunohistochemistry (IHC) may insufficiently stratify patients, whereas adoption of Tyramide Signal Amplification-based multispectral mIF (ms-mIF) into clinical practice has been slow. We have established ms-mIF using clinical autostainers in the Anatomical Pathology Lab of Singapore General Hospital for almost a decade. A ms-mIF-based LDT assay was employed to simultaneously detect and quantify PD-L1 labelling with multiple antibody clones, for accurate assessment of tumor and immune cells. The test has since been embraced by private diagnostic companies and hospitals in the region.While ms-mIF can be a better patient screening method, its high requisite expertise, requirement of proprietary reagents from multiple suppliers and expensive specialized equipment have made its adoption challenging. Taking advantage of the repertoire of optimized IHC antibodies in the clinical lab, we conjugated these commercial primary antibodies using commercial fluorescent labelling kits to develop a proof-of-concept one-stop mIF solution to simultaneously detect multiple biomarkers. Owing to the common practice of LDT in Southeast Asia, we also generated in-house monoclonal antibodies, such as PD-L1 and CD39 to formulate customizable mIF assay. The staining was visualized using Zeiss Axioscan 7, validated using IHC and assessed in a cohort of immunotherapy-treated samples.Direct staining in mIF enables simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers on a single tissue section in one labelling step and faster turnover time. It also provides flexibility in the choice of antibody host species and dye usable, making mIF a fully customizable assay. This one-stop assay could potentially be packaged into a ready-to-use kit to include antibodies, reagents and protocols easily implementable in clinical labs. It overcomes technical barriers of ms-mIF as it requires less prerequisite expertise and increases accessibility of clinical labs to the assay for precision medicine.In summary, to our knowledge this is the first report on direct conjugation for multiplex biomarker detection for clinical application. It provides insight and vision for clinical labs to implement mIF as LDT and to develop their own LDT assay. Our future work includes development of 2-step mIF using fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies to improve detection signal.[J.L. and N.Y. contributed equally to this work.]","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiplex automation,Predictive biomarkers,Immunohistochemistry,Assay development,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jeffrey Chun Tatt Lim<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nur Zahirah M Yusoff<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhen Wei Neo<sup>1<\/sup>, Jia Meng<sup>1<\/sup>, Chwee Ming Lim<sup>2<\/sup>, Yee Joo Tan<sup>1<\/sup>, Joe Poh Sheng Yeong<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>A*STAR - Inst of Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB), Singapore, Singapore,<sup>2<\/sup>Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e4961594-0ccd-44d0-9cea-e7fc4e86fb42","ControlNumber":"7577","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

However, a limited number of biomarkers are available to guide clinicians in selecting the most effective therapy for all patients.<br \/>Methods: The clinical characteristics of 642 NSCLC patients and tumor sequencing data were collected retrospectively at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist. Cox-proportional hazard regression models were fit to identify mutations that were &#8220;beneficial&#8221; (hazard ratio &#60; 1) or &#8220;detrimental&#8221; (hazard ratio &#62; 1) for patients on different treatment regimens, followed by the generation of mutation composite scores (MCS) for each treatment. The overall survival (OS) of patients receiving each treatment was plotted based on the patients&#8217; MCS, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves tested the predictive power of each MCS for each treatment group. We also identified novel co-occurring and mutually exclusive mutations in each treatment group by mutation interaction analysis.<br \/>Results: We identified treatment-specific mutations associated with either a better or worse OS. The MCS generated for each treatment group significantly enhanced the prediction power compared to a single mutation with limited application in patients with rare mutations. Mutation signatures to chemotherapy (<i>NTRK1, FBXW7, BRAF, MPL, KRAS, and GATA3<\/i>) and immunotherapy (<i>MAP2K1, EGFR, CDK4, NTRK1<\/i>, and <i>NOTCH1<\/i>) have a comparable prediction power with actual clinical response.<br \/>Conclusions: NSCLC patients&#8217; responses to specific treatments are diverse because of tumor heterogeneity.

But how PSMA becomes overexpressed upon PC development, its modulation by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and its absence in neuroendocrine-differentiated PC is not well understood. The exact mechanism by which PSMA is regulated has not been defined. Understanding PSMA regulation in PC patients for diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment purposes would be extremely valuable and could be exploited for PSMA-targeted therapies. To address this, we sought to characterize the epigenetic landscape of FOLH1 (the gene for PSMA) and determine the regulatory factors involved in FOLH1 transcription. Based on histone marker and protein ChIP-Seq data sets alongside ATAC-seq, we found that FOLH1 is a Super Enhancer (SE) and is collectively bound by an array of transcription factors (TFs), including AR, FOXA1, and HOXB13. We developed a hidden Markov model (HMM) with seven chromatin states built on average TF binding in the FOLH1 landscape and trained on the FOLH1 gene and known enhancer regions. Chromatin states were annotated based on features in the FOLH1 gene. With a simple regression model and k-fold cross-validation, mean occupancy of the three TFs and H3K27Ac in each state accurately predicts FOLH1 expression (&#961; &#62; 0.9) across PC samples. To assess the functionality of the enhancer regions predicted by our computational HMM, we performed a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen with a nuclease dead-Cas9 protein conjugated to the KRAB transcriptional repressor and directed by a pool of gRNAs that tile across the AR protein-bound regions within the FOLH1 landscape. A sliding window analysis of our CRISPRi screen revealed that the top scoring gRNAs delineate 5 Regulatory Regions (RRs) found within the SE region of FOLH1 that control FOLH1\/PSMA expression. Motif identification in these RRs have provided a list of potential TF candidates involved in regulating FOLH1, and knockdown experiments are currently being conducted to evaluate individual and combinations of TF contribution to FOLH1 expression. There is evidence for a constellation of TFs responsible for regulating FOLH1, and context-specific modifications in FOLH1 regulation will need to be evaluated in various models and conditions. These results suggest FOLH1 is regulated by epigenetic control in the SE region and may be altered in progression or with ADT. Characterizing the regulation of FOLH1\/PSMA will result in a deeper understanding of the meaning of alterations in uptake on PSMA imaging and may enable some degree of control over expression, thus aiding in PSMA-directed treatments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PSMA,Prostate cancer,Super Enhancer,FOLH1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Margaret  E.

However, the efficacy of ACT is offset by the development of complication such as peripheral neuropathy, which leads to compromised quality of life, while ACT is expected to prevent tumor recurrence in only 5% and 20% in Stage2 and 3 patients, respectively. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a biomarker that accurately predicts the effect of ACT and therefore helps guide ACT eligibility.<br \/><u>Methods:<\/u> <u><\/u>We enrolled a total of 3,023 cases with CRC, for whom targeted-capture sequencing was performed that covered 169 known or putative driver genes and 1,660 polymorphoic sites to detect somatic mutations and copy number alterations (CNAs), respectively. RNA sequencing was also performed to detect driver gene fusions and to profile gene expression. We identified, through univariate analysis, gene mutations\/CNAs as well as clinical parameters using those cases who did not received ACT to establish a model that predict time to recurrence (TTR) using the Cox proportional hazard modelling. Thereafter, the model was applied to those who did receive ACT to assess the impact of the model in the prediction of TTR.<br \/><u>Results<\/u>: <u><\/u>We identified a total of 32145 mutations and\/or 44511 CNAs in 2970 (98%) out of 3,023 cases. Mutations were found in 55 driver genes, including 15 previously unknown drivers, such as <i>MAP2K1<\/i>, <i>AKT1<\/i>, and <i>TCF7<\/i>. According to the number of mutations, 278 casese were classified as hypermutated cases. The remaining &#8216;non-hypermutated cases&#8217; (n=2692) were classified into APC-mutated, <i>RNF43\/ZNRF3<\/i>-mutated, <i>CTNNB1<\/i>-mutated, <i>RSPO<\/i>-fusion(+) and other Wnt-mutation(&#8722;) cases. The TTR prediction model was constructed by repeating Cox regression 1000 times using randomly selected 80% of the non-hypermutated cases and variables identified in univariate analysis. Adopting those variables selected in &#38;gt;70% models, we established the final model including both genetic (mutations\/CNAs) and clinical variables, based on which we classified patients into 4 risk groups, low\/intermediate\/high\/very-high. Finally, by applying the classification to those who received ACT, we demonstrated that 18% of Stage2 and the majority of Stage3 cases with high\/very-high risks were predicted to benefit from ACT, whereas most of the Stage2 and as many as 19% of Stage3 cases received ACT with no significant improvement of TTR. Approximately 5% of Stage1 cases belonged to the high-risk category and potentially benefit from ACT.<br \/><u>Conclusions:<\/u> <u><\/u>On the basis of large-scale genotyping of clinically well-annotated CRC cases, we proposed molecular classification of CRC and established a model that enabled prediction of TTR and risk stratification, which was successfully used to identify cases who benefited (within Stage 2\/3 cases) or will benefit (in Stage1 cases) from ACT to prolong TTR.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yoshikage Inoue<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nobuyuki Kakiuchi<sup>2<\/sup>, Kenichi Yoshida<sup>3<\/sup>, Yasuhito Nanya<sup>4<\/sup>, Yasuhide Takeuchi<sup>5<\/sup>, Yuichi Shiraishi<sup>6<\/sup>, Kenichi Chiba<sup>6<\/sup>, Tetusichi Yoshizato<sup>7<\/sup>, Hiroko Tanaka<sup>8<\/sup>, Satoshi Nagayama<sup>9<\/sup>, Kazutaka Obama<sup>10<\/sup>, Satoru Miyano<sup>8<\/sup>, Seishi Ogawa<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>The Hakubi Center for Advanced Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Center for Cancer Development and Progression, National Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Hematology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Clinical Bio-resource Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>6<\/sup>Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics, National Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>7<\/sup>8.\u0009Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Karolinska, Sweden,<sup>8<\/sup>Department of Integrated Analytics M&D Data Science Center, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>9<\/sup>Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Uji Tokusyukai Medical Center, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>10<\/sup>Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a4f182ae-e2d1-4995-a71a-c9b56da456c1","ControlNumber":"7286","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Identifying molecular subtype may inform treatment approaches, but current subtyping schemas rely on tumor biopsies which are invasive and can be technically challenging. Blood based epigenetic assays are commercially available, and identification of subtype-associated epigenetic modifications may provide a path toward blood-based PDAC molecular subtyping. We analyzed methylation levels and developed a subtype classifier using methylation data on PDAC tumors. Using this classifier, we then developed a methylation-specific qPCR assay to subtype PDAC tumors by analyzing methylation at particular sites in tumor DNA which may now be further adapted to more facile liquid biopsy approaches.<br \/>Methods: Using methylation data (n=150) from TCGA PAAD, we applied a random forest (RF) model followed by a k-Top Scoring Pairs (k-TSP) algorithm to develop a methylation site-based classifier that allows prediction of subtype by comparing methylation levels between paired sites. The classifier was validated on two independent datasets, including ICGC (n=82) and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) (n=21). We designed methylation-specific qPCR primers for these sites and validated their specificity with fully methylated or fully unmethylated DNA. Using genomic DNA extracted from 10 PDAC PDXs of known molecular subtype, we obtained methylation levels at sites identified by the classifier via a SYBR Green-based qPCR assay. We then used our classifier to predict subtype of the PDX tumors.<br \/>Results: We validated our RF-kTSP methylation subtype classifier on two independent cohorts and predicted subtype using 20 methylation sites. In ICGC, we found balanced accuracy=0.94, AUROC=0.98, AU-PR=0.89. In PDX PDAC tumors, we found balanced accuracy=1, AUROC=1, AU-PR=1. We designed 14\/20 primers for qPCR and confirmed specificity for methylated DNA. Using 14\/20 methylation sites, we achieved 80% correct subtype prediction of 10 PDX tumors (5\/5 basal-like, 3\/5 classical).<br \/>Conclusion: We have developed a methylation-based classifier that accurately and replicably predicts PDAC subtype. We continue to develop a qPCR assay for PDAC subtype that so far has 80% accuracy using 14\/20 probes. We are completing validation of the remaining 6 primers and correlating methylation levels at each site with those obtained from EPIC array methylation analysis. The long-term goal is to apply our complete set of primers in a digital droplet PCR assay that will be amenable for subtyping using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Methylation,Machine learning,Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zachary Schrank<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Des Weighill<sup>2<\/sup>, Hannah Thel<sup>1<\/sup>, Hannah Trembath<sup>1<\/sup>, Ashley Morrison<sup>2<\/sup>, Jen Jen Yeh<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>UNC School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC,<sup>2<\/sup>Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c9fa4e94-9892-491c-9a30-eac3d8aef607","ControlNumber":"6898","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Z.
