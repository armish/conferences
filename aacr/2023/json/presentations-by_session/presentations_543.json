There is growing evidence that immunotherapy outcomes are influenced by the gut microbiome. This includes differential associations for key bacterial groups such as <i>Bacteroidaceae<\/i> and <i>Ruminococacceae<\/i>. However, how gut microbes interact with the immune system to influence the success of ICIs and\/or the development of irAEs remains unclear.<i><\/i><br \/>Methods: We longitudinally profiled the gut microbiome and circulating immune cell subsets in stage III melanoma patients from Australia and the Netherlands (n=126) treated on trial with combination anti-PD-1\/anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy in the neo-adjuvant setting (NCT02977052). Paired pre- and post-treatment (baseline\/week 6) stool samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing (n=126) and matched PBMCs were comprehensively profiled using mass cytometry (n=71).<br \/>Results: Treatment with anti-PD-1\/anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy was associated with an increase in the frequency (% total CD45+) of CD8+ effector memory T cells (Tem) (CD45RA- CCR7-) (P= 0.0096) and a reduction in regulatory T cells (Tregs) (CD25+FoxP3+) (P= 0.0029) between baseline and week 6. The reduction in Tregs was dominantly observed in responders (P= 0.0016) compared to non-responders (P= 0.9515). However, patients who developed severe irAEs were also particularly deficient in Tregs at week 6 compared to patients with no or mild toxicities (P= 0.0293). Notably, in patients where circulating Tregs were reduced, the degree of reduction in Tregs positively correlated with the baseline relative abundance of <i>Bacteroides<\/i> (P&#60; 0.0001). Higher pre-treatment <i>Bacteroides<\/i> abundance was also linked to the development of more severe irAEs (P= 0.0472) and overall steroid use (P= 0.0345) prior to week 6. Thus, while <i>Bacteriodes<\/i> here is linked to a response-associated parameter (reduction in Tregs), it is also linked to severe, early irAEs. In contrast, a higher abundance of <i>Ruminococcaceae<\/i> was protective, and overall a greater proportion of patients with <i>Ruminococcaceae <\/i>dominated microbiomes were responders, highlighting a role for both bacterial groups in shaping ICI outcomes.<br \/>Conclusions: While response to ICI therapy was associated with a decrease in circulating Tregs, excessive reduction in Tregs was observed in patients that develop severe irAEs. Together, this highlights the delicate balance between immune activation and regulation in facilitating anti-tumor immune responses whilst avoiding irAEs. Our data suggests that the gut microbiome may have a role in establishing immune tone prior to and during immunotherapy and may influence this &#8220;tipping point&#8221; and the risk of developing irAEs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-06 Microbiome, inflammation, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Immunotherapy,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Rebecca  C.

In mice, T<sub>RM <\/sub>cells<sub> <\/sub>are defined by their expression of tissue retention markers such as CD69 and CD103, and lack of egress markers such as CD62L, CCR7 and S1PR1. We previously showed that depletion of regulatory T cells induces the generation of protective CD8 Trm cells in skin and draining LNs of B16 melanoma tumor-excised mice. While tumor specific Trm cells were shown to stably reside in tissues at steady state, little is known about their migration between tissue compartments and circulation during primary and recall responses to melanoma. Using gp100-specific transgenic pmel CD8 T cells expressing a Kaede-GFP photoconvertible marker, we investigated the trafficking patterns of tumor Ag specific CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells that were labeled in situ by exposure to UV light in the skin. During primary tumor growth, we observed pronounced movement of antigen-experienced pmel cells through skin to tumor-draining LNs. This trafficking behavior could be inhibited by treatment with FTY720, indicating its S1PR-dependence. Such movement was no longer evident at memory timepoints. However, re-challenge with B16 cells in the dermis induced rapid pmel T cell egress to both LNs and circulation. Recallenge-mediated Trm cell skin egress was confirmed using anti-Thy1.1 monoclonal antibody to deplete circulating and lymphoid memory, while preserving skin T<sub>RM. <\/sub>Here we found that skin T<sub>RM<\/sub> proliferate and transiently increase expression of Tbet, but go on to generate a durable secondary Trm response in lymph nodes. These data highlight T cell movement between tissues during Trm programming and recall responses to cancer, and shed light on a potential mechanism for the generation T<sub>RM<\/sub> populations in tumor-draining lymph nodes. Moreover, our results highlight the potential for retrograde movement of Trm responses from peripheral tissue reservoirs to participate more broadly in systemic anti-tumor immunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-01 Adaptive immunity in tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,T cell,Immuno-oncology,Migration,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Cameron Messier<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Nikhil Khatwani<sup><\/sup>, Aaron Hawkes<sup><\/sup>, Yuyang (Poppy) Huang<sup><\/sup>, Mary Jo Turk<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, Hanover, NH","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f2bef226-1532-4a29-a07e-949a6a53def0","ControlNumber":"8169","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

Recent studies from our group and others demonstrated that upfront use of targeted therapy leads to decreased immune infiltrate and confers resistance to immunotherapy. We have previously showed that HDAC8 reprograming cell transcriptional states leads to reduced recognition by immune system. However, it&#8217;s unclear how HDAC8 activity modulates the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). In this study, we used integrated single cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and a novel BRAF-V600E; PTEN+\/- melanoma genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) to explore &#8220;cold&#8221; TIME modulated by HDAC8. Analysis of human melanoma cells overexpressing HDAC8 by ATAC-seq, ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq showed that HDAC8 expression significantly increases chromatin accessibility, H3K27 promoter region acetylation and gene expression of IL-11. Increased IL-11 protein expression was confirmed by cytokine array in isogenic SM1 mouse melanoma cells expressing HDAC8.Overexpression of HDAC8 in the GEMM accelerated melanoma development and was associated with worse overall survival rate. Analysis of HDAC8 and control tumors by scRNA-seq and immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that HDAC8 overexpressing tumors dramatically decreased CD4 and CD8 T cell infiltration and increased MDSCs and IL-11 expression. We next explored whether IL-11 drives the expansion and polarization of MDSCs and subsequent reduction in T cell infiltration and activation. A MDSCs polarization assay demonstrated that addition of IL-11 led to increased expansion and polarization of MDSCs from mouse bone marrow myeloid cells. A MDSCs suppression assay confirmed IL-11 induced MDSCs accumulation significantly reduced T cell proliferation and activation. We show for the first time that HDAC8 expression regulates immune escape by activating IL-11 expression and driving MDSCs expansion. Going forward, inhibition of HDAC8 activity is intriguing as a novel therapeutic strategy to reverse tumor derived immune suppression and to ultimately improve patient responses to immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Epigenetic regulation of tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,HDAC8,MDSCs,IL-11,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chao Zhang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Emmons<sup>1<\/sup>, Richard Bennett<sup>2<\/sup>, Jonathan Licht<sup>2<\/sup>, Keiran Smalley<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Florida Health Sciences Center, Gainesville, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1b6b157f-e593-471a-9b36-49bca41ef23b","ControlNumber":"4484","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

In recent years, tumor-specific neoantigen vaccines have shown significant promise&#8212;promoting tumor regression and increasing survival benefit in certain malignancies by therapeutically directing the immune system to target previously protected tumor specific antigens. However, despite encouraging preclinical data, objective and durable responses have remained elusive&#8212;highlighting a requirement for improved therapeutic platforms that permit delivery and targeting of diverse sets of tumor antigens to enhance the efficacy of cancer vaccines. Through synthetic biology, we have engineered living microbial vectors harboring constructs encoding synthetic arrays of tumor-specific neoantigens that specifically colonize tumors following intravenous injection and deliver high levels of neoantigen cargo&#8212;both extracellularly (within the tumor microenvironment) and intracellularly (to the cytosol of tumor-resident phagocytes). These engineered vectors robustly activate innate immune cascades and effectively prime tumor neoantigen-directed T cell responses to promote tumor regression and survival in advanced murine solid tumor and lung metastasis models. Extensive remodeling of the tumor immune microenvironment accompanies therapeutic efficacy, with increased activation of tumor neoantigen-specific CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, broadened stimulation of tumor-infiltrating B and T cells, and reduced numbers of intratumoral myeloid cells exhibiting immunosuppressive phenotypes. This work provides a foundational platform for the development of a new class of next&#8209;generation tumor vaccines, leveraging the advantages of living medicines to deliver diverse arrays of tumor&#8209;specific neoantigens within the optimal immunostimulatory context to induce potent anti-tumor immunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bacterial therapy,Immunotherapy,Neoantigens,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Andrew A.

Clinical data shows that increasing antigen presentation diversity, genomic instability, tumor mutational burden and HLA diversity, as well as preventing permanent exhaustion of pre-existing cytotoxic T cells, caused by chronic cancer antigen stimulation, are all factors that improve clinical response to ICI. Additionally, increasing presentation of cancer-specific target peptides on cancer cells will enhance T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated therapeutics such as ImmTACs or TCR-Engineered T cells. Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) trims peptides loaded into classical and non-classical MHC Class I. In cancer, knockout or inhibition of ERAP1 changes a proportion of the antigen repertoire, generating and upregulating cancer antigens. This leads to the activation of <i>de novo<\/i> anti-tumor T cell responses, causing tumor growth inhibition and bypassing T cell exhaustion. We report the preclinical development, characterization and mechanistic analysis of the first-in-class ERAP1 inhibitor, GRWD5769. Extensive analysis of the immunopeptidomes of diverse cancer cell lines robustly showed that GRWD5769 modulates the cancer-related antigen repertoire across genotypes and cancer-type backgrounds. Novel or upregulated neoantigens generated by ERAP1 inhibition are conserved across cancer cell types and genetic backgrounds. ERAP1 inhibition in combination with an ICI (anti-PD1 mAb) diversified the TCR repertoire, upregulated prognostic immune gene markers in the tumor, including markers for recently activated (thus non-exhausted) T cells, and drove infiltration of T cells into syngeneic mouse model tumors. This combination is efficacious across syngeneic models, including different mouse strains and the effects of ERAP1 inhibition on the T cell response correlate with efficacy. Further, <i>ex vivo<\/i> human T cell co-cultures with cancer cell lines demonstrate that novel and upregulated neoantigens generated by ERAP1 inhibition drive tumor cell killing. In addition, these studies showed enhanced tumor cell killing when an ImmTAC was used in combination with ERAP1 inhibition to enhance presentation of the cancer-specific target peptide. In conclusion, the first-in-class, ERAP1 inhibitor clinical candidate, GRWD5769, drives novel anti-tumor T cell responses through neoantigen creation and circumventing T cell exhaustion. GRWD5769 has demonstrated a good safety profile in GLP toxicology studies and robust proof of mechanism and proof of principle biomarkers have been developed to provide a clear path to establish the activity and efficacy of GRWD5769 in patients in 2023.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antigen presentation,HLA class I,Immune checkpoint blockade,T cell engager,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Andrew Leishman<sup>1<\/sup>, Wayne Paes<sup>2<\/sup>, Emma Sparrow<sup>3<\/sup>, Ana Ribeiro<sup>3<\/sup>, Michael Cundell<sup>3<\/sup>, Milos Aleksic<sup>3<\/sup>, Michael  P.

However, the complete set of molecular drivers connecting this histologic observation to enhanced tumor clearance remain enigmatic.<br \/>In updated analysis of the Stand Up 2 Cancer-Mark Foundation (SU2C-MARK) Cohort - a collection of 393 patients with whole exome and\/or RNA sequencing along with matched checkpoint blockade response annotation - we identify a prominent predictive role for inducible components of the immunoproteasome, a non-canonical peptide processing complex upstream of antigen presentation. Notably, these subunits are enriched as predictors relative to interferon-inducible genes as well as proteasome components in general, and are consistently associated with objective response, progression-free survival and overall survival. Expression of Immunoproteasome subunits associates positively with TCR (but not BCR) burden, supporting a mechanistic model in which enhanced immunoproteasome processivity leads to superior T-cell recognition. Furthermore, although they are known to be targets of interferon gamma (IFN&#611;), we demonstrate that their expression is better modeled via a combination of IFN&#611; and tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF&#945;) levels, suggesting they may act as integrators of multiple cytokine cascades.<br \/>Given the fact that the immunoproteasome can alter both antigen quantity as well as quality (including peptide cleavage site preference), the enhanced expression of this complex in the setting of checkpoint blockade response may have important implications for modeling of antigen presentation. These data also suggest novel strategies to enhance immune checkpoint blockade.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Antigen presentation,Lung cancer: non-small cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Vivek Naranbhai<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Arvind Ravi<sup>2<\/sup>, Matthew Hellmann<sup>3<\/sup>, Monica Arniella<sup>4<\/sup>, Mark Holton<sup>4<\/sup>, Samuel Freeman<sup>4<\/sup>, Chip Stewart<sup>4<\/sup>, Ignaty Leshchiner<sup>4<\/sup>, Jaegil Kim<sup>5<\/sup>, Yo Akiyama<sup>4<\/sup>, Aaron Griffin<sup>6<\/sup>, Natalie Vokes<sup>7<\/sup>, Mustafa Sakhi<sup>1<\/sup>, Vashine Kamesan<sup>1<\/sup>, Hira Rizvi<sup>3<\/sup>, Biagio Ricciuti<sup>8<\/sup>, Patrick Forde<sup>9<\/sup>, Valsamo Anagnostou<sup>9<\/sup>, Jonathan Riess<sup>10<\/sup>, Don Gibbons<sup>7<\/sup>, Nathan Pennell<sup>11<\/sup>, Vamsidhar Velcheti<sup>12<\/sup>, Subba Digumarthy<sup>1<\/sup>, Mari Mino-Kenudson<sup>1<\/sup>, Andrea Califano<sup>6<\/sup>, John Heymach<sup>7<\/sup>, Roy Herbst<sup>13<\/sup>, Julie Brahmer<sup>9<\/sup>, Kurt Schalper<sup>13<\/sup>, Victor Velculescu<sup>9<\/sup>, Brian Henick<sup>6<\/sup>, Naiyer Rizvi<sup>14<\/sup>, Pasi Janne<sup>8<\/sup>, Mark Awad<sup>2<\/sup>, Andrew Chow<sup>15<\/sup>, Benjamin Greenbaum<sup>15<\/sup>, Marta Luksza<sup>16<\/sup>, Alice Shaw<sup>1<\/sup>, Jedd Wolchok<sup>17<\/sup>, Nir Hacohen<sup>4<\/sup>, Gad Getz<sup>4<\/sup>, Justin Gainor<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>DFCI\/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA,<sup>3<\/sup>AstraZeneca, New York, NY,<sup>4<\/sup>Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA,<sup>5<\/sup>GlaxoSmithKline, Waltham, MA,<sup>6<\/sup>Columbia University, New York, NY,<sup>7<\/sup>MD Anderson, Houston, TX,<sup>8<\/sup>Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA,<sup>9<\/sup>Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD,<sup>10<\/sup>UC Davis, Sacramento, CA,<sup>11<\/sup>Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH,<sup>12<\/sup>NYU Langone Health, New York, NY,<sup>13<\/sup>Yale, New Haven, CT,<sup>14<\/sup>Synthekine Inc, Menlo Park, CA,<sup>15<\/sup>Memorial Sloan Kettering, New York, NY,<sup>16<\/sup>Mount Sinai, New York, NY,<sup>17<\/sup>Cornell Medicine, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bee2100b-6604-42f7-af18-6408c9b695f6","ControlNumber":"7875","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;V.

For most solid tumors, colonization of regional or distant lymph nodes (LNs) typically precedes the formation of distant organ metastases, yet it remains unclear whether LN metastasis plays a functional role in disease progression. LNs are major sites of anti-tumor lymphocyte education, including in the context of immunotherapy, yet LN metastasis frequently correlates with further disease progression. Here, we find that LN metastasis represents a critical step in tumor progression through the capacity of such metastases to induce tumor-specific immune tolerance in a manner that promotes further dissemination of tumors to distant organs. Using an <i>in vivo<\/i> passaging approach of a non-metastatic syngeneic melanoma, we generated 300 unique cell lines exhibiting varying degrees of LN metastatic capacity. We show that the presence of these LN metastases enables distant organ seeding of metastases in a manner that the parental tumor cannot, and this effect is eliminated in mice lacking an adaptive immune response. Furthermore, this promotion of distant seeding by LN metastases is tumor specific. Using flow cytometry and single-cell sequencing to perform comprehensive immune profiling, we identify multiple cellular mediators of tolerance. In particular, we find that LN metastases have the capacity to both resist NK cell cytotoxicity and induce regulatory T cells (Tregs). Furthermore, depletion of NK cells <i>in vivo<\/i> enables non-metastatic tumors to disseminate to LNs, and ablation of Tregs using FoxP3-DTR mice eliminates the occurrence of lymphatic metastases. Adoptive transfer of Tregs from the LNs of mice bearing LN metastasis to na&#239;ve mice facilitates metastasis in a manner that Tregs from mice without LN metastases cannot, and we find that these Tregs are induced in an antigen-specific manner. Whole exome sequencing revealed that neither the metastatic proclivity nor immunosuppression evolve through the acquisition of driver mutations, loss of neoantigens, loss of MHC class I presentation, or decreases in melanoma antigen expression. Rather, by RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, we show that a conserved interferon signaling axis is upregulated in LN metastases and is rendered stable through epigenetic reprogramming of chromatin accessibility resulting from chronic exposure to interferons <i>in vivo<\/i>. Furthermore, using CRISPR\/Cas9, we find that these pathways are required for LN metastatic seeding, and validate their conserved significance in additional mouse models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and humans with LN metastatic disease. Together, these findings demonstrate a critical role for LN metastasis in promoting tumor-specific immunosuppression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-10 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Extrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Immunosuppression,Regulatory T cells,Interferons,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nathan E.
