[{"Abstract":"<b>Background<\/b> Tumor complexity and heterogeneity require matching of actionable genomic alterations with available therapy to increase response rates and prolong survival in patients. However, it has been a long-standing challenge for treating oncologists to select an effective patient-specific therapeutic strategy due to the molecular rationale, disease relevance, and patient-specific issues. To provide a decision-support tool to aid oncologists and educate patients, we have developed a set of molecular and clinical evidence-based criteria as an algorithm for ranking therapeutic strategies in order to deliver optimal care and improve outcomes in patients with malignancy.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> History of present illness (HPI) and comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) results of 203 patients with malignant tumors were reviewed by our multidisciplinary Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) from June 2021 to August 2022, and therapeutic recommendations were provided with Matching Score based on molecular matching only as well as with Ranking Score calculated by our molecular and clinical evidence-based algorithm with the criteria not only focusing on molecular matching, but also including disease relevance, patient-specific clinical considerations and treatment availability as weighting factors (Cohort 2). The other 50 patients with previously treated solid tumors reviewed by MTB (before 2018) and treatment recommendations provided with Matching Score only, were used as a control group (Cohort 1). The matching rates from recommendations and treatment outcomes of the patients were then assessed.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> In Cohort 1, of the 50 patients, 33 patients (66%) received matched therapeutic plans recommended by our MTB. The other 17 patients were not on a matched plan from the MTB. Twelve patients (36.4% of 33 patients) achieved progression-free survival (PFS) at 12-week time point, including 8 patients (24.2%) achieved PFS at 6-month time point. The other 21 patients (63.6% of 33 patients) could not be assessed due to treatment termination per drug toxicity or death before the follow-up time point. The median PFS\/overall survival (OS) for patients with a Matching Score &#62; 50% (<i>N<\/i> = 17) were 7.5\/10.5 months, whereas with Matching Score &#8804; 50% (<i>N<\/i> = 16) were 3\/7.35 months. In Cohort2, of the 203 patients, 89 (43.8%) patients have initiated matched therapeutic plans and follow-up is ongoing. Updated results will be presented at the meeting.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b> Our novel molecular and clinical evidence-based algorithm may be used to support oncologists decision-making to utilize the most clinically appropriate and effective therapeutic options. Further validation studies and development of an user-friendly computational ranking platform based on the algorithm are planned in order.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-03 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Cancer genomics,Targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yuliang Sun<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Tobias Meissner<sup><\/sup>, Rachel Elsey<sup><\/sup>, Leah Theisen<sup><\/sup>, Crystal Hattum<sup><\/sup>, Bing Xu<sup><\/sup>, John Lee<sup><\/sup>, Casey Williams<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Avera Cancer Institute, Sioux Falls, SD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f3b91a57-7136-4ca2-af6b-09e2d9237424","ControlNumber":"5350","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Due to the limited treatment options and diversity of subtypes there is an unmet need to develop novel clinical approach to capture tumor heterogeneity and to guide personalized therapy in PLC.<br \/>Methods: 33 surgically resected PLC patient tissues were cultured for organoid models. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) and matched primary tumors were molecularly characterized by whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Subset of PDOs were screened for sensitivity to clinical medication recommended by National Comprehensive National network (NCCN) guideline to evaluate the feasibility of PLC-derived organoids in drug testing.<br \/>Results:11 HCC, 1 ICC and 2 neuroendocrine tumors from patients were successfully established for organoid models. The success rate for generation of PLC organoids was 42.4% (14\/33). To investigate whether organoids preserved the molecular characteristics of the originating tumors, 14 matched tumor-organoid pairs of genomic profile concordance and 3 pairs of gene expression profiles were analyzed based on WES and RNA-seq, respectively. Of the total somatic mutations found in the tumor tissues, a median of 55.5% (range 12.5% - 92.9%) mutations was observed in the corresponding PLC organoids. <i>TP53 <\/i>was the most common mutated gene either in tumors or in the organoids, with the same mutational frequency of 71.4% (10\/14). Gene expression of organoids were highly correlated with their matched parental tumor tissue (median Spearman's correlation coefficient r = 0.81, range 0.76 - 0.85). To investigate the utility of PLC organoids for drug screening, multiple anti-cancer compounds (n=6-9) in standard clinical care were tested in 5 organoids which were showed high genomic concordance with their originating tumors. A good consistency between the drug screening and validation results was observed on patient NO.43 with ICC. The organoid of NO.43 was most sensitive to combined chemotherapy of irinotecan plus cisplatin. Together with drug testing result and clinical practice guidelines, this ICC patient was treated with irinotecan plus cisplatin after surgery and demonstrated durable response in clinical. In one-year follow-up no sign of recurrence was observed.<br \/>Conclusion: PLC organoids intermediately to highly recapitulates the molecular and biological features of tumors. Drug sensitivity testing on PLC organoid models have the potential to guide personalized treatment in the clinical setting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-03 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,Organoids,Precision medicine,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jianhua Rao<sup>1<\/sup>, Feng Cheng<sup>1<\/sup>, Long Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaohu Sun<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Chao Song<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, Xuejiao Ma<sup>3<\/sup>, Lei Ye<sup>3<\/sup>, Wanglong Deng<sup>3<\/sup>, Yansong Li<sup>3<\/sup>, Zaozao Chen<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Hepatobiliary Center of The First Affiliated Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China,<sup>2<\/sup>State Key Laboratory of Translational Medicine and Innovative Drug Development, Jiangsu Simcere Diagnostics Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Nanjing Simcere Medical Laboratory Science Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China,<sup>4<\/sup>School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f689b50a-b949-4a53-8fc1-172bbdc6d1a1","ControlNumber":"3348","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

In hematological and solid cancers, oncogenic fusions may be prognostic, diagnostic, or therapeutic biomarkers. Improved detection and understanding of the functional implications of such fusions may be beneficial for patient care. Herein, we report gene fusions in different solid tumors seen in a community cancer center.<br \/>Method: We retrospectively analyzed our internal genomic cancer center-specific cBioPortal database for gene fusions identified by DNA and RNA sequencing of solid tumors through a CLIA\/CAP commercial lab from 2016-2022. We divided the identified fusions into two groups: 1) known oncogenic fusions; and 2) unclassified fusions.<br \/>Results: We identified 420 known oncogenic fusions in 4,415 tumors. Oncogenic fusions occurred most often in ovarian adenocarcinoma (N=62\/420; 14.8%), followed by non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (N=55\/420; 13.1%), prostate cancer (N=48\/420; 11.4%), breast cancer (N=46\/420; 10.1%), glioblastoma (N=35\/420; 8.3%), and colorectal cancer (N=22\/420; 5.2%). We identified <i>EML4-ALK<\/i> fusions in 13 tumor samples and <i>KIF5B-RET<\/i> fusions in 9 tumors, all in NSCLC. We identified 18 fusions in soft tissue sarcomas, including the fusions that are the hallmark of synovial sarcomas, such as <i>SS18-SSX1<\/i> and <i>SS18-SSX2<\/i>. In addition, we identified 25 unclassified fusions (Table).<br \/>Conclusions: 9.5% of our tumors have oncogenic fusions that may be clinically relevant, which suggests patients with advanced cancers should have comprehensive molecular profiling that includes RNA sequencing. Additional studies are needed to determine the function of the identified unclassified gene fusions to assess potential clinical significance.

However, genomic medicine has its limitations, and it is imperative to establish precision medicine based on a new concept to match the dynamic changes in cancer. Focusing on phosphorylation signaling in cancer cells, we have been developing deep phosphoproteome analysis from minute endoscopic biopsy specimens frozen within 20 seconds of collection. This is to enable phosphorylation signal profiling that reflects the phosphorylation signal state in the patient's body as much as possible.<br \/>Methods: We collected endoscopic biopsy specimens from 85 patients with gastric cancer. Post-treatment specimens from nine gastric cancer patients were obtained two months later after the initiation of drug therapy. In a single endoscopic procedure, three tumor specimens and three normal gastric mucosa specimens were collected concomitantly from each patient. Each specimen was separately put in a screw-cap tube and immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen within 20 s after collection. Frozen specimens were stored at -80 &#176;C until further sample preparation. Proteome and phosphoproteome analysis were performed by multiplex analysis using Tandem Mass Tag reagent. Genomic analysis was performed by using a targeted high-multiplex PCR-based NGS panel (OncoMine Comprehensive Assay).<br \/>Results: Using this system, we obtained phosphorylation profiles of 340 specimens from 85 untreated gastric cancer patients. Ultrasensitive mass spectrometry-based proteomics quantified an average of 21000 phosphorylation sites and divided gastric cancer patients into subtype 1 (CDK active, 35%), subtype 2 (EMT, 15%), and subtype 3. (Others, 50%). The association with the four subtypes defined by TCGA was low. Furthermore, EMT type increased to 67% after chemotherapy. These results strongly suggest that gastric cancer undergoes dynamic transformation with treatment. The kinase activity profile of each subtype is useful information to provide therapeutic options for each subtype. Furthermore, our method of quantifying phosphorylation signals in cancer using biopsy specimens is expected to be a powerful driver of signaling-based precision medicine, not only for determining subtypes, but also for selecting treatment options and measuring drug efficacy.<br \/>Conclusions: We succeeded in developing the ultra-sensitive phosphorylation analysis system, which can quantify phosphorylation at more than 20,000 sites from endoscopic biopsy specimens, and propose a molecular classification dividing gastric cancer into three subtypes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-03 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Phosphorylation,Proteomic analysis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jun Adachi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Masahiko Aoki<sup>2<\/sup>, Hidekazu Hirano<sup>3<\/sup>, Yuichi Abe<sup>4<\/sup>, Ryohei Narumi<sup>1<\/sup>, Kazufumi Honda<sup>5<\/sup>, Takeshi Tomonaga<sup>1<\/sup>, Kenji Mizuguchi<sup>1<\/sup>, Takaki Yoshikawa<sup>6<\/sup>, Narikazu Boku<sup>7<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Laboratory of Proteomics for Drug Discovery, (NIBIOHN) The National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health, and Nutrition, Ibaraki, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology Division, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>4<\/sup>Division of Molecular Diagnostics, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Bioregulation, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>6<\/sup>Department of Gastric Surgery, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>7<\/sup>Department of Medical Oncology and General Medicine, IMSUT Hospital, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7e3f2702-d05c-489e-8a64-23f25594a461","ControlNumber":"2821","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

In pediatric oncology, the need for accurate record of serious symptoms while patients are at home is a challenge in outpatients' care. In a step towards collecting real-time events that happened during the outpatient follow up, we develop a smart phone application that can record data actively by patients or their guardians in situ and on time of its occurrence, which can improve the follow up process and facilitate a decision making by the physician that based on objective data more than subjective ones.

To this end, we have developed an <i>in vitro<\/i> functional genomics platform for the systematic characterization of gene dependency on drug targets using CRISPR\/Cas9 technology.<br \/>Methods: Retrospective pre-therapy samples were obtained for a cohort of AML patients who subsequently went onto therapy with a combination of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib plus chemotherapy (e.g. GCLAM). Unsorted primary tumor cells from these samples were transduced with lentivirus harboring Cas9 enzyme and an sgRNA library. This customized sgRNA library (Fx Heme) was designed to inhibit expression of genes encoding the targets of all FDA-approved oncology drugs, as well as internal positive and negative references. Transduced cells were harvested at multiple timepoints, and sgRNA distribution was assessed by amplicon sequencing of DNA barcodes. Changes in barcode abundance were quantitated and aggregated to calculate gene-level phenotype scores, enabling identification of gene dependencies. Dependency on targets of sorafenib was compared to clinical outcome (complete response (CR) without minimal residual disease (MRD), incomplete response, CR with MRD, or refractory) following treatment with sorafenib plus chemotherapy.<br \/>Results: Among the 22 AML patients analyzed, 14 reached CR and 8 were classified as incomplete responders (refractory or MRD). Gene dependency on sorafenib targets including FLT3, KIT, PDGFR, and all RAF isoforms was frequently observed (12\/22 cases). Among cases indicating any sorafenib target gene dependency, 5\/12 (42%) demonstrated dependence on 2 or more sorafenib target genes. Overall, Fx Heme achieved 78.6% sensitivity, 87.5% specificity, and 91.7% PPV for prediction of observed clinical outcome. In contrast, stratification based on FLT3 mutation (internal tandem duplication or tyrosine kinase domain mutation) demonstrated 64.3% sensitivity, 50% specificity, 69.2% PPV. In summary, our results establish feasibility of CRISPR-based Fx Heme comprehensive functional genomic profiling for AML precision medicine, and validate this approach in a retrospective study cohort. Functional genomics may contribute to more effective personalization of AML treatment by uncovering drug target dependencies not readily identified by conventional genomic profiling, in an unbiased, comprehensive and patient-specific fashion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-03 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CRISPR,Acute myeloid leukemia,Functional profiling,Sorafenib,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Stephane Corbel<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Karl Hodel<sup>2<\/sup>, Kathleen Tran<sup>2<\/sup>, Maci Meyers<sup>2<\/sup>, Jing Tong<sup>2<\/sup>, Michele Baltay<sup>2<\/sup>, Peter Kilfeather<sup>2<\/sup>, Yali Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Christian Schmedt<sup>2<\/sup>, Srinath Sampath<sup>2<\/sup>, Srihari Sampath<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Function Oncology, Inc., San Diego, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Function Oncology, San Diego, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7196f115-eb02-4c6a-b516-778526853ea8","ControlNumber":"5293","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

The treatment typically consists of surgical approaches; unfortunately, many anomalies cannot be cured. Therefore, the goal of the treatment is to control the lesion, and progression or recurrence after an intervention is no exception. In the last 15 years, tremendous progress in understanding the molecular basis of the disease has been made, with alterations in more than 40 genes proven to be causal in the disease pathogenesis. Interestingly, such alterations are also found in many human cancers, which recently raised the question of whether repurposing anti-cancer drugs could be utilized in this setting. Tissue biopsies from 38 patients with vascular anomalies have been analyzed using different approaches ranging from Sanger sequencing to NGS-based detection. In 31 patients, known causal alterations of either germline or somatic origin were found. For the remaining seven patients, sampling issues were considered a cause of the negative result. Given that most patients suffered from a venous type of malformation, most alterations were found in <i>TEK<\/i> and <i>PIK3CA<\/i> genes, which are commonly altered in this subgroup. Other findings included alterations of <i>KRAS<\/i>, <i>GLMN<\/i>, <i>PTEN,<\/i> or <i>IDH2 <\/i>genes. <i>TEK<\/i> gene mutations were predominantly located in exon 17, which encodes for a part of the tyrosine kinase domain of the protein, with frequent L914F substitution being found in 12 cases. Identified <i>PIK3CA<\/i> gene mutations were all well-characterized activating alterations described in cancer-related context. Based on an identification of either <i>TEK<\/i> or <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutation, 13 patients were administered targeted treatment using selective PI3K alpha subunit inhibitor alpelisib. For all patients, improvement in quality of life, lesion reduction and normalization of coagulation parameters was achieved. A deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of vascular anomalies can significantly contribute to patient stratification, identification of potential therapeutic targets, and overall better clinical management. At the same time, identifying potential therapeutic targets could lead to the administration of novel anti-cancer drugs within the concept of drug repurposing and better overall disease control compared to routinely used approaches. <i>Supported by the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic, grant nr.

BRCA1\/2 mutations increase risk of breast, ovarian, prostate and other cancers. BRCA1\/2 mutated tumor cells are sensitive to PARP inhibitors (PARPi), that cause DNA replication fork to collapse. Approximately 40% of patients develop PARPi resistance through different mechanisms. One of the mechanisms of PARPi resistance is through P13k\/Akt pathway activation. Imipridones are TRAIL-inducing compounds which are PERK-independent activators of the integrated stress response, and dual inhibitors of Akt\/ERK. We hypothesized that combining imipridones with PARPi would overcome PARPi resistance due to Akt activation. PARPi also sensitize various solid tumors to recombinant TRAIL and DR5 agonist antibodies thereby further suggesting possible synergies between imipridones and PARPi. Our lab previously showed efficacy of imipridone ONC201 in BRCA-deficient cancer cells and potential synergy with olaparib (2017 AACR annual meeting abstract), without further investigating potential synergistic mechanisms. We explored combination drug synergy of rucaparib (PARP inhibitor) and imipridones (ONC212 and ONC201) in BRCA1\/2-deficient breast, ovarian and prostate cancer cell lines. CellTiterGLO viability assays were performed after 72 hours to demonstrate synergistic effects of combination treatment. Western blots were performed to investigate the effect of combination treatment on the Akt pathway, as well as expression of cellular metabolic stress protein ATF4. Cytokine profiling using the Luminex 200 technology was used to study the effect of treatment on the tumor microenvironment. Combination treatment (rucaparib and ONC212, rucaparib and ONC201) in BRCA&#8211;deficient cell lines (HCC1937, PEO1, KURAMOCHI, 22RV1, LNCAP) showed synergistic reduction in cell viability. In the HCC 1937 cell line, combination studies of rucaparib-ONC212 and rucaparib-ONC201 showed a synergystic effect, as calculated by Compusyn software, combination indexes below one were observed at concentration of 0.29-37.5 of &#181;M rucaparib with ONC201 at 1.25-5 &#181;M and ONC212 6.25-50 nM with the best combination index of 0.7 for rucaparib-ONC201 combination and 0.31 for rucaparib-ONC212. We similarly observed synergy in other cell lines with combination treatment. Western blot analysis of rucaparib-ONC212 combination showed total Akt protein reduction and an increase in ATF4 consistent with the synergistic effects. Further studies are ongoing to characterize possible mechanisms and effects of PARP inhibitor-imipridone combination treatment on immune-mediated killing. Our findings identify novel PARP inhibitor-imipridone therapy combinations that can be further developed for treatment of BRCA1\/2 deficient cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-03 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Imipridone,BRCA1,BRCA2,PARP inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maryam Ghandali<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kelsey  E.

Several trial matching software platforms have been developed to match genomic data from patients with PM trials, but these existing platforms are proprietary and are not easily accessible for adoption by institutions. At Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), we have addressed this challenge by developing our own open-source institutional trial matching software, MatchMiner. MatchMiner algorithmically matches patient genomic and clinical data with PM trial eligibility data. Trial eligibility data is manually curated into a human-readable markup language, called clinical trial markup language (CTML), for matching with patient genomic data. MatchMiner has 2 main modes of clinical use: (1) patient-centric, where clinicians search for trial matches for individual patients and (2) trial-centric, where trial staff identify patients that match their trial&#8217;s genomic eligibility.<br \/>We recently described MatchMiner&#8217;s usage at DFCI and since our report, we have added 90 additional trial consents facilitated by MatchMiner (&#62;250 trial consents, called MatchMiner consents [MMC]). Here, we describe new characteristics of our MMC including which user mode (patient-centric or trial-centric) was used to match the consent, genomic alterations and cancer types that matched to eligibility criteria, and whether the patient went onto trial. MMCs were mostly identified by patient-centric mode (70%), genomic alterations and cancer types among MMC were diverse (n=55 genes and n=20 cancer types), and 87% of MMC went on trial. Among MMCs, the most common altered genes leading to trial eligibility were ERBB2 and KRAS in breast cancer and lung cancer, which is consistent with the number of therapies targeting ERBB2 and KRAS. MMCs also included patients with rare cancer types, like extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, as well as rare genomic alterations, such as NTRK fusions. Thus, MatchMiner has been successful at facilitating PM trial matching for a broad range of genomic alterations and cancer types at DFCI.<br \/>MatchMiner matches patients to trials as soon as their genomic report is available, however, many patients are not yet ready to enroll onto a trial because their cancer is responding to the standard of care or they are in a remission period. To address this problem, we are evaluating the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to identify patients that may be ready for a new treatment option. After trial matches have been generated by MatchMiner, radiology scan text from patients&#8217; tumor scans is run through a natural language processing (NLP) model to identify patients who are more likely to be ready to enroll onto a trial. By using NLP to filter trial matches, we hope to improve MatchMiner&#8217;s efficiency of finding trial matches and provide more timely trial options for patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-03 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Targeted therapy,Genomics,Phase I,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Harry Klein<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Tali Mazor<sup><\/sup>, Matthew Galvin<sup><\/sup>, Jason Hansel<sup><\/sup>, Emily Mallaber<sup><\/sup>, Pavel Trukhanov<sup><\/sup>, Joyce Yu<sup><\/sup>, James Lindsay<sup><\/sup>, Kenneth Kehl<sup><\/sup>, Michael Hassett<sup><\/sup>, Ethan Cerami<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"19dd63b0-bb55-49ea-b6f9-ad1b96ea6cbe","ControlNumber":"6670","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

Despite being a common and well-known feature of cancer, this cancer hallmark has not yet been broadly explored therapeutically in the clinic. We present a novel precision-cancer approach, KLIPP, which consists of guide RNAs that target cancer-specific structural variant junctions (SVJs) to nucleate two parts of dCas9-conjugated endonuclease, Fok1, leading to its activation and induction of toxic DSBs. Furthermore, this approach reduced tumor growth in an orthotopic bladder cancer model in mice.<br \/><b>Methods and Materials: <\/b>HCT116 colon cancer cells and UMUC3 bladder cancer cells were engineered to express combinations of SVJ-targeting sgRNAs and express Fok1-dCas9 under doxycycline (dox) regulation. The HCT116 and UMUC3 cells were treated with dox for 24 hours and assessed for DSBs at SVJs by &#947;H2AX foci assay and &#947;H2AX ChIP-PCR. The cells were assessed for cell death using flow cytometry measuring sub-G<sub>1<\/sub> DNA content, the clonogenic survival assay (12 days), and PARP1 and caspase cleavage (after 48 h) using Western blot. Tumor growth of orthotopic xenografts of UMUC3 cells expressing Fok1-dCas9 alone or with 2 pairs of SVJ-targeting sgRNAs were assessed weekly after addition of dox to the drinking water. Bioluminescence assessment of tumor growth was monitored weekly.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Expression of SVJ-targeting sgRNA and the induction of Fok1-dCas9 by dox for 24 h in HCT116 colon cancer and UMUC3 bladder cancer cells, resulted in one or two &#947;H2AX foci per cell. Using ChIP-PCR, the identity of the site of the DSB was validated to occur at the targeted SVJ. Furthermore, dox treatment for 12 days caused &#62;50% reduced clonogenic survival that was augmented by the DNA-PK inhibitor NU7441. Further, we observed &#62;50% induction of apoptosis when assessed by subG<sub>1<\/sub> DNA content cells and PARP1 cleavage. When UMUC3 cancer cells were grown orthotopically in mice, activation of Fok1-dCas9 and together with two pairs of SVJ-targeting sgRNAs led to significantly reduced tumor growth with 7\/11 mice showing no signs of tumor.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> We have developed a precision CRISPR approach based on the homodimerization of Fok1 endonuclease at sites of cancer specific SVJs to specifically induce toxic DSBs in cancer cells. Here we show that this approach led to efficient targeting of cancer cells both in cell culture and <i>in vivo<\/i>. We are currently testing the efficacy of the KLIPP approach in preclinical models of bladder and ovarian cancers using lipid nanoparticle delivery techniques. On successfully implementation of this approach, it will be transformative for cancer therapy. Further, KLIPP will be generated in a personalized way for each patient in a rapid and cost-effective way.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-03 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Colon cancer,CRISPR,Structural Variants,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Radhika Suhas Hulbatte<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Huibin Yang<sup><\/sup>, Natalie Gratsch<sup><\/sup>, Alan Kellher<sup><\/sup>, Phillip  L.

With the development of next-generation sequencing, the field of precision oncology has been expanded to tailor treatments to a patient's mutational profile, however, there is a need for additional information such as RNA Differential Expression (DE) to match more patients to potentially beneficial drugs. We have previously described our PATRIOT platform, which integrates RNA DE analysis, NGS, and high throughput patient-derived organoid models to identify new therapeutic targets. In our previous study, we tested the PATRIOT platform on a patient with predicted KRAS and IDHI inactivation resulting in inhibition of DNA damage repair pathway. Patient-derived tumor organoids showed a significant response to the suggested treatment, Olaparib, supporting the reliability of PATRIOT prediction. To further validate this platform, we interrogated the predictive efficacy of PATRIOT in cohorts of patients characterized by CDKN2A downregulation or MET overexpression.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Following PATRIOT analysis,<b> <\/b>patients with predicted CDKN2A downregulation or MET overexpression consisting primarily of colon and pancreatic cancer were grouped into two cohorts<b>. <\/b>Patient-derived tumor organoids were tested for sensitivity to drugs matched to the predicted targets as single agent or in combination, using a 4-fold dilution followed by 72h viability assay.<b> <\/b>Drug cytotoxicity and Bliss Synergy were analyzed using GraphPad Prism and Combenefit. All screenings were subjected to stringent quality control measures and normalized against untreated organoids.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our analysis identified patients characterized by MET overexpression suggesting crizotinib, a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the c-MET receptor, as sequencing-matched therapy. Tumor organoids showed sensitivity to crizotinib (IC50 5.74 M+\/- 3.2), validating our initial predictions. In a separate cohort, tumor organoids generated from patients characterized by downregulation of CDKN2A were treated with Palbociclib, a CDK4\/6 inhibitor. Tumor organoids showed limited response to treatment (IC50 57.75 M+\/- 25.1), which has been reported in an earlier clinical trial (NCT01740427). However, recent studies have shown that Pablociclib treatment enhances cisplatin cytotoxic effect in several solid tumor models through the CDK4\/6-cyclin D1-RB-E2F pathway (NCT02897375). When tumor organoids were co-treated with Palbociclib and Cisplatin, significant synergy was observed (moderate-strong). In summary, PATRIOT analysis provided bioinformatic predictions of pathway based therapeutic options that were validated using tumor organoid platforms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-03 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,Precision medicine,Preclinical testing,Differential gene expression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anna Larson<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Taylor Bargenquast<sup><\/sup>, Sara Byron<sup><\/sup>, Anish Raju<sup><\/sup>, Avijit Podder<sup><\/sup>, Shelby Rheinschmidt<sup><\/sup>, Tithi Ghosh Halder<sup><\/sup>, Samuel Sampson<sup><\/sup>, Sydney Adamson<sup><\/sup>, Serina Ng<sup><\/sup>, Kate Gutowsky<sup><\/sup>, Alexis Weston<sup><\/sup>, Trason Thode<sup><\/sup>, Justin Moser<sup><\/sup>, Erkut Borazanci<sup><\/sup>, Mohan Kaadige<sup><\/sup>, Nicholas Schork<sup><\/sup>, Raffaella Soldi<sup><\/sup>, Sunil Sharma<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>TGen (The Translational Genomics Research Institute), Phoenix, AZ","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3af94a0f-02c0-4088-b574-f9329218a295","ControlNumber":"7589","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

There are 268,490 estimated new cases and 34,500 estimated deaths in 2022 according to the NIH. Patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) have a poor prognosis and the current treatment options show limited efficacy. From the TRAP trial, 20% of mCRPC patients are reported to bear DNA repair defects. Ceralasertib, formerly known as AZD6738, is a potent and selective orally bioavailable inhibitor of the ataxia tenlangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase, which is involved in DNA repair in response to DNA damage and replication stress. Ceralasertib&#8217;s antitumor activity as a monotherapy in treating prostate cancer is moderate. Thus, we investigated a combination therapy of ceralasertib with ONC201, a potent and cytotoxic orally bioavailable inhibitor of the serine\/threonine protein kinase Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Upon administration, ONC201 can induce tumor cell apoptosis mediated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and activate integrated stress response (IRS). Preliminary results demonstrate synergistic activity with the combination therapy <i>in vitro<\/i> using CellTiterGLO viability assay 72 hours in a 96 well plate post treatment. Ongoing studies using western blotting and cytokine profiling are intended to illustrate the mechanism behind the proven synergy. Our results aim to solve the overarching need in developing novel therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance in current prostate cancer treatments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antitumor effect,ATR,ONC201,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yutong Xia<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Maximilian  P.

Deletion of VHL stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor alpha protein (HIF&#945;) to drive the hypoxic transcriptional response, including induction of VEGF and PDGF2 that mediate tumor angiogenesis. Anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as sunitinib and axitinib have demonstrated therapeutic benefit in patients with ccRCC by exploiting the critical dependency of ccRCC tumors on the vasculature for oxygen, nutrients, and growth factors. However, resistance to TKIs is commonly observed, leading to clinical relapse. Here, we report that the combination of the farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI), tipifarnib, and any of several anti-angiogenic TKIs results in deeper and more durable responses in the VHL-mutant 786-O CDX model and an RCC PDX model, compared to TKI alone. While the anti-angiogenic TKIs or tipifarnib alone merely slowed or occasionally arrested tumor growth, the TKI-tipifarnib combination induced marked tumor regressions in all treated animals. To investigate the mechanism of action, VHL-mutant RCC cell lines were subjected to hypoxia (1% O<sub>2<\/sub>) <i>in vitro<\/i> to mimic the hypoxic conditions induced by TKIs <i>in vivo<\/i> and were treated with tipifarnib to evaluate tipifarnib&#8217;s impact on signaling pathways in hypoxia-exposed cells. In the Caki2 cell line, hypoxia initially reduced mTOR signaling, but it rebounded strongly after 24 hours in hypoxia, suggesting that mTOR pathway reactivation is a potential mechanism of resistance to TKIs. Addition of tipifarnib blocked hypoxia-induced mTOR reactivation. Mechanistically, tipifarnib potently inhibits the farnesylation, and hence the activity, of an obligate farnesylated protein RHEB, a positive regulator of mTOR, suggesting that the synergy may arise through RHEB inhibition in this model. The mechanistic data in cell lines suggest that tipifarnib&#8217;s ability to inhibit mTOR reactivation observed in ccRCC cell lines under hypoxic stress contributes to the enhanced treatment durability observed <i>in vivo<\/i>. Because FTIs are pleiotropic drugs, there are likely additional cell intrinsic mechanisms that may influence synergy with TKIs. Further <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> studies are underway to establish the scope and mechanistic underpinnings of TKI-tipifarnib effects and strengthen the therapeutic rationale for combining TKIs with tipifarnib in the treatment of patients with ccRCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Renal cell carcinoma,mTOR,Antiangiogenic TKI,Farnesyltransferase inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jovylyn Gatchalian<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Linda Kessler<sup><\/sup>, Stacia Chan<sup><\/sup>, Francis Burrows<sup><\/sup>, Shivani Malik<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Kura Oncology, San Diego, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"dbf0b6f6-fce3-448a-bb77-09a9318c4ef5","ControlNumber":"6634","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

KRAS mutations occur in about 40-50% of mCRC and are associated with more aggressive drug resistance and lack of response to anti-EGFR therapies. Recent advances have led to small molecules targeting KRAS G12C that have been undergoing clinical testing in lung, mCRC, and other tumor types. ONC212 is a fluorinated imipridone with strong anti-cancer activity in nM range and preclinical efficacy against pancreatic and other malignancies. Through extensive structure-based drug design, MRTX1133 was identified as a noncovalent, potent, and selective inhibitor of KRASG12D. MRTX1133 suppresses KRASG12D signaling in cells and in vivo, MRTX1133 binds to the switch II pocket and inhibits the protein-protein interactions necessary for activation of the KRAS pathway.<br \/>MATERIALS &#38; METHODS: We investigated cell viability and drug synergies of 5-FU or ONC212 plus KRAS G12D inhibitor MRTX1133 in 6 human CRC and 4 human pancreatic cancer cell lines at 72 hours. Experiments evaluated drug effects on pERK using western blot at 6 and 24 hours. We evaluated changes at 48 hours in cytokine profiles in treated cells using a custom panel of 62 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors associated with tumor growth, immune stimulation or immune suppression.<br \/>RESULTS: Colorectal and pancreatic cancer cell lines had IC50 sensitivities ranging from 7 to 12 microM for 5-FU 0.2-0.8 microM for ONC212, &#62;100 nM to &#62;5,000 nM for MRTX1133 (G12D N=4: LS513 &#62;100, HPAF-II &#62;1,000, SNUC2B &#62;5,000, PANC-1 &#62;5,000). For non-G12D, the range of IC50 for MRTX1133 was &#62;1,000 to &#62;5,000 nM for CRC lines with G12V, G13D, or WT KRAS (N=7). Synergies between MRTX1133 and either 5-FU or ONC212 were observed across cell lines regardless of the presence of KRAS G12D mutation with combination indices of &#60;0.5 indicating strong synergy. The observed synergy was greater with the combination of MRTX1133 and ONC212 compared to the synergy with 5-FU. Among the cytokine alterations, IL8\/CXCL8, MICA, Angiopoietin 2, VEGF and TNF-alpha were reduced while IL-18\/IL-1F4 increased with all treatments.<br \/>CONCLUSIONS: Our ongoing studies reveal the potential activity of MRTX1133 against mCRC and pancreatic cancer cells regardless of KRAS G12D mutation and synergies were observed with 5-FU and ONC212 regardless of KRAS G12D mutation. Immune stimulatory cytokine profiles were observed with 5-FU, MRTX1133 and combination. The results suggest that KRAS G12D, KRAS G13D and WT KRAS should not be excluded from clinical trials especially with combination therapies involving MRTX1133 and standard-of-care 5-FU.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,Colorectal cancer,KRAS,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Vida Tajiknia<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Wafik El-Deiry<sup>1<\/sup>, Maximilian Pinho Schwermann<sup>1<\/sup>, Lanlan Zhou<sup>2<\/sup>, Kelsey Huntington<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Legorreta Cancer Center at Brown University, Providence, RI,<sup>2<\/sup>Legorreta Cancer Center at Brown University, Providence, RI","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bde6c397-6a1b-42c5-b6ac-47c9627be977","ControlNumber":"6213","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>V.

The current standard treatment methods of HCC has included with general surgery, radiation, etc. However, the recurrence rate remain high even after standard treatment, it is necessary to find a better treatment option to control the progression of HCC. Lenvatinib is a multi-endothelial angiogenesis factor inhibitor which is a first-line target drug for the treatment of advanced HCC. Some studies indicated that activation of the PI3K\/AKT pathway could lead to the resistance effect of lenvatinib in HCC. 18&#946;-glycyrrhetinic acid (18&#946;-GA) is a hydrolyzed product of glycyrrhizic acid in the intestine. Studies reported that 18&#946;-GA can effectively treat inflammatory diseases and may have antitumor potential. Some studies also indicated that 18&#946;-GA can down-regulate the signaling transduction of PI3K\/AKT pathway in various type of cancers. Therefore, in this study, we focused on exploring whether 18&#946;-GA can be used as an adjuvant to downregulate PI3K\/AKT signaling and thus enhance the efficacy of lenvatinib on HCC cells and animal model. Here, we used the MTT assay to investigate the cytotoxicity of HCC cells (Huh7 and Hep3B) after various dose of lenvatinib and (or) 18&#946;-GA treatment. We also used combination index (CI) to evaluate the suitable combination condition. In our results, the CI value of lenvatinib 30 &#956;M combined with 18&#946;-GA 100 &#956;M is smaller than 1, which indicated the synergistic effect of combination. We confirmed the superior extrinsic\/intrinsic apoptosis induction ability was found in lenvatinib combined with 18&#946;-GA as compared to single treatment. The activation of Fas\/FasL pathway, Annexin V, cleaved caspase-3, -8 and -9 were used to confirm the apoptosis induction by lenvatinib combined with 18&#946;-GA. Transwell invasion and wound healing assays results also indicated the invasion\/migration suppression ability of lenvatinib combined with 18&#946;-GA on HCC cells. The phosphorylation of AKT were markedly decreased by lenvatinib combined with 18&#946;-GA in HCC cells . Hep3B bearing animal data proved the superior tumor control of lenvatinib combined with 18&#946;-GA. Additionally, the liver function and normal tissue pathology may not affect by combination of lenvatinib and 18&#946;-GA. To conclude, our result demonstrated that 18&#946;-GA may sensitize HCC to lenvatinib via inactivation of PI3K\/AKT signaling pathway and induction of extrinsic\/intrinsic apoptosis signaling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Lenvatinib,18&#946;-glycyrrhetinic acid,PI3K\/AKT signaling pathway,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yeh Pei-Wen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yu-Chiang Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Yuan Chang<sup>3<\/sup>, Jiann-Hwa Chen<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>China Medical University, Taichung City, Taiwan,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Radiation Oncology, Chang Bing Show Chwan Memorial Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Medical Imaging, Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, New Taipei City, Taiwan,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Emergency Medicine, Cathay General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"99d72e06-bdc1-4f80-b6d5-4cd9609aa239","ControlNumber":"3329","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Therefore, anti-KRAS therapies are expected to make a significant impact on the treatment of this deadly cancer, where there are currently no effective targeted therapies. Supporting this premise, early clinical trial results with KRAS<sup>G12C <\/sup>inhibitors have shown promising disease control rates (84-100%) in KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>-mutant PDAC. Despite these observations, two key issues limit the impact of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors in PDAC. First, KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>(OFF)<sup> <\/sup>mutations comprise less than 2% of KRAS mutations in PDAC. Second, patients initially responsive to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors invariably relapse due to treatment-induced resistance. To begin qualifying KRAS inhibitors that target KRAS mutations more frequently found in PDAC, we characterized a RAS inhibitor that targets the multiple KRAS mutations as well as wild-type RAS proteins. We evaluated the impact of this inhibitor on RAS signaling and anti-proliferative activity in KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancer human cell lines and in a panel of RASless MEFs (<i>ras<\/i>-null mouse embryo fibroblasts) stably expressing exogenous RAS mutant proteins that are commonly found in PDAC. To identify genetic mechanisms of resistance to KRAS inhibition in pancreatic cancer, we applied CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>-, KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>-, KRAS<sup>G12R<\/sup>-, and KRAS<sup>Q61H<\/sup>-mutant PDAC cells treated with KRAS inhibitors to identify genes that modulate KRAS inhibitor anti-proliferative activity.

Subsequently, this has led to the development of Androgen Signaling Inhibitors (ASI), specifically Enzalutamide (ENZ), which is a direct inhibitor of AR, to clinically manage CRPC. Inevitably, ENZ treatment only provides improvement for approximately two months before advancing to an incurable form, ENZ-resistant CRPC. With PCa ranking as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in USA males, there is an urgency and necessity for the discovery and development of novel therapeutic approaches for CRPC. Wnt signaling has been extensively documented in its involvement in PCa and the tumor microenvironment (TME), however the mechanism of how the Wnt signaling cascades contribute to ENZ resistance is still ambiguous. Recently we have published that the activation of the canonical Wnt pathway contributes to the progression of ENZ resistance in CRPC and using a combination of &#946;-catenin inhibitor with ENZ resulted in the synergistic inhibition of patient derived xenograft (PDX) tumor growth. Regarding the non-canonical Wnt pathway, we confirmed its contribution to invasion and migration which leads to metastasis in ENZ-resistant CRPC, and when the downstream effector ROCK is depleted or depleted ROCK cells are treated with ENZ, there is a significant hindering of cell migration and invasion. Also, utilizing a combination therapy of ROCK inhibitor with ENZ synergistically inhibited the growth of PDX tumors. Hence the reasoning that by simultaneously inhibiting both the canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling cascade will result in the inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The goal of this study was to define the mechanism of PORCN in ENZ-resistant CRPC and develop a therapeutic approach to combat this disease. My research has determined that Porcupine (PORCN) is associated with CRPC progression to ENZ-resistance, and that an inhibition or loss of PORCN has resulted in the regain of ENZ sensitivity in ENZ-resistant models. This model has also demonstrated that PORCN and Wnt signaling engage in a paramount role contributing to AR activation, promoting CRPC progression, and the development of ENZ resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Wnt signaling,Oxidative stress,Enzalutamide,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Katelyn Makayla Jones<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Xiaoqi Liu<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d5887403-7bc9-4f50-81b7-78d28340fbe9","ControlNumber":"3990","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

KRAS activates the MAPK pathway, promoting cell survival and increasing protein synthesis. Novel inhibitors of KRAS G12C mutation (sotorasib) have demonstrated short-lasting responses due to resistance mediated by the AKT-mTOR-P70S6K pathway. In this context, metformin is a promising candidate to avoid this inconvenience by inhibiting mTOR and P70S6K.<b> <\/b>Therefore, this project aimed to explore the effects of the combination of sotorasib and metformin on cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and the activity of the mTOR pathway in lung cancer cell lines with or without KRAS mutations.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We performed dose-effect curves to determine the IC50 concentration of sotorasib, and IC10 of metformin. Then, these doses were used to treat lung cancer cell lines A549 (KRAS G12S), H522 (without KRAS), and H23 (KRAS G12C). Cellular cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT assay, apoptosis induction through flow cytometry with Annexin V and 7AAD, and the activity of P70S6K and AKT proteins by western blot. Main outcomes and measures: cell survival, apoptosis, expression, and phosphorylation of intermediaries belonging to the mTOR pathway.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: The combined treatment showed a synergic effect on cytotoxicity, increased apoptosis induction, and notable inhibition of AKT and P70S6K1 proteins, compared to sotorasib alone or to control groups in all the cell lines, but predominantly in KRAS-mutated cells (H23 and A549).<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: The combination of metformin with sotorasib showed synergic effects on cytotoxicity, increased apoptosis induction, and a remarkable inhibition of downstream proteins involved in the signaling of growth factor receptors in all tested cells.

Resistance mechanisms include feedback reactivation of compensatory, oncogenic signaling pathways and the attainment of a drug-tolerant state, each of which allows cancer cells to survive the anti-tumor effects of these highly active drugs. Compensatory mechanisms ameliorating KRAS blockade include HRAS\/NRAS and the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Tipifarnib is a clinical stage farnesyltransferase inhibitor known to inhibit multiple farnesylation-dependent proteins in tumor cells. We have recently shown that tipifarnib can prevent feedback-mediated adaptive resistance to the PI3K&#945; inhibitor, alpelisib, through inhibition of both HRAS and RHEB, allowing simultaneous blockade of two key nodes of the oncogenic MAPK- and PI3K-signaling pathways. In another example, tipifarnib has been demonstrated by others to inhibit the ability of tumor cells to enter a drug-tolerant state induced by the EGFR inhibitor, osimertinib, in EGFR-mutant NSCLC models. In these models, inhibition of farnesylation of certain RHO proteins appear to contribute to the death of drug-tolerant cells prior to the emergence of acquired resistance mutations. Building on these two mechanisms of how tipifarnib may prevent adaptive resistance, we propose that tipifarnib can be used as an effective partner drug to delay or prevent the onset of adaptive resistance to KRAS G12C inhibitors. We have conducted <i>in vitro <\/i>2D and 3D viability and regrowth experiments using combinations of tipifarnib with KRAS G12C inhibitors and have observed synergistic, anti-proliferative effects in KRAS G12C NSCLC cell lines as well as enhanced activity of combination in a KRAS G12C NSCLC PDX model.

Despite existing therapeutics such as neoadjuvant radiotherapy, 5-year survival outcomes remain low at ~60%. Rectal tumors are heterogeneous and underpinned by dysregulated cellular signaling. This study aimed to investigate the IL6\/JAK\/STAT3 pathway as a prognostic biomarker in RC and explore the therapeutic potential of JAK inhibitors using <i>in vitro\/ex vivo<\/i> models.<br \/>Methods: A retrospective RC cohort (n=206) was stained via immunohistochemistry for IL6\/JAK\/STAT3 pathway members. Staining intensity was quantified and scores were analyzed for association with survival outcomes and clinicopathological characteristics. In a prospective RC cohort, the effect of radiation on IL6\/JAK\/STAT3 signaling was investigated in serially collected pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies at the transcriptomic and protein level. Drug screening of repurposed JAK inhibitors (alone and in combination with radiation) was performed in cell lines (DLD-1, HCT116, HT29, SW620), mouse organoids (AKPT and KPN) and patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Responses were measured using WST-1 assays, clonogenics, and immunofluorescent staining for markers of proliferation.<br \/>Results: High tumoral expression of pSTAT3<sup>tyr705<\/sup> was associated with reduced cancer-specific survival (CSS) in RC patients with stroma-rich tumors (<i>HR=1.781, 95%CI; 1.419-2.236, p=0.001<\/i>)<i>. <\/i>Similarly, high tumoral expression of JAK2 in stroma-rich cases was associated with reduced CSS (<i>HR=1.854, 95%CI; 1.287-2.671, p=0.001<\/i>). A significant increase in <i>IL6\/JAK\/STAT3 <\/i>gene signatures was observed at 2- and 6- weeks post treatment induction compared to baseline in rectal biopsy specimens (n=3). <i>In vitro<\/i>, JAK inhibition with 10&#181;M AZD1480 or Ruxolitinib significantly reduced viability of cell lines HCT116 (p=0.018) and SW620 (p=0.050). When AZD1480 was combined with 0-8Gy of radiation, colony formation was significantly reduced upon combination treatment compared to vehicle controls in a dose-dependent manner and linear quadratic modelling showed a synergistic effect of combined treatment in HT29 (p=0.004) and SW620 lines (p=0.014). AKPT, KPN and a subset of PDOs showed a significant reduction in cell viability, proliferation and increased apoptosis following JAK inhibition.<br \/>Conclusion: This study represented a step towards establishing the role of JAK inhibition as a therapeutic approach for RC. Ongoing research aims to validate the synergistic effect of combining JAK inhibition with radiation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"JAK,Radiosensitization,Organoids,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kathryn  A.

GBM is the most common and malignant primary brain cancer in adults. GBM has a dismal prognosis of death within 6 months if left untreated, thus there is a clinically unmet need for new and effective treatments. CK1epsilon has been identified as a GBM survival kinase gene. CK1epsilon promotes growth of GBM cells by inhibiting &#946;-catenin. However, blocking CK1epsilon alone fails to completely block tumor growth perhaps because &#946;-catenin can be regulated by other kinases. PIK3CB\/p110&#946; is another GBM survival kinase gene which also acts upstream of &#946;-catenin. As seen with CK1epsilon, blocking PIK3CB\/p110&#946; alone also fails to completely block tumor growth. It is possible that blocking either CK1epsilon or PIK3CB\/p110&#946; alone does not substantially activate &#946;-catenin to induce massive GBM cell death, thus limiting their therapeutic efficacy as a single agent. It is therefore imperative to investigate if co-targeting CK1epsilon and PIK3CB\/p110&#946; yields a synergistic inhibitory effect on GBM cell growth.<br \/>GBM cells were treated with either DMSO (control), IC261 (chemical inhibitor of CK1epsilon), AZD6482 (chemical inhibitor of PIK3CB\/p110&#946;), or both IC261 and AZD6482. Cell viability was measured using the MTS viability assay. Cell viability for the treatment groups were as follows: AZD6482 (88.81%), IC261 (66.78%), and combination of AZD6482+IC261 (42.59%). Statistical analysis of drug synergy using the Bliss independence model yielded an Excess Over Bliss score greater than 0%, indicating a synergistic effect. To further elucidate the mechanism of GBM cell death, immunoblotting will also be performed to detect &#946;-catenin activity after inhibition of CK1epsilon and PIK3CB\/p110&#946;. Overall, preliminary results show that co-inhibition of CK1epsilon and PIK3CB\/p110&#946; with chemical inhibitors yields synergistic GBM cell death.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Synergism,Combination therapy,Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Eileen Xu<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Fralin Biomedical Research Institute, Roanoke, VA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"518411e5-d2a2-4dd8-8209-d5bc12399a9a","ControlNumber":"5956","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>E.

Despite recent advances in medical oncology research, chemo- and radiotherapy are still the standard of care treatments for recurrent or metastatic EC and prognosis for these patients remains poor, with median survival rates of less than one year. Approximately 15-30% of the more common type I EC harbors oncogenic KRAS mutations, which have been linked to disease progression. Preclinical studies have shown that MEK inhibitors exhibit strong anti-tumor activity in KRAS mutant EC models. In the clinical setting however, MEKi monotherapy has proven unsuccessful in KRAS mutant EC patients, suggesting that combinations with other targeted agents may be needed to achieve increased signaling modulation and enhanced therapeutic activity. As suggested by our previous work in KRAS mutant lung, colorectal and pancreatic cancer, the combined inhibition of MEK and SOS1 may overcome adaptive resistance to MEKi by blocking SOS1-mediated reactivation of MAPK signaling. We evaluated whether this hypothesis can also be applied in the context of EC. Here we treated preclinical models of EC with a combination of clinically relevant doses of a MEKi (trametinib) and BI-3406, a potent and selective orally bioavailable SOS1 inhibitor. Treatment of KRAS mutant EC cells resulted in decreased activity of the KRAS-MAPK pathway, as measured by ERK phosphorylation. This effect was further enhanced by co-treatment with BI-3406. In vivo, the combination of MEKi with SOS1i synergistically decreased tumor growth in two KRAS G12D mutant orthotopic patient-derived xenograft models of EC. The anti-tumor effect of the combination was comparable to the effect of paclitaxel, the standard of care treatment in EC. This suggests that the combination of MEKi with SOS1i may be a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of EC patients with tumors harboring KRAS mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Endometrial cancer,MEK inhibitor,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kaja Kostyrko<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Melanie Hinkel<sup><\/sup>, Marco  H.

The aggressive growth and high resistance against cytotoxic agents are mediated by ultra-long tubular membrane protrusions, Tumor Microtubes (TMs), that interconnect single glioblastoma cells via gap junctions to multicellular communicating and resistant networks. Early studies showed that targeting these malignant networks increases response to therapy. Thus, the disconnection of such networks has emerged as a new therapeutic strategy to decrease radioresistance. However, the development of drugs that interfere with TM- and network formation is compromised by the lack of established drug screening pipelines to study a compound&#8216;s specific anti-TM and network-inhibiting activity in combination with radiotherapy. To identify compounds with anti-TM activity, we first developed an <i>in vitro<\/i> medium-throughput imaging-based drug screening. Human-derived primary glioblastoma cells were seeded in a newly developed 2D monolayer where tumor cells form TMs and networks. The cells were treated with compounds with potential anti-TM activity. Using high-resolution laser scanning microscopy, morphological readouts were obtained and analyzed. The most promising compounds were then evaluated in a xenograft chronic cranial window mouse model. Treatments were administered with concomitant radiotherapy (6Gy per day for 3 days). By observing TM and tumor cell network changes via longitudinal <i>in vivo<\/i> 2-photon microscopy, tumor cell count, growth, and TM parameters were measured in the live mouse over up to 12 weeks. Among the 87 compounds tested <i>in vitro<\/i>, 42 significantly inhibited TMs. Two of these hits showed a higher count of dead cells in combination with radiotherapy as opposed to glioblastoma cells treated with radiotherapy alone and were therefore studied in the <i>in vivo<\/i> pipeline. One of these two agents showed reductions of TM length and striking responses in a combinatorial treatment regime with radiotherapy in individual mice that were not observed in control animals treated with radiotherapy only; however, the responses observed were heterogeneous between regions and mice. Further studies revealed this compound directly phosphorylates the gap junction protein Connexin 43 on S368, which contributes to a decrease in intercellular communication of glioblastoma cells. By applying different imaging techniques and AI algorithms we successfully established a novel <i>in<\/i><i>-<\/i><i>vitro<\/i>-to-<i>in<\/i><i>-<\/i><i>vivo<\/i> drug screening pipeline for the development of disconnecting agents. Most importantly, our data shows that disconnecting multicellular brain tumor networks increases response to radiotherapy. Further studies will be needed to develop reliable anti-TM agents as novel co-treatment options to sensitize glioblastomas to cytotoxic therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Drug discovery,Machine learning,Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Daniel D.
