[{"Abstract":"Chromosome 11q23 translocations are present in ~10% of acute leukemia, which generate the oncogenic MLL fusion (MLL-r hereinafter) proteins and drive a subset of aggressive leukemia. Mechanistic studies of MLL-r leukemias implicated several complexes involved in RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription: the Super Elongation Complex (SEC), the DOT1L Complex (DotCom) and the Polymerase Associated Factor 1 Complex (PAF1c). These protein complexes are dysregulated in MLL-r leukemias and amplify transcription of pro-leukemic target genes. The proteins ENL and AF9 are two common MLL fusion partners and share high homology within their N-terminal YEATS domains that function as epigenetic reader domains. Recently, the importance of the wild type ENL (but not AF9) and its epigenetic reader function has been demonstrated in acute leukemias. However, the importance of the YEATS domain in the context of MLL-ENL fusions has not been explored. In patients, we found that most MLL-ENL fusions (84.1%; N=302 patients), but not MLL-AF9 fusions, retain the YEATS domain. These findings prompted us to investigate 1) how the YEATS domain contributes to MLL-ENL leukemogenesis, 2) whether the YEATS domain affects MLL-ENL fusion protein functions, and 3) if YEATS domain presence in MLL-ENL fusion exposes a vulnerability to YEATS inhibitors. Using published YEATS epigenetic reader mutations, we found that the YEATS epigenetic reader function significantly contributes to MLL-ENL leukemogenesis. Disrupting the YEATS epigenetic reader function in MLL-ENL fusion proteins significantly impacts leukemic stem cell frequency. Using an MLL-ENL construct relevant in patients (&#916;YEATS hereinafter), we discovered a subset of MLL-ENL targets with altered expression. GSEA revealed several gene signatures enriched in &#916;YEATS cells, most interestingly genes downregulated in leukemic stem cells. Specifically, the MLL-ENL target <i>Eya1 <\/i>is severely disrupted in MLL-ENL YEATS epigenetic reader mutants and &#916;YEATS cells. Our mechanistic data suggest that while MLL-ENL binding at <i>Eya1 <\/i>is impacted in &#916;YEATS, YEATS epigenetic reader mutants do not significantly alter MLL-ENL and PAF1c localization. However, YEATS epigenetic reader mutations severely impact epigenetic modifications associated with active transcription, including H3K4me3, H3K9ac and H3K79me2 at the <i>Eya1<\/i> locus. Finally, we tested the YEATS inhibitor sensitivity in AML cell lines. We found that the cell line HB1119, which is driven by MLL-ENL fusion with an intact YEATS domain, is among the most sensitive lines to the YEATS inhibitor SGC-iMLLT. Together, our study provides the biological and mechanistic characterizations of the YEATS domain in MLL-ENL leukemias and contributes to the theoretical framework for YEATS inhibitor development in the majority of MLL-ENL patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute myeloid,Epigenetics,Fusion proteins,YEATS domain,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hsiangyu Hu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nirmalya Saha<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuting Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Ejaz Ahmad<sup>1<\/sup>, Lauren Lachowski<sup>1<\/sup>, Uttar Shrestha<sup>1<\/sup>, Vidhya Premkumar<sup>1<\/sup>, James  P.

The variety and limited characterization of genomic mechanisms underlying this disease presents a unique challenge for the development of improved treatments for these patients. Using the 10x Genomics Chromium system, we have generated single-cell gene expression (scRNA) and chromatin accessibility (scATAC) data for blood and\/or bone marrow samples collected at diagnosis from eight pediatric T-ALL patients. We sequenced 21,669 high-confidence cells and performed normalization and downstream analysis using the Seurat v4.0.2 package in R 4.0.3. Our data show that patient cancer cells show highly individual transcriptomes and are often characterized by combinatorial expression patterns of genes including <i>MEF2C<\/i>, <i>BCL11B<\/i>, <i>HOXA9<\/i>, <i>NKX2-1<\/i>, and <i>LMO2<\/i>, which have been previously implicated for their roles in various T-ALL subtypes. Additionally, we observe that each patient has a unique ratio of cancer cells with a CD4+ T-cell, CD8+ T-cell, and hematopoietic stem cell-like identity, which may be linked to treatment response and patient outcome. This dataset represents one of the first forays into exploring the biology of pediatric T-ALL at the single-cell level. Our comparative analysis of patient cancer cells reveals novel insights into the transcriptional and chromatin-related for distinct subsets of pediatric T-ALL cases, paving the way for future treatment selection and drug development to improve outcomes for these patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,T cell,Single cell,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Irina Pushel<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Byunggil Yoo<sup><\/sup>, Daniel Louiselle<sup><\/sup>, Margaret Gibson<sup><\/sup>, Midhat  S.

Next generation sequencing of primary HR NB tumors identified an increase in activating mutations in the RAS\/RAF\/MAPK pathway. Moreover, gene set enrichment analyses showed a significant decrease in expression of genes suppressed by the Yes-Associated Protein (YAP) at relapse, suggesting increased YAP transcriptional repression. YAP binds with TEAD family transcription factors to regulate gene expression. We have shown that YAP promotes chemotherapy and MEK inhibitor resistance in RAS-mutated NB tumors <i>in vivo<\/i> by suppressing the expression of Harakiri (HRK), a BH3-only pro-apoptotic protein activated in response to tumor environmental stress such as serum starvation. Our overall objective is to elucidate how YAP represses HRK and tumor suppressor genes globally, and to enhance MEK inhibitor potency by combining MEK inhibition with agents that inhibit YAP or induce HRK to restore the tumor environmental stress response and apoptosis in RAS-mutated NB.<br \/><b>Design\/Methods: <\/b>We used publicly available databases to identify TEAD binding sites on the <i>HRK <\/i>gene locus in NB.

Tissue biopsy of Rb can cause tumor spread, so it is contraindicated. We demonstrated that aqueous humor (AH), an ocular fluid, is a high-yield liquid biopsy enabling in vivo detection of tumor-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) thus overcoming the contraindication of biopsy. Somatic genomic alterations, including both somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) and single nucleotide variations (SNVs) on RB1 gene, have been able to be identified in the same clinical samples but with two separate sequencing runs. In this study, we first developed a single targeted sequencing method to identify both SCNAs and RB1 SNVs. With this method, we further investigated the degree of genomic concordance between paired tumor and AH samples from the same Rb eye.<br \/>Materials and Methods: 11 paired AH and Rb tumor samples were included in the study. cfDNA of AH and tumor DNA of enucleated Rb eyes were isolated with QIAgen commercial kits. DNAs were constructed into whole genome libraries followed by hybridization target enrichment (Agilent SureSelect). The enrichment assay covers the whole length of RB1 and MycN genes, the all-exon regions of BCOR and CREBBP genes, and a whole genome CNV backbone. Libraries were submitted to Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform for fastq data generation with 2x150bp mode. The bioinformatics pipeline was optimized to generate SCNA profiles from targeted sequencing reads, along with SNV calling.<br \/>Results: For SCNA profiles, 11\/11 AH samples (100%) and 8\/11 tumor samples (72.72%) have positive RB-SCNA signatures. Strong concordances were observed between AH and tumor SCNA profiles (median = 90.1%) with targeted sequencing reads. In total, 9 disease-driving RB1 SNVs were identified in 6 patients (54.5%). 7\/9 (77.8%) of the variants were shared between AH and tumor samples, while the AH and tumor each contained one unique SNV. In all SNVs, the AH displayed a higher allele frequency. Notably, 4\/11 samples have focal RB1 gene deletion detected with SCNA profiling, which may explain the difficulties of RB1 SNV detection in some samples. Further, one case was driven by a MYCN gene amplification with no RB1 alterations.<br \/>Conclusions: This study presented highlights the utility of a single method to call both SVNs and SCNAs in a single clinical sample, with enriched tumor information detected in AH compared with tumor. This study further strengthens the utility of AH as a liquid biopsy platform for Rb eyes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Liquid biopsies,Pediatric cancers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Liya Xu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mike  J.

Aberrant chromatin accessibility triggered by abnormal activity of a variety of chromatin remodeling complexes is known to activate and maintain tumor proliferation. The most widely known of these complexes is the SWI\/SNF (also called BAF) complex. Studies have shown that BAF regulates chromatin accessibility in a more global manner and its long-term inhibition or functional loss may lead to non-specific downstream effects in both tumor and normal tissue. Thus, there is a need to further probe understudied complexes, such as the Imitation Switch (ISWI) family of chromatin remodelers, to find more cancer specific functions that can provide mechanistic insights that pave the way for novel therapeutic discoveries. We have examined the functions of these chromatin complex in different type of pediatric cancers to estsablish the pre-clinical rationale for potential novel pediatric cancer therapy. We discovered that fusion protein positive rhabdomyosarcoma (FP-RMS), an aggressive sub-type of RMS characterized by chromosomal translocations resulting in gene fusions between PAX3\/7 and FOXO1 is highly dependent on chromatin accessibility. This aggressive subtype exhibits a significant vulnerability in its dependence on the oncogenic transcription factor PAX3-FOXO1, yet like many other TFs, PAX3-FOXO1 is currently not considered a viable therapeutic candidate. We have then carefully examined the effect of chemical inhibition and chemical degradation of BAF complex function in FP-RMS and discovered that BAF complex globally regulates chromatin accessibility, is not specifically regulating FP function. We next examined the function of other chromatin remodeling complexes that might regulate FP function specifically in FP-RMS. We identified that some of other chromatin remodeling complex, such as Nuclear Remodeling Factor (NURF) complex, a member of the ISWI chromatin remodeling complex family, interacts with a critical fusion protein, PAX3\/7-FOXO1, in FP-RMS. There is limited understanding surrounding the functions of NURF complex, particularly in pediatric cancer. Here, we then studied the key functions of FP regulated by variety of chromatin remodeling complex utilizing combined chemistry and biology method to elaborate the essential functions of PAX3\/7-FOXO1 fusion protein. We have developed variety of chemical strategies to target these complexes, and utilize these tool compounds to delineate the chromatin remodeling complex regulated FP functions. This study showcased our approach to advance cancer research by combining the power of chemistry, chemical biology, structural biology, computational biology and cellular biology to identify novel mechanistic understanding as well as novel therapeutic approach for pediatric cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromatin remodeling,Epigenetics,Chemistry,Fusion proteins,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jun Qi<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d2d62c22-18dc-4964-8151-27889302199f","ControlNumber":"6572","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Current diagnostic methods involve imaging and tissue biopsy for staging, histology and fusion status assessment. There are presently no serum biomarkers for rhabdomyosarcoma diagnosis or surveillance. Novel approaches and identification of biomarkers are warranted for minimally invasive diagnostic\/surveillance techniques. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are recognized as critical mediators of intercellular communication and the pathophysiology of carcinogenesis and metastasis. This study aimed to characterize the proteome of rhabdomyosarcoma-derived EVs and identify proteomic signatures that correlate with clinical characteristics such as histological subtype, cancer stage, age and metastasis, using patient-derived cell lines. EVs were isolated from cell culture conditioned media by differential ultracentrifugation from four rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines (RH4, RH18, RH30, RD), each in triplicate. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified EV protein cargo. Proteins identified in our samples were compared to all available EV data in the Vesiclepedia database, using the FunRich software. We identified 1,527 total proteins in our rhabdomyosarcoma-derived EVs. When comparing to Vesiclepedia, 96 unique proteins were identified from our EVs that were not previously annotated in EVs within the database. Expression of these 96 proteins was further evaluated based on clinical characteristics of the tumors the cell lines were derived from. We found a four-protein signature in the EV secretome of rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines correlated with FOXO1 fusion-positive status. This signature includes proteins involved in regulating extracellular matrix organization, regulating gene expression, protein biosynthesis and translation. Rhabdomyosarcoma cells secrete EVs with unique protein cargo based on clinical characteristics of the parent tumor such as histological subtype and FOXO1 fusion status. Further validation of these secreted EV proteins in biological fluids could prove an effective liquid biopsy technique for novel diagnostic approaches or surveillance in pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-03 Pediatric cancer models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular vesicles,Rhabdomyosarcoma,Proteomic analysis,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Paula  R.

We examine the potential of stage restricted osteoblasts to induce fully penetrant osteosarcoma using osteoblast stage specific Cre mice to mutate Trp53. We identified three molecularly distinct subtypes of osteosarcoma induced by the same driver mutation. Our results suggest that the three subtypes arise from different subpopulations of osteoblasts. Despite histologic identity as one entry osteosarcoma, these subtypes are separable based on molecular signatures and specific signaling pathways.

The hallmark of Ewing sarcoma is a translocated fusion transcription factor named EWS::FLI that drives the oncogenic process. We hypothesize that FLI portion of EWS::FLI containing a crucial alpha-helix plays a novel role in transcription regulation of thousands of genes by modulating chromatin looping. The hypothesis is based on recent evidences from our lab: an alpha-helix immediately downstream of DNA binding domain as an important player in regulating transcriptional activity and that EWS::FLI has a substantial role in shaping the chromatin landscape of Ewing sarcoma cells. The <i><u>objective<\/u><\/i> of this study is to elucidate the mechanism underlying transcriptional regulation by FLI. We utilized knockdown\/rescue experiments in which EWS::FLI was depleted with shRNA and replaced with constructs containing the ETS DNA Binding Domain (DBD) alone or DBD+ (DBD and 4<sup>th<\/sup> alpha-helix). The binding pattern and transcriptional regulation were assessed with CUT&#38;Tag and RNA-Seq respectively. The extent of roles each of these construct play in organization, structure, and function of chromatin are being assessed using Micro-C technique, a variation of Hi-C with improved resolution, higher signal-to-noise ratio and more information on chromatin domain boundaries and chromatin looping. The DNA binding and genomic localization of EWS::FLI was unaltered by the deletion surrounding the DNA binding domain (which contains a 4<sup>th<\/sup> alpha-helix) in A673 and TTC466 cells. Despite this similarity in genomic localization and binding, the transcriptional output driven by EWS::FLI was significantly diminished by the deletion. With this current study, we hope to understand if the flanking region neighboring the DNA binding domain contributes to the chromatin architecture remodeling function of EWS::FLI and whether this function could be attributed to the transcriptional output differences in the DBD and DBD+ conditions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ewing sarcoma,EWS-FLI1,Chromatin remodeling,Transcription factor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ariunaa Bayanjargal<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Cenny Taslim<sup><\/sup>, Jesse Crow<sup><\/sup>, Julia Selich-Anderson<sup><\/sup>, Stephen  L.

We believe that the pathognomonic EWS-FLI1 fusion protein (FP) responsible for ES is intimately linked to cell fate, differentiation, and plasticity. Over the last two decades, an emerging body of research has begun the challenging task of deciphering how the FP - via its action as an aberrant transcription factor- blocks differentiation and promotes reprogramming toward a quasi-stem-like cell with features of neuroectodermal or mesenchymal stem cells. We compared ES transcriptome data to other cancers in an unsupervised comparison between the gene expression profile of cancer cells in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and tumor expression datasets. While ES is traditionally classified as a bone cancer, it does not cluster near other bone cancer subtypes (e.g., osteosarcomas) or soft-tissue sarcomas. To that end, we sought to better understand how targeting the FP affected ES differentiation and lineage. Using a CRISPR knockout (CRISPR-KO) model of A673, we targeted Exon 4 of the EWSR1 protein in the n-terminus of the FP and generated a clonal pool (EWSR1 CRISPR KO). We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify the transcriptional changes after FP knockout (FP KO). We identified five cell clusters in the data. We observed the expression of FP target genes (EWS-FLI1 On), <i>PRKCB, <\/i>and <i>LIPI<\/i> and saw robust expression in four of the clusters suggesting normal FP expression. Conversely, FP repressed genes (EWS-FLI1 Off), <i>LOX <\/i>and <i>IGFBP3<\/i>, were elevated in cluster 2, which contained only EWSR1 CRISPR KO cells. This suggests that the FP was successfully knocked out in cluster 2 (FP EWSR1 KO). Next, we asked how the FP KO changed the lineage\/fate of A673 cells. We hypothesized that loss of the FP would induce mesenchymal\/fibroblastic fate in ES cells. To answer this, we used SingleR, which compares the gene expression profile of query cells to the CCLE data set, to identify the nearest cell type. Interestingly, all clusters except the FP EWSR1 KO cluster identified closely with ES and related tumors. The FP EWSR1 KO cluster, which expressed EWS-FLI1 &#8216;off&#8217; genes, did not resemble ES. Using a granular identification with cell lines, we confirmed that the highest score was A673 since these were A673 cell lines. However, the FP EWSR1 KO resulted in a phenotype unrelated to A673 and more closely resembled cell lines with fibroblastic phenotype. Our data suggest that targeting the FP significantly changed ES lineage. While the FP KO did not lead to cell death, our results suggest a novel gene regulatory network acts to sustain ES lineage. Further perturbations in this network may lead to a better understanding of ES treatment, particularly as novel EWS-FLI1-directed therapies emerge.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Single cell,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Fusion proteins,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Danh Truong<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sandhya Krishnan<sup><\/sup>, Alexandar Lazar<sup><\/sup>, David McCall<sup><\/sup>, Joseph  A.

Both local and metastatic ES tumors are characterized by the EWS-FLI1 chromosomal translocation, resulting in an aberrant transcription factor that increases ES cell proliferation and metastasis. EWS-FLI1 activity and ES transformation are reliant upon increased IGF-1 signaling, so initial therapies have centered on IGF-1R inhibition. However, compensatory upregulation of insulin receptor A (<i>IR-A<\/i>), an oncogenic spliced isoform of <i>IR<\/i>, provides a viable resistance mechanism to support ES growth and progression. <i>IR<\/i> has two spliced isoforms formed by the inclusion or exclusion of exon 11 (<i>IR-B<\/i> and <i>IR-A<\/i> respectively), and <i>IR-A<\/i> is differentially expressed in cancers due to its high affinity binding to IGF-II. <i>We hypothesize that the pathogenesis and metastatic potential of ES is driven in part by alternative splicing of IR and other key genes. Furthermore, modulation of this splicing via antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) aided by adeno-associated viral (AAV) delivery may be a novel therapeutic avenue for ES.<\/i><br \/><i>Results:<\/i> We performed long-read mRNA sequencing to identify differentially spliced isoforms between the matched ES cell lines CHLA-9 and CHLA-10 (derived from a localized and metastatic ES tumor respectively). Our analysis revealed global differences in alternative splicing between CHLA-9 and CHLA-10 and identified gene isoforms in the insulin receptor\/IGF signaling pathway (<i>IGFBP3<\/i>) that are unique to CHLA-10. Additionally, we detected both previously reported and novel isoforms for <i>CD99<\/i>, <i>RHOA<\/i>, <i>RACK1<\/i>, splicing factors (<i>PTBP1<\/i>), and eukaryotic initiation factors, among other genes.<br \/>To further understand <i>IR <\/i>alternative splicing, our labs have developed an <i>IR <\/i>ASO targeting the CUG-BP1 regulatory site upstream of exon 11, and we have previously validated its efficacy in HeLa cells transfected with an <i>IR <\/i>minigene and in pediatric sarcoma cell lines. In ES cell lines, we observed significant <i>IR-A<\/i> upregulation in a panel of ES cell lines and patient-derived xenografts derived from local and metastatic tumors, highlighting the opportunity for intervention with our ASO. To facilitate delivery, we have explored the use of AAV vectors, a clinically approved option for gene therapy, and shown successful transduction of AAV-8 over a time-course in ES cells.<br \/><i>Conclusions:<\/i> Our results indicate that alternative splicing is differential between local and metastatic ES and produces isoforms unique to the metastatic setting. Additionally, the oncogenic <i>IR-A<\/i> isoform and other spliced isoforms are viable targets for ASO therapy aided by AAV delivery.

Survival data of 41 patients were available.

PBL-miRNA subtype tumors had characteristic alterations in microRNA-processing genes; <i>DICER1<\/i> mutations (n=14; 4 in Grp1A \/ 1 in Grp1B \/ 9 in Grp2) were most abundant, followed by homozygous deletions of the <i>DROSHA<\/i> locus (n=11; 8 \/ 1 \/ 2) and <i>DROSHA<\/i> mutations (n=9; 3 \/ 3 \/ 3).

Genetic aberrations of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) occur in up to 75% of MPNST cases. PRC2 functions antagonistically to SWI\/SNF protein complexes, regulating expression of target loci in a dynamic relationship that is critical to normal cellular development and maintenance of cell identity. The consequences of PRC2 loss on chromatin state maintained by SWI\/SNF in MPNST is unexplored. Therefore, this study used functional genomics to elucidate the role of SWI\/SNF in MPNST.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>To define the transcriptional regulatory role of SWI\/SNF complexes in MPNST, SWI\/SNF components were targeted via a CRISPR knock-out (KO) screen combined with a single cell RNA sequencing (RNAseq) readout. Genes of interest highlighted by this screen were further investigated using bulk CRISPR RNAseq. Phenotypic effects of the expression of these genes were studied using loss-of-function assays coupled with colony formation assays. SWI\/SNF complex heterogeneity was characterized using glycerol gradient sedimentation, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), and mass spectrometry experiments.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The investigation of SWI\/SNF transcriptional regulation in MPNST highlighted the Double PHD Finger family proteins (DPF1,2,3) as regulating distinct downstream targets. Notably, <i>DPF1 <\/i>had a unique transcriptional profile compared to other SWI\/SNF components. Bulk CRISPR KO RNAseq confirmed these findings and highlighted a specific set of <i>DPF1 <\/i>target<i> <\/i>genes including many long non-coding RNAs. The phenotypic role of DPF1 in MPNST was investigated using <i>in vitro <\/i>siRNA and CRISPR experiments, where DPF1 KO reduced proliferation and viability of MPNST cells in both 2D and 3D cell culture assays. Further, DPF1 was found contribute to anchorage independent cell growth of MPNST cells using soft agar assays. Glycerol gradient sedimentation assays demonstrated that DPF1 co-migrated with core components of a SWI\/SNF complex known as canonical BAF (cBAF) and not the alternate GBAF and PBAF SWI\/SNF complexes. These findings were further validated using co-immunoprecipitation assays where core the SWI\/SNF ATPase, SMARCA4, pulled down DPF1, while components unique to the GBAF and PBAF complexes did not. An ATPase directed proteolysis targeting chimers (PROTAC) was used to therapeutically target cBAF in MPNST cells, reducing their growth and viability. Combination treatment with standard of care chemotherapy synergistically increased the efficacy of this drug.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>DPF1 was identified as a unique transcriptional regulator of MPNST cells and acts as a member of the cBAF SWI\/SNF complex to play important phenotypic roles in this cancer type.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"SWI\/SNF,Epigenetics,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Bega Murray<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Xiyuan Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Shahroze Abbas<sup><\/sup>, Haiyan Lei<sup><\/sup>, Hilda Jafarah<sup><\/sup>, Jack  F.

Recurrent genetic mutations have been linked to its tumorigenesis, including the loss of functional polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). This results in an altered transcription landscape characterized by the global loss of methylation on histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and increased super-enhancer (SE) -associated histone acetylation. We have previously identified SNAI2 as a core SE-driven transcription factor (TF) that is essential for the growth of MPNST. Although <i>SNAI2<\/i> is known to be critical for oncogenic processes, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and dedifferentiation, its role in maintaining MPNST survival through transcriptomic and epigenetic regulation has not been explored.<br \/>Methods: Using CRISPR mediated knockout (KO), we targeted the <i>SNAI2<\/i> DNA binding domain and confirmed KO via western blot, followed by <i>in vitro<\/i> phenotypic characterization, including 2D growth assays, anchorage-independent colony formation assays, and scratch assays. Additionally, an integrative analysis of <i>SNAI2<\/i> genomic distribution and the transcriptomic effect of its KO was performed using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with DNA sequencing (ChIPseq) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq). Finally, an inducible re-expression system was employed to examine the effects on the chromatin landscape with SNAI2 rescue.<br \/>Results: Genetic loss of <i>SNAI2<\/i> slowed the growth of MPNST cells by 50% in comparison to the control. <i>In vitro<\/i> tumorigenic assays revealed that SNAI2 KO diminished the cells&#8217; capacity in invasion but not in anchorage-independent cell growth. Analysis of the RNAseq results revealed that SNAI2 loss upregulated 790 genes and downregulated 1623 genes (log2fold change&#62; 1, p&#60;0.01), indicating a dominant transcriptional activation role. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of these SNAI2-regulated genes revealed upregulation of hallmark Myc targets (normalized enrichment score (NES)=2.6, FDR=0.0), whilst genes involved in response to alpha interferon proteins were downregulated (NES=-1.87, FDR=0.002). Interestingly, genes defining EMT were upregulated (NES=1.6, FDR=0.006) in cells upon SNAI2 loss, contrasting its known repressive role in this biological process in other systems. Through integrative analysis of the RNAseq and ChIPseq data, we demonstrate SNAI2 binding to promoters of its regulated targets. Downstream targets of interest include CRELD1, a gene involved in cell adhesion, where SNAI2 KO caused loss of promoter binding and gene downregulation (p&#60;0.001).<br \/>Conclusion: SNAI2 is an essential SE-driven TF in MPNST cells. Transcriptomic and genomic profiling of SNAI2 through loss- and gain-of-function experiments revealed that it is a critical TF that is involved in key biological processes. Future efforts will focus on designing methods to employ targeted degradation of this essential TF and test preclinical efficacy in treating MPNST.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription factor,Epigenetics ,CRISPR\/Cas9,MPNST,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hilda Jafarah<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Béga Murray<sup><\/sup>, Jack Shern<sup><\/sup>, Xiyuan Zhang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>NIH-NCI, Bethesda, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b75c9f4c-915e-4451-8a54-b03ccee68895","ControlNumber":"4551","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

In one year alone, 4,000 children and young adults will be diagnosed with a brain or central nervous system tumor in the United States. Brain tumors are complex and difficult to treat in growing children, with current treatments oftentimes causing significant and lifelong side effects. Furthermore, there have only been five drugs in the last 20 years approved by the FDA to treat pediatric brain tumors. Founded in 2011, the Children&#8217;s Brain Tumor Network (CBTN) is focused on accelerating the pace of translational research, the discovery of new treatments, and informing precision medicine for children diagnosed with brain tumors. CBTN comprises 32 member institutions\/hospitals having over 4700 patient subjects enrolled, spanning 30+ brain tumor diagnoses, over 66,000 biobanked samples and 150 preclinical models. Longitudinal clinical data is also collected for every subject that is enrolled in the observational protocol.<br \/>Through large scale data generation efforts funded by the NCI and foundational support, CBTN has whole genome, RNA-seq and other molecular characterization for over half of the enrolled patient population. Additionally, efforts have been underway to collect all pathology and radiology imaging and reporting for the subjects. With sequencing being done by multiple vendors, imaging protocols being different across multiple hospitals, and complex clinical treatment and longitudinal follow up data being translated from EHR systems, CBTN has created a rich, but complex, data landscape that is the largest of its kind in the world. In order to accelerate the process of going from data to cures, the data needs to be centralized, organized, and easily distributable. To do this, CBTN has built a first of its kind data workflow that acts as the inventory system for its various data assets. Using a modern data stack including dbt, PostgresSQL, Meltano and AWS, combined with utilization of FHIR as an interchange standard, data from multiple disparate sources such as REDcap, EHR systems, and PAC systems flow in near &#8220;real-time&#8221; to be utilized as integrated data resources.&nbsp;<br \/>The result of this modern, multimodal, and multi-institutional warehouse allows CBTN to distribute data quickly and accurately to translational researchers around the world and contribute data to key research efforts such as AACR Project Genie, Kids First Data Resource Center, NCI Childhood Cancer Data Initiative, and the NCI&#8217;s Open Targets Platform.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Brain tumors,Brain\/central nervous system cancers,Databases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Bailey  K.

To address the urgency, Children&#8217;s Brain Tumor Network (CBTN) has advanced an open science model to accelerate the research discovery for pediatric brain tumors. In first phase of Open Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas (OpenPBTA) effort CBTN together with Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (PNOC) with support of Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource Center (KFDRC) created and comprehensively characterized over 1000 clinically annotated pediatric brain tumors.<br \/>In the second phase of the OpenPBTA effort, through resource awards and collaboration across KFDRC, the NCI Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI), NCI&#8217;s Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), NCI Center for Cancer Research and additional partnered institutions and foundations, CBTN has expanded OpenPBTA to support high throughput molecular characterization for an additional 1900 pediatric brain tumor patients and their families. This includes the processing and characterization of over 8000 specimens across &#62;50 brain tumor diagnoses. The cohort expansion builds on &#62;1000 previously characterized samples with a portfolio of multimodal data including whole genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, miRNA sequencing, methylation sequencing, proteomics, lipidomics and\/or metabolomics. Molecular data is linked to patient longitudinal clinical data, imaging data (MRIs and radiology reports), histology slide images, and pathology reports. To inform novel discovery and clinical implementation of genomic approaches for diagnostic\/therapeutic purposes, the data is deposited the cloud-based research environment of the NCI&#8217;s CCDI and the KFDRC to provide near real-time integration, dissemination, processing, and sharing of associated petabyte-scale harmonized data. The approach leverages the DRC platform&#8217;s cloud-based computational environment in CAVATICA. Processed annotations are facilitated via CAVATICA-enabled shareable pipelines and can be explored through PedcBioPortal, a data visualization\/analysis application further integrating additional public and deposited datasets. This expansion phase of OpenPBTA is released with no embargo period and provides one of the largest deeply characterized cohorts of pediatric brain tumor samples and associated clinical data for &#62;3000 pediatric brain tumor patients. CBTN&#8217;s open-science, rapid-release model aims to advance novel biomarkers and therapeutic exploratory research, supporting new clinical trial development and accelerated discovery on behalf of changing the outcome for kids with brain tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Brain tumors,Genomics,Multiomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mateusz  P.

MB is located in the cerebellum in the brain and can spread to the spine or to other parts of brain. Because MB growth is very fast, MB is categorized as a type of high-grade malignant primary tumors. MB development is often associated with the dysregulation of signaling pathways, such as the wingless (WNT) and sonic hedgehog (SHH). Methylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) is a major methylation mark. Trimethyl H3K4 (H3K4me3) occupies as much as 75% of all human gene promoters. We previously reported that the H3K4 methyltransferase KMT2D (also called MLL4, MLL2, and ALR; a transcriptional coactivator, is required for neuronal differentiation of human neuron-lineage NT2\/D1 stem cells. Interestingly, our analysis of several databases has shown that <i>Kmt2d<\/i><b> <\/b>is the most frequently mutated epigenetic modifier (8%&#8210;10%) in medulloblastoma (MB). Recently, we showed that brain-specific knockout of <i>Kmt2d <\/i>alone induces spontaneous MB in mice. <i>Kmt2d<\/i> loss highly upregulated several oncogenic signaling programs and downregulated tumor suppressive genes. In this study, we sought to determine whether <i>Kmt2d <\/i>loss cooperates with another oncogenic event in MB genesis. Particularly, <i>PTCH<\/i> (also known as <i>PTCH1<\/i>) is one of the most frequently mutated genes in MB, and <i>KMT2D<\/i> is known to be a shared driver gene mutation in MB. For these reasons, we examined the effect of <i>Kmt2d<\/i> loss on of <i>Ptch<sup>+\/-<\/sup><\/i>-driven MB genesis. A heterozygous loss of <i>Kmt2d<\/i> increased the incidence and progression of <i>Ptch<\/i><sup>+\/-<\/sup>-driven MB genesis. We have shown that <i>Kmt2d<\/i> loss reduces epigenomic signals for super-enhancers\/enhancers and broad H3K4me3 in 4-month-old cerebella. In addition, we determine the effect of heterozygous Kmt2d loss on cell proliferation by comparing the Nes-Cre Kmt2d<sup>fl\/+<\/sup> Ptch<sup>+\/- <\/sup>(KP) cerebella to Ptch<sup>+\/- <\/sup>cerebella at 2- &#38; 4-month-old time points using IHC staining of Ki-67 (a proliferation marker). MB&#8217;s from KP mice showed two different mechanisms by activating oncogenic cellular signaling kinases (e.g., phospho [p]-AKT and p-p38) levels as well as MYCN signaling pathway. Our transcriptomic analysis revealed several tumor suppressive and transcriptional corepressor genes to be downregulated such as<i> Ncor2<\/i> and <i>Dnmt3a<\/i>. We found<i> Ncor2<\/i> depletion in Ptch-\/+ neurospheres shows upregulation of similar oncogenic genes as in KP mice tumors. <i>Kmt2d<\/i> loss reduced cerebellar granule cell differentiation. Our analysis for oncogenic kinases may provide a basis for a novel MB treatment plan involving the use of cellular kinase inhibitors. As KMT2D is among the most often mutated genes in human MBs, this mouse model may be useful for future preclinical therapeutic experiments for the treatment of MB patients. KMT2D in medulloblastoma genesis using mouse models will provide epigenetic and mechanistic insights into how heterozygous KMT2D loss promotes medulloblastoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-03 Pediatric cancer models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Tumor suppressor gene,Medulloblastoma,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shilpa S.

Children diagnosed with high-grade gliomas have poor prognosis, and there remains a need for improvement in the standard of care. In order to improve the standard of care for this condition, it is necessary to develop<i> in vitro<\/i> models which better recapitulate the nature of the tumors. Three-dimensional bioprinting has proven to be an effective technique in creating microtumors using adult glioblastoma cell lines but remains unexplored in pediatric glioblastoma. As such, we sought to develop a protocol which would allow for the creation of three-dimensionally bioprinted microtumors using patient-derived pediatric glioblastoma cells.<br \/>Methods:A Bio X three-dimensional bioprinter (Cellink) was utilized to create the microtumor constructs. The composition of the bioink was modified through varying concentrations of sodium alginate and gelatin, or gelatin-methacrylate (Gel-MA). The microtumor size and volume was optimized through the variation of extrusion time, nozzle pressure, and both nozzle and print bed temperature. The crosslinking technique was also optimized through the utilization of 2% calcium chloride for varying exposure times, and also a 405-nm light (for Gel-MA bioink) at varied light intensity, length of time of application to, and distance from, the printed structure. Bioprinted pediatric XD456 brain tumor initiating cell constructs were treated with both chemotherapeutics and radiation to determine the model&#8217;s capacity to respond to treatment. PamStation 12 (PamGene Inc.) Kinomic data and RNA-seq (Illumina) data were generated for the constructs. Imaging was performed using Cytation 5 imager (Agilent).<br \/>Results:Fluorescent microscopy with Calcein AM and Sytox&#8482; Orange (ThermoFisher), along with viability assessments via CellTiter-Glo&#174;, demonstrated expected cytotoxic effects after exposure to 10 &#956;M Cisplatin. Additionally, PamStation 12 Kinomic and RNA-seq data indicated a difference in kinomic signaling between the bioprinted constructs as compared to the XD456 cells cultured as neurospheres.<br \/>Conclusions:The utilization of a three-dimensional bioprinter allows for the creation of microtumors using patient-derived pediatric glioblastoma cells. Future studies will investigate the microtumors&#8217; capacity as a drug screening model. The model will also be developed to further recapitulate the native tumor microenvironment of pediatric glioblastoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-03 Pediatric cancer models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Pediatric cancers,Modeling,Glioma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Andee  M.

Among the known subtypes of MB, <i>GLI2<\/i>-amplified SHH-MB associated with P53 mutations has the worst prognosis, and a 5-year survival rate of less than 30%. Moreover, <i>GLI2<\/i>-amplified MBs are non-responsive to SMO inhibitors, the only targeted treatment option available for SHH-MB. To address this treatment gap, there is an urgent need to identify novel potential therapeutic targets, an effort that requires better understanding of key cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying <i>GLI2<\/i>-amplified MB.

The O-PDXs have undergone comprehensive characterization including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, histologic review and analysis of cellular heterogeneity. All data, tissue samples and cryopreserved O-PDXs are freely available with no obligation to collaborate through the Childhood Solid Tumor Network (CSTN) at www.stjude.org\/CSTN\/. While these in vivo models are useful for preclinical testing of drugs and immunotherapy, researchers are limited by throughput, expense and expertise. High throughput ex vivo culture systems that more faithfully recapitulate the cellular heterogeneity and arrested differentiation in the patient tumors are urgently needed to test new drug combinations. Solid tumor cell lines have undergone extensive selection and adaptation in culture, and most have lost the cellular heterogeneity found in patient tumors. In order to overcome this barrier in the field, we have developed a 3D-to-2D workflow. Previous attempts to produce 2D ex vivo cultures from patient tumors or O-PDXs have had limited success because most cells die upon initial plating, they are difficult to cryopreserve for future studies and they lose key cell populations found in the patient tumors. Our new workflow was designed to overcome two sources of stress when adapting patient tumors or O-PDXs to culture. The first source of stress is transitioning from the in vivo environment to ex vivo in culture medium. The second source of stress is the transition from extensive 3D cell-cell contacts in vivo to a more limited cell-cell contact ex vivo. To overcome these two sources of stress, we adapted cultures to 2D in a stepwise manner. First, we dissociate O-PDX tumors into single cell suspension and then rapidly re-aggregate them in 3D spheres for ex vivo culture. After the spheres have grown for 7 days, they are transitioned to 2D by seeding cells in culture dishes coated with extracellular matrix components. Importantly, the 3D and 2D cultures preserve the cellular heterogeneity of the O-PDX and patient tumor and they can be cryopreserved. When injected back into immunocompromised mice, they recapitulate the molecular and cellular features of the original tumors. We have shown that the 3D and 2D cultures can be genetically manipulated using lentiviral vectors and can be used for high-throughput drug screening. Matched 3D and 2D cryovials are now available to the international biomedical research community for rhabdomyosarcoma through the CSTN. Neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma and retinoblastoma are expected to be available in late 2023.

Pediatric tumors exhibit a high intertumoral heterogeneity, as different tumor types and subtypes have emerged with peculiar molecular and clinical features; however, compared to cancer in adults, pediatric tumors are rare and mostly present with lower mutational burden. The lack of specific therapeutic options represents the main current challenge; systematic, multi-disciplinary approaches are required to accelerate drug development and ultimately to find cures for all children with cancer. The EU funded &#8220;Innovative Therapies for Children with Cancer--Pediatric Preclinical Proof-of-Concept Project&#8221; (ITCC-P4; <u>www.itccp4.eu<\/u><u><\/u>) consortium consists of a public-private partnership including academic and industrial partners with the goal of developing a large-scale platform comprising &#62;400 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models representing high-risk pediatric cancers. Currently, this collection of PDX models includes the most common types of pediatric tumors, such as leukemia (n=28), bone and soft-tissue sarcomas (n=154), CNS tumors (n=96) and neuroblastomas (n=38), as well as other rare childhood cancers, such as hepatoblastomas (n=20) and malignant rhabdoid tumors (n=18); PDX models have been generated either from primary (n=206) or relapse (n=118) disease. In order to: a) investigate the biology of the pediatric PDX models in a high-throughput and systematic fashion, b) assess whether they accurately reflect the molecular features of the corresponding primary tumor and, c) identify potential new suitable biomarkers, we performed a comprehensive molecular characterization (whole-exome and low-coverage whole-genome sequencing; DNA methylation profiling; RNAseq and gene expression profiling) of the PDX models, as well as their matching human tumors and germline samples. These data contributed to the stratification of the PDX models based on their mutational status and emerging molecular vulnerabilities to inform <i>in vivo <\/i>drug testing in all these PDX models. This proof-of-concept drug testing has been conducted defining, for each group of models, a panel of single compounds (SOC n=3; novel targeted therapies, n=6) or combinations (with each other or with chemo- or radiotherapy).

Current therapies are effective but can cause long-term health problems for patients. Development of new therapies relies on faithful preclinical models. Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) are an important tool for pre-clinical testing in childhood cancer research. It remains incompletely understood how well genomically PDXs recapitulate primary patient tumors (PTs), particularly in rare cancers.<br \/>Method: To characterize the fidelity of early passage subcutaneous PDXs derived from pediatric solid tumors, we established 70 early passage PDX models from 16 cancer types. The cohort comprises some very rare cancers such as hepatoblastoma (n=13), germ cell tumor (n=10), osteosarcoma (n=13), and Wilms tumor (n=14). We performed low pass whole genome, exome, and RNA sequencing on these PDXs, their matched PTs and germline samples when materials were available.<br \/>Result: Overall, we observed low somatic mutation rates in these tumors; however, prior chemotherapy was associated with higher mutation rate. Of the 25 PT\/PDX pairs, 20 showed high mutation similarity. The five pairs with low mutation similarity showed evidence of clonal selection. We observed high genomic instability in osteosarcoma. Consistently, more fusions were identified in this cancer type. PTs and PDXs showed high similarity in the copy number pattern, including both broad and focal events. GISTIC analysis identified recurrently amplified or deleted genes including <i>MYC<\/i>, <i>CCNE1<\/i>, <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>PTEN<\/i>, and <i>BCL2<\/i>. On the transcriptional level, though PTs and PDXs were generally similar, their expression is more reflective of tissue of origin. We identified fusions that are characteristic of the cancer type such as <i>BCOR-CCND3<\/i> in an Ewing like sarcoma. We also identified an NTRK fusion in an osteosarcoma. In summary, we show that PDXs generally recapitulate PTs in mutations, copy number changes, and expression. The dataset represents a valuable resource for future preclinical and mechanistic studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,cancer evolution,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Funan He<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Abhik  M.
