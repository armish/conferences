[{"Abstract":"Introduction: Treatment modality selection for metastatic NSCLC patients (immunotherapy alone vs. combination of immunotherapy with chemotherapy) relies mainly on determining the programmed cell death 1 (PD-L1) expression levels in the tumor. However, available assays are only moderately predictive. Here we set to develop PROphet&#174;, a plasma proteomics-based predictive model for informing treatment decisions for NSCLC patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based therapy.<br \/>Methods: Pre-ICI plasma samples were collected in 12 centers in a clinical trial (NCT04056247) from 367 advanced-stage NSCLC patients. Clinical benefit (CB) was assessed at 12 months based on the occurrence of progression-free survival (PFS) until this time point. Deep proteomic profiling of the plasma samples was performed using aptamer-based technology. A novel machine learning model was developed to determine the CB probability for each patient, and the performance was successfully evaluated on an independent validation set, followed by training and prediction over the entire cohort using cross-validation. The resulting PROphet&#174; score (positive or negative) was determined by setting the median CB rate probability as a threshold. The patients were divided into four subgroups based on their PD-L1 expression level combined with their PROphet&#174; score prediction, and the overall survival (OS) was examined for each subgroup.<br \/>Results: The PROphet&#174; computational model was evaluated in a blinded manner on a subset of 85 patients and displayed strong predictive capability with area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) plot of 0.78 (p-value = 5.00e-05), outperforming a PD-L1-based predictive model (AUC = 0.62; p-value 2.76e-01). When combining PROphet&#174; score with PD-L1 expression levels, four different outcome patterns were identified: (i) Patients with PD-L1 &#8805;50% and PROphet&#174; negative score, who displayed significantly longer OS when treated with ICI-chemotherapy combination therapy compared to ICI monotherapy and may consider combination therapy. (ii) Patients with PD-L1 &#8805;50% and PROphet&#174; positive score, who benefit similarly from either treatment modalities, and may consider monotherapy to avoid the potential toxicity of the combination therapy. (iii) Patients with PD-L1&#60;50% and PROphet&#174; negative score, who do not benefit from either treatment modalities and may consider chemotherapy alone or treatment beyond standard of care. (iv) Patients with PD-L1&#60;50% and PROphet&#174; positive score who benefit from combination therapy.<br \/>Conclusions: Altogether, the PROphet&#174; model, when combined with PD-L1 test, stratifies the patients into four subgroups, providing additional resolution to the PD-L1 biomarker currently used to guide treatment selection. Furthermore, the model accurately predicts CB at 12 months based on proteomic analysis of a pre-treatment plasma sample.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Proteomics,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Michal Harel<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Petros Christopoulos<sup>2<\/sup>, Coren Lahav<sup>1<\/sup>, Itamar Sela<sup>1<\/sup>, Nili Dahan<sup>1<\/sup>, Niels Reinmuth<sup>3<\/sup>, Ina Koch<sup>3<\/sup>, Alona Zer<sup>4<\/sup>, Mor Moskovitz<sup>5<\/sup>, Adva Levy-Barda<sup>6<\/sup>, Michal Lotem<sup>7<\/sup>, Hovav Nechushtan<sup>7<\/sup>, Rivka Katzenelson<sup>8<\/sup>, Abed Agbarya<sup>9<\/sup>, Mahmoud Abu-Amna<sup>10<\/sup>, Maya Gottfried<sup>11<\/sup>, Ido Wolf<sup>12<\/sup>, Ella Tepper<sup>13<\/sup>, Yanyan Lou<sup>14<\/sup>, Raya Leibowitz<sup>15<\/sup>, Adam P.

Chemotherapy involves the use of anti-tubulins (docetaxel, cabazitaxel), platinum salts, and topoisomerase inhibitors (TOPO1, TOPO2A). There is no biomarker of chemotherapy that is routinely used. We examined 87 prostate cancer samples using targeted proteomics for biomarkers of response or resistance to chemotherapy agents. Biomarkers of resistance include ERCC1 (Platinum), TUBB3 (taxanes), ALDH1A1 (cyclophosphamide), while response biomarkers include TOPO1 (irinotecan, topotecan), TOPO2A (doxorubicin, epirubicin), and hENT1 (Gemcitabine). We also measured markers for several antibody-drug conjugates targets (Her2, Her3, Trop2) in our clinical proteomics (CLIA) platform and several ADC\/ CAR-T proteins (PSMA, STEAP1, Nectin4, Claudin 18.2. in our research platform<br \/>Methods: Tumor areas from Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues from clinical samples of prostate cancer received at our CLIA certified laboratory were microdissected and a quantitative proteomic analysis of 72 biomarkers were conducted using selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (SRM-MS).<br \/>Discussion:[WL1] Androgen receptor was detected in majority of the samples (83%) with a 19x range of distribution (329 amol\/ug - 24063 amol\/&#181;g). Majority of prostate cancer samples expressed a range of resistance markers for anti-tubulin inhibitors (TUBB3: 69% detection with a 14x range) indicating that the high expressors is likely to be resistant to docetaxel\/ cabazitaxel based regimens. ERCC1, a marker for resistance to platinum-based agents, was not detected in 26% of cases, potentially enabling a cisplatin\/carboplatin-based regimen in 1\/4<sup>th<\/sup> of prostate cancer patients. Cyclophosphamide could be effective in 10% of cases where ALDH1A1 was not detected. TOPO1, a marker for irinotecan-based therapy was observed in 94% of cases with a range of ~6x (488 - 2760 amol\/&#181;g). Other chemotherapy agents that are not routinely used in prostate cancer was observed in select groups. These include doxorubicin biomarker TOPO2A in 34% of cases with 10x range, gemcitabine biomarker hENT1 in 36% of cases (4x range), temozolomide biomarker MGMT (ND in 12% of cases). ADC biomarker analysis revealed HER2 which was observed in 59% of the cases with range of expression from 301 - 1255 amol\/&#181;g including a significant population of low HER2 (84%, &#60;750 amol\/&#181;g) cases among the detected samples. HER3 was detected in 33% of cases with a 3x range (178 - 580 amol\/&#181;g). EGFR was detected in 94% of samples at levels ranging from 131-1125 amol\/&#181;g. Trop2 was quantitated in 93% of the cases and had wide range of 37x (437 -16267 amol\/ &#181;g). The capacity to multiplex 72 protein biomarkers from 2-3 FFPE sections yields a wealth of actionable information for clinical treatment or patient stratification in clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Chemotherapy,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sheeno P.

Standard first-line treatment for late-stage inoperable NSCLC still is chemotherapy regiments. However, most NSCLC patients fail to respond to these regimens or relapse upon treatment. Thus, there is a pressing need to identify novel therapeutic targets that can more effectively treat NSCLC. Quinolinic acid phosphoribosyl transferase (QPRT) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the tryptophan catabolic pathway which fuels <i>de novo<\/i> NAD+ production, whose expression as previously been shown to have a prognostic value in certain cancers. Here, we demonstrate that high QPRT levels is a feature of a large proportion of NSCLC cell lines and that QPRT induction occurs in genetically engineered models of NSCLC (KP and KL) when compared to the normal lung. Considering the critical role of NAD+ levels to enable high rates of proliferation, we hypothesized that QPRT induction enables lung cancer cells to thrive. Strikingly, QPRT knockdown in a panoply of NSCLC cell lines results in pronounced suppression of tumor cells both in 2D and 3D conditions. Interestingly, we observe that QPRT suppression does not affect proliferation or cell cycle progression but rather due to pronounced induction of cell death. Surprisingly, while we observed DNA damage upon QPRT suppression, NAD+ levels were not affected by QPRT suppression indicating that QPRT&#8217;s effects in NSCLC are independent of its contribution to the NAD+ pools. Together, our results point for QPRT as a novel and effective therapeutic target for NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer metabolism,NSCLC,Signaling ,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hossein Kashfi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nathan Ward<sup>2<\/sup>, Didem Ilter<sup>1<\/sup>, Stanislav Drapela<sup>1<\/sup>, Aimee Falzone<sup>2<\/sup>, Stephen Gardell<sup>3<\/sup>, Gina M.

Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive adult brain cancer, with a 5-year survival of less than 15%. Treatment decisions are guided by imaging, which at early timepoints cannot distinguish tumor pseudoprogression from non-response. Our work seeks to identify circulating biomarkers that can classify response as an alternative or adjunct to imaging. Here we present preliminary data exploring the potential of circulating cytokines and tumor cells collected before, during, and after treatment with the goal to identify potential makers for treatment adaptation.<br \/>Methods. After consent, patient blood was collected the week before initiating chemoradiotherapy, weekly during treatment, and three weeks after treatment. Serum was tested by multiplex bead-based immunoassay (Legendplex Human Inflammation Panel 1, Biolegend inc.) targeting 13 cytokines and ELISA targeting soluble Human GFAP (Glial fibrillary acidic protein) (Biovendor R&#38;D). The Circulogix filtration system was also used to capture cells of size consistent with circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Initial efforts focused on cells co-staining for GFAP and Olig2 and negative for CD45 (hematopoietic marker). All patient tumor specimens and cell lines were verified for GFAP and Olig2 expression by IHC. We selected 13 patients for the current analysis: 5 with growth due to non-response (NR), 6 stable disease (S) and two pseudo progression (PP). These classifications were evaluated radiologically at the first follow up after chemoradiotherapy (S or no) and based on whether changes observed stabilized or resolved spontaneously within six months or continued to progress (NR or PP).<br \/>Results. The immunoassays detected approximately 70% of the analytes in our samples. Among those, IL10 and IL33 were higher before treatment on patients later determined to have stable disease (IL10 p=0.09; IL33 p=0.043 KW test; IL10 median S=22.93 ng\/mL, NR=13.415ng\/mL; IL33 median S= 164.10ng\/mL, NR=55.57ng\/mL). Interestingly, IL33 is reduced on stable patients during week 5 of treatment (PRE vs. W5 p=0.033; median PRE=164.1ng\/mL, W5=57.57ng\/mL). GFAP presented a slightly lower level after treatment in stable patients (S vs. NR p=0.014; median S=0.441 ng\/ml, NR=0.473 ng\/ml). As proof of concept, 50 GBM cells from each of U87 adherent cells, or 0913 and 0821 neurosphere cells (CD45 negative) glioblastoma cell lines were mixed in separate vials with 106 hematopoietic cells (RAJI; CD45 positive) and filtered per the procedure to identify CTCs in patient blood. We separated GBM cells from hematopoietic cells on the filtration system.<br \/>Conclusion. Our preliminary data suggest that blood obtained during chemoradiotherapy can identify biomarkers associated with response. For example, IL10, IL33, GFAP, and CTCs might be used to classify treatment response at very early timepoints. We continue to recruit additional patients for additional analyses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Biomarkers,Imaging,Therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Paulo Roberto Del Valle<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jonathan  B.

Following curative-intent first-line therapies, clinical surveillance involves serial CT imaging. However, such surveillance can detect only macroscopic disease recurrence and is frequently inconclusive. NGS has been utilized to help identify and monitor treatment plans. Nucleosomes, complexes of DNA and histones proteins, are released during cell death into blood circulation. Trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27Me3), catalyzed by enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), is a crucial epigenetic process in tumorigenesis. We investigated if H3K27Me3-nucleosome concentration could be a biomarker for molecular residual disease (MRD).<br \/>Patients and Methods: Plasmas were retrospectively collected from patients with advanced LC during treatment (CIRCAN&#8217;s cohort, n= 200) and from healthy donors (n=100). We carried out standard targeted NGS on paired plasmas. Samples were divided in two sub-groups based on genetical results: ctDNA negative (n=120) or positive (n=80) for presence of somatic alterations. Concentration of circulating H3K27Me3-nucleosome was measured using chemiluminescent Nu.Q&#174; immunoassay (Belgian Volition SRL, Belgium).<br \/>Results: Significantly elevated concentrations of H3K27Me3-nucleosomes were found in LC plasmas during the follow-up of patients compared to healthy donors (median 14.9 ng\/ml vs 6.15 ng\/ml, respectively, p&#60;0.001). In addition, H3K27Me3 levels is lower in the ctDNA-negative group compared to ctDNA-positive group (median 12.1 vs 24.8 ng\/ml, respectively, p&#60;0.001). At a clinical cut-off of 14 ng\/ml, 62% of samples were positive for either H3K27Me3 or ctDNA, or for both, suggesting an active disease progression compared to only 40% detection using the NGS assay alone. 38% of the patients have low levels of H3K27Me3 and were ctDNA-negative strongly suggesting a therapeutic response under treatment.<br \/>Conclusions: High levels of Nu.Q&#174; H3K27Me3 could allow physicians to detect MRD in LC patients following treatment with curative intent. This could be achieved by monitoring testing of patients at defined intervals of treatment and recovery, alongside imaging, to incorporate analyses of evolving molecular landscapes during treatment. In this setting, the H3K27Me3-nucleosome quantification, to complete the molecular exploration of cfDNA is highly encouraging, especially in advanced NSCLC, where re-tissue biopsies are impractical, expensive, and may cause undue harm. H3K27Me3-nucleosome quantification may also be useful in patient identification for specific treatments such as EZH2 inhibitor, but this requires investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Nucleosome,Trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27Me3),Molecular Residual Disease (MRD) ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Emmanuel Grolleau<sup>1<\/sup>, Julie Candiracci<sup>2<\/sup>, Arnaud Gauthier<sup>1<\/sup>, Gaelle Lescuyer<sup>1<\/sup>, David Barthelemy<sup>1<\/sup>, Christine Haon<sup>1<\/sup>, Florence Geiguer<sup>1<\/sup>, Margaux Raffin<sup>1<\/sup>, Nathalie Hardat<sup>2<\/sup>, Julie Balandier<sup>1<\/sup>, Rémi Rabeuf<sup>2<\/sup>, Anne-Sophie Wozny<sup>1<\/sup>, Guillaume Rommelaere<sup>2<\/sup>, Claire Rodriguez-Lafrasse<sup>1<\/sup>, Fabien Subtil<sup>1<\/sup>, Sébastien Couraud<sup>1<\/sup>, Marielle Herzog<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Lea Payen-Gay<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud - HCL, Pierre Benite, France,<sup>2<\/sup>Belgian Volition, SRL, Isnes, Belgium","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2f179385-e66d-48a7-9a86-380a7e7688c0","ControlNumber":"2591","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>E.

It constitutes a well-established therapeutic target for various small molecules. ER immunohistochemistry is used in surgical pathology for the distinction of tumors of the breast and gynecological organs. To comprehensively determine ER expression in normal and neoplastic tissues, a tissue microarray containing 18,560 samples from 149 different tumor types and subtypes as well as 608 samples of 76 different normal tissue types was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. ER positivity was found in 55 of 149 tumor categories, and 27 of these tumor categories contained at least one case with strong ER staining. ER positivity was most seen in various subtypes of breast cancer (78.9-95.7%) and in several different tumor categories of the ovary and the endometrium (8.5-75.9%). Other commonly ER positive tumor entities included leiomyoma (65.9%), neuroendocrine tumor of the appendix (43.8%), leiomyosarcoma (22.9%), Sertoli Leydig cell tumor of the ovary (1 of 3 positive), rhabdomyosarcoma (16.7%), angiomyolipoma (10%), colorectal neuroendocrine carcinoma (9.1%), myoepithelial carcinoma of the salivary gland (8.3%), granulosa cell tumor of the ovary (8.3%), epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma of the salivary gland (7.7%), squamous cell carcinomas of various sites of origin (0.8-6.7%), testicular teratoma (5.3%), Brenner tumor of the ovary (5.1%), Ewing sarcoma (5%), adenocarcinoma NOS of the salivary gland (4.8%), papillary thyroid carcinoma (3.3%), sarcoma, not otherwise specified (NOS) (2.8%), paraganglioma (2.6%), non-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma, pTa G3 (2.4%), pulmonary adenocarcinoma (2.1%), neuroendocrine tumor of the ileum (2.1%), and adenocarcinoma of the prostate, Gleason 5+5 (1.2%). Among 1,411 evaluable invasive breast carcinomas of no special type (NST), absent or low ER immunostaining was significantly linked to high BRE grade (p&#60;0.0001), advanced pT stage (p&#60;0.0001), distant metastasis (p=0.0012), HER2 overexpression and reduced progesterone receptor expression (p&#60;0.0001 each) but not to nodal metastasis and patient survival. Among 378 high grade serous ovarian cancer, low ER immunostaining was linked to nodal metastasis (p=0.0112). Our data provide a comprehensive overview on the pattern of ER expression in cancer. The data show that ER expression predominated in gynecological and breast tumors. However, occasional (strong) ER expression can also occur in a broad variety of non-breast and non-gynecological neoplasms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Estrogen receptor,Tissue microarrays,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Florian Viehweger<sup>1<\/sup>, David Dum<sup>1<\/sup>, Anne Menz<sup>1<\/sup>, Ria Uhlig<sup>1<\/sup>, Andrea Hinsch<sup>1<\/sup>, Doris Hoeflmayer<sup>1<\/sup>, Christoph Fraune<sup>1<\/sup>, Christian Bernreuther<sup>1<\/sup>, Patrick Lebok<sup>1<\/sup>, Soeren Weidemann<sup>1<\/sup>, Guido Sauter<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Maximilian Lennartz<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Frank Jacobsen<sup>1<\/sup>, Till Sebastian Clauditz<sup>1<\/sup>, Till Krech<sup>1<\/sup>, Andreas H Marx<sup>2<\/sup>, Ronald Simon<sup>1<\/sup>, Stefan Steurer<sup>1<\/sup>, Sarah Minner<sup>1<\/sup>, Eike Burandt<sup>1<\/sup>, Natalia Gorbokon<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany,<sup>2<\/sup>Academic Hospital Fuerth, Fuerth, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bf4edc88-9630-4676-b90d-46f56b11057d","ControlNumber":"7187","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

Pathologic complete response (pCR) at the time of cystectomy predicts better survival. Unfortunately, only approximately a third of patients achieve such a response. The aim of this study is to explore in the tumor microenvironment and in the peripheral blood, biomarkers associated with pCR following NAC and to further evaluate the pharmacodynamic modifications induced by NAC on immune cells detected in the peripheral blood.<br \/>Methods: N= 13 patients with MIBC received NAC and were classified as pCR (n=8) or no-pCR (n=5). Bulk RNA-seq was performed on the 13-patients formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor biopsies collected prior to NAC treatment (baseline). Lymphocytes and neutrophils counts were assessed in the peripheral blood at baseline and following treatment with NAC. Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox PH regression models were used for survival analyses (OS). Inter- and intra-tumor immune heterogeneity of n=59 selected immune protein was determined using GeoMx DigitalSpatial Profiling (DSP) technology.<br \/>Results: Bulk RNAseq revealed 1119 transcripts differentially expressed between pCR and no-pCR (p &#8804; 0.01; Abs linear Fold Change &#62;2). Particularly, we observed an increased expression of genes involved in B cell function (<i>CD19<\/i>, <i>CLEC4D<\/i>, <i>CXCR5<\/i>), dendritic cell activation (<i>XCR1<\/i>, <i>CCL5<\/i>) and formation of tertiary lymphoid structure in the TME of pCR vs. no-pCR. On the contrary, an increased expression of IL8, DNA repair genes (<i>POLB<\/i>, <i>DMC1<\/i>, <i>RPA4<\/i>, <i>HFM1<\/i>, <i>RAD54B<\/i>) and genes involved in cell adhesion was observed at baseline in the TME of no-pCR. Interestingly, patients with higher expression of <i>CXCR5 <\/i>and <i>XCR1 <\/i>and lower expression of <i>POLB <\/i>at baseline (medium expression as cut off) were also characterized by longer overall survival following cystectomy. DSP confirmed a TLS enrichment (CD20<sup>+<\/sup>, HLA-DR<sup>+<\/sup>) in the TME of pCR prior treatment initiation. On the contrary, an increased infiltration of Tregs (CD25<sup>+<\/sup>, CD127<sup>+<\/sup>) and immunosuppressive cells (CD45<sup>+<\/sup>, ARG<sup>+<\/sup>) was detected at baseline in no-pCR. Interestingly, also an increased expression of immune checkpoints such as PD-L1, VISTA, ICOS and LAG3, was observed at baseline in the TME of no-pCR. While no clear association with NAC response was seen for lymphocytes and neutrophils counts when evaluated in baseline peripheral blood, a significant increase of lymphocytes and decrease of neutrophils counts, respectively, was observed in pCR vs no-pCR following NAC.<br \/>Conclusions:<b> <\/b>When confirmed on a larger cohort, our results will lead to novel therapeutic strategies and to novel biomarkers predicting patients likely to respond to NAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Prognostic markers,Tumor microenvironment,Cisplatin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maria  L.

Patients were categorized as untreated, primary treatment, remission, and secondary treatment based on when their serum sample was collected. Primary treatment indicated current treatment with first-line medical therapy, remission indicated those without evidence of disease after prostatectomy or first-line medical therapy, and secondary therapy indicated second-line treatment currently being given due to treatment-resistant disease. Other variables collected include age, race, ethnicity, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measured at the time of diagnosis, PSA measured at the time of serum sample collection, Gleason score, and clinical stage using the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system. Finally, VEGF-C levels in patient serum were measured using a commercially available ELISA assay (R&#38;D System, Minneapolis, MN). The final data was analyzed using a linear regression model to compare VEGF-C levels between treatment groups, as well as VEGF-C level correlation with each of the other variables collected. Results: All patients were male with an age range of 47 to 85 years, with a mean age of 65.3 years. Most were white (n=135) and non-Hispanic (n=148). VEGF-C levels ranged from 341 pg\/ml to 15,983 pg\/ml, with a mean of 3,787 pg\/ml. Of the 155 patients, 8 were untreated, 26 were in primary therapy, 66 were in remission, and 52 were in secondary therapy. Results showed no statistically significant correlation between VEGF-C levels and PSA at diagnosis, PSA at serum collection, Gleason score, or clinical stage. The most interesting difference between treatment groups was a higher VEGF-C level in remission (mean 63.48 pg\/ml) versus secondary therapy (mean 55.31 pg\/ml), although this was not statistically significant (p=0.089). Conclusions: Our results indicated that plasma VEGF-C alone is not a prognostic indicator for prostate cancer. Since our studies using cell culture and animal models of prostate cancer have indicated the role of VEGF-C and the NRP2 axis in promoting metastasis and therapy resistance in prostate cancer, it would be useful to determine both the VEGF-C and NRP2 levels in the plasma of the same patients and study whether their level together would predict the outcome of medical therapy. Our ongoing experiments to determine plasma NRP2 levels in this patient cohort should be able to test this hypothesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),Neuropilins,Biomarkers,Therapy resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sarah  A.

NAD(P)H: Quinone Oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is an enzyme that contributes to chemoprotection for CRC. The aim of this meta-analysis is to test the connection between NQO1 C609T polymorphisms and CRC risk. Furthermore, the study explores the binding capacity and efficacy of BBI 608 against NQO1 in CRC through molecular docking. The inhibitor will then be tested<i> in vitro<\/i>.<br \/>Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were used in bibliographic searches. For the NQO1 C609T analysis, a total of 18 studies were used. Data was gathered and subsequently calculated using the pooled odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval, CI). Molecular docking, Western Blot and QRT-PCR were used to determine the molecular function of BBI 608 and NQO1.<br \/>Results: The relation between NQO1 polymorphism and CRC risk (TT + CT vs. CC: OR=1.19, 95% CI =1.06-1.34, p&#60;0.001) was significant. Furthermore, stratified investigation based on ethnicity indicated significant association between NQO1 polymorphism and CRC risk (TT + CT vs. CC: OR=1.17, 95% CI =1.08-1.27, p&#60;0.001). This study indicates that the C609T polymorphism of NQO1 is linked with CRC risk in Asians and Caucasians. To observe the molecular properties of BBI 608 (NQO1 inhibitor) and to analyze the exact mechanism of NQO1 on CRC, computational approaches were applied. This investigation provides a detailed understanding of the interaction between NQO1 and BBI 608 and its implication in CRC therapy. To support this computational analysis, <i>in vitro<\/i> studies were performed. BBI 608 creates higher cytotoxicity in a dose dependent manner in CRC cell lines. BBI 608 treatment significantly (p&#60;0.001) reduced the NQO1 expression at protein and messenger levels in both CRC (HCT 116 and RKO) cell lines.<br \/>Conclusion: Based on meta-analysis and computational approach, NQO1 is a viable biomarker and targeted molecule in CRC. <i>In vitro<\/i> results showed that inhibiting NQO1 with the drug BBI 608 decreased cell proliferation in both CRC cell lines. Knockout or overexpression or site directed mutagenesis is essential for a better understanding about BBI 608 targeted NQO1 and its amino acids.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Biomarkers,Bioinformatics,Small molecule drugs,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chaithanya Ganji<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Bhaskar VK  S.

In addition, the response to such therapy among patients with aggressive hormone receptor positive (HR+) cancer should be investigated. Neither the molecular mechanisms leading to good response, nor the criteria for selection of optimal treatment groups are known. Therefore, predictive biomarkers that identify responders to carboplatin in breast cancer are needed.<br \/>Materials and Methods: In the I-BCT phase II clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02546232), HER2-negative breast cancer patients (N = 187) were randomized (1:1) to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without carboplatin. Pre-treatment tumor biopsies (N = 178, N = 89 in each arm) were analyzed by reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) for expression levels of 494 breast cancer relevant (phospho-) proteins. Change in tumor size during treatment was used as continuous response measure. In addition, response was dichotomized with 30 % tumor shrinkage as cutoff. For the patients that received carboplatin, differential expression analysis between responders and non-responders was performed to identify proteins that may predict response to carboplatin. Gene set enrichment analysis on differentially expressed proteins was performed to identify biologically upregulated pathways.<br \/>Results: We found differentially expressed proteins related to response to carboplatin in treatment naive tumors. Biologically upregulated pathways have been identified in patients with high tumor shrinkage after treatment with carboplatin. The results demonstrate the importance of the pre-treatment protein landscape in prediction of benefit to carboplatin. Studies regarding biological mechanisms related to response in both TN and HR+ breast cancer, and differences among these subtypes, are ongoing.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study provides new insight into the mechanisms of response and resistance to carboplatin treatment in the neoadjuvant setting for HER2-negative breast cancer patients. The results support further studies on the protein landscape of tumors as a complementary method to gene expression analysis to unravel the molecular mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to treatment in breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Carboplatin,Proteomic analysis,Biomarkers,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maria Aanesland Dahle<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Eivind Valen Egeland<sup>1<\/sup>, Lina Prasmickaite<sup>1<\/sup>, Ole Christian Lingjærde<sup>2<\/sup>, Hege Russnes<sup>3<\/sup>, Øystein Garred<sup>4<\/sup>, Marianne  L.

Herein, we evaluated the ability of candidate biomarkers alone and in combination to predict objective response rates observed in solid tumor patients treated with the TROP2-targeted ADC, sacituzumab govitecan (SG), as determined in the IMMU-12-01 basket trial. We leveraged available next generation sequencing (NGS)-based molecular profiling data from an independent advanced solid tumor cohort (n = 23,968) and developed a multivariate biomarker algorithm that produced biomarker positive rates correlating with the objective response rates (ORR) observed in IMMU-12-01. Candidate biomarkers evaluated included TROP2 gene expression, proliferation (by gene expression) and tumor cellularity. Notably, while TROP2 gene expression was highly correlated with protein expression across 45 tumor types (r = 0.93), TROP2 gene expression alone did not significantly predict ORR across 9 tumor types (r = 0.40, p = 0.29). In contrast, a biomarker algorithm combining TROP2 and proliferation by gene expression with tumor cellularity strongly predicted response both when using tumor type-specific biomarker rates in a discovery cohort (r = 0.83, p = 0.006) and in an independent validation cohort (r = 0.82, p = 0.007). These results indicate that the multivariate biomarker accounts for 67% of the variability observed in response rates and may thus identify patients likely to benefit from SG. Among tumor types with objective responses in IMMU-12-01, biomarker positive rates ranged from 9.9% in colorectal cancer to 57.4% in bladder cancer. Additional tumor types with biomarker positive rates &#62;30% included cancers of the head and neck, cervix, salivary gland, skin (non-melanoma) and ovary, all with positive biomarker rates &#62;30%. Interestingly, most tumor types had biomarker positive rates &#62;5%, suggesting the potential for a tumor type-agnostic approach to patient selection. Considering SG and other ADC&#8217;s mechanism of action, a plausible model for response is that (1) higher target expression increases ADC drug delivery, (2) higher tumor cellularity increases ADC bystander effect and (3) higher tumor cell proliferation increases tumor cell death. In summary, we uncovered a novel biomarker algorithm capable of predicting SG response across solid tumors that may be generalizable to ADCs as a class, with the potential to further optimize use and maximize benefit.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Trop-2,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Biomarkers,Proliferation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nickolay  A.

Dimerization between IL1RAP and the IL-1 receptor is required for IL-1 signaling, and the IL-1 axis has been implicated in the tumor microenvironment and immune response to PDAC. Nadunolimab (CAN04), a fully humanized ADCC-enhanced IgG1 anti-IL1RAP antibody, blocks IL-1&#945; and IL-1&#946; signaling. Preliminary efficacy from the clinical phase 1\/2a trial CANFOUR, where PDAC patients (n=73) received nadunolimab with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (GN), show median iPFS of 7.2 months (iRECIST; 95% CI 5.2-8.5), median OS of 12.7 months (10.0-19.1) with 59% of patients alive, and 1-year survival of 57%<sup>2<\/sup>.<br \/>Methods: Patients with previously untreated, locally advanced or metastatic PDAC received nadunolimab at doses from 1 to 7.5 mg\/kg, in combination with GN. The exploratory objective was to measure serum and tumor biomarkers related to treatment outcome. Pre-treatment tumor biopsies were assessed for IL1RAP expression by immunohistochemistry. Serum from all patients was analyzed for biomarkers by Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) and Olink.<br \/>Results: IL1RAP was expressed on tumor and stromal cells in all biopsies analysed and IL1RAP-positive infiltrating immune cells were detected in biopsies from 94% of patients (n=38). The level of IL1RAP on tumor cells was associated with response (PR vs SD and PD; p=0.082). Patients with PR had a median IL1RAP H-score of 200, while patients with SD or PD as best response had a median H-score of 110. The data suggest a relationship between high IL1RAP expression and increased iPFS and OS. Reductions in serum biomarkers downstream of IL-1, detected by MSD, were also associated with response. Patients with the largest treatment-related decreases in IL-6 displayed a prolonged iPFS (p&#60;0.023), while patients with a decrease in IL-8 showed prolonged iPFS (p&#60;0.025) and OS (p&#60;0.041). Patients with the most decreased CRP levels following treatment also showed extended iPFS (p&#60;0.009) and OS (p&#60;0.008). A reduction in other IL-1-related biomarkers, such as CXCL5, VEGFA, EGF, Angiopoietin 1 and TWEAK, was also detected by Olink post-treatment.<br \/>Conclusions: Nadunolimab combined with GN shows promising iPFS and OS in 73 PDAC patients. In these patients, high tumor cell expression of IL1RAP, the molecular target for nadunolimab, correlated with response.

The mechanism of this resistance at such an early timing is poorly identified. Therefore, we conducted a prospective biomarker study to explore the resistance mechanisms to durvalumab after CCRT (Trial Identifier: UMIN000035916).<br \/>Methods: A total of 139 patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC enrolled into this study after dCCRT were treated with durvalumab for up to 1 year. 135 patients who fulfilled the predetermined selection criteria were included for this primary biomarker analysis. Archival tumor tissues collected before the treatment were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for several key biomarkers such as PD-L1, CD8, and CD73, DNA sequencing for tumor-mutation burden (TMB) and genomic profile, as well as gene expression profiling (GEP). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were also collected before and after durvalumab for flow-cytometry (FCM) analysis where available. Progression-free survival (PFS) was compared based on these biomarkers.<br \/>Results: Median follow-up time was 14.4 months. Median PFS was 14.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.3-not reached), and 1-year PFS rate was 56.3% (95% CI, 47.3-64.3). CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS), TMB, and CD73 on tumor cells were associated with PFS (hazard ratios [HRs], 0.40 [95% CI, 0.22-0.73] for CD8+TILs; 0.67 [95% CI, 0.40-1.11] for PD-L1-TPS &#8805;1%; 0.59 [95% CI, 0.34-1.02] for high TMB; 1.45 [95% CI, 0.86-2.43] for high CD73). Common pathogenic gene alterations such as <i>EGFR<\/i>, <i>KRAS<\/i>, and <i>TP53<\/i> were not associated with PFS. Multivariable analysis including key clinical factors as covariables indicated that CD8+TILs and the CD73-expressing tumor cells were independently associated with durvalumab outcome (HRs, 0.26 [95% CI, 0.08-0.89] for CD8+TILs; 5.83 [95% CI, 1.33-25.62] for CD73). The significance of CD73-expressing tumor cells as a resistance factor was more obvious in patients with high CD8+TILs (HR, 2.35 [95% CI, 1.14-4.86]). GEP of tumor tissue and FCM of PBMC suggested that CD73-expressing tumor cells prevented effective reinvigoration of antigen-reactive CD8+ T cells by durvalumab due to the immunosuppressive activity.<br \/>Conclusions: Low preexisting CD8+TILs or high CD73-expressing tumor cells were suggested to be primary resistance mechanism to durvalumab after CCRT in stage III NSCLC. Further development of next treatment approach will be prompted based on these findings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Durvalumab,Biomarkers,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Koji Haratani<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Atsushi Nakamura<sup>2<\/sup>, Nobuaki Mamesaya<sup>3<\/sup>, Kenji Sawa<sup>4<\/sup>, Yasuto Yoneshima<sup>5<\/sup>, Ryota Saito<sup>6<\/sup>, Tomohiro Ozaki<sup>7<\/sup>, Kenjiro Tsuruoka<sup>8<\/sup>, Akito Hata<sup>9<\/sup>, Kosuke Tsuruno<sup>10<\/sup>, Tomohiro Sakamoto<sup>11<\/sup>, Shunsuke Teraoka<sup>12<\/sup>, Masahide Oki<sup>13<\/sup>, Hiroshi Watanabe<sup>14<\/sup>, Tomoyuki Otani<sup>15<\/sup>, Kazuko Sakai<sup>16<\/sup>, Shuta Tomida<sup>17<\/sup>, Yasutaka Chiba<sup>18<\/sup>, Akihiko Ito<sup>15<\/sup>, Kazuto Nishio<sup>16<\/sup>, Nobuyuki Yamamoto<sup>19<\/sup>, Kazuhiko Nakagawa<sup>1<\/sup>, Hidetoshi Hayashi<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Medical Oncology, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, Osakasayama, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>2Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Sendai Kousei Hospital, Sendai, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Thoracic Oncology, Shizuoka Cancer Center, Shizuoka, Japan,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Respiratory Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka Metropolitan University, Osaka, Japan,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Respiratory Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan,<sup>6<\/sup>Department of Respiratory Medicine, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan,<sup>7<\/sup>Division of Medical Oncology, Kishiwada City Hospital, Kishiwada, Japan,<sup>8<\/sup>Respiratory Medicine and Thoracic Oncology, Osaka Medical and Pharmaceutical University Hospital, Takatsuki, Japan,<sup>9<\/sup>Division of Thoracic Oncology, Kobe Minimally Invasive Cancer Center, Kobe, Japan,<sup>10<\/sup>Department of Respiratory Medicine,, Iizuka Hospital, Iizuka, Japan,<sup>11<\/sup>Division of Respiratory Medicine and Rheumatology, Department of Multidisciplinary Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Tottori University, Yonago, Japan,<sup>12<\/sup>Internal Medicine III, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama, Japan,<sup>13<\/sup>Department of Respiratory Medicine, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan,<sup>14<\/sup>Department of Respiratory Medicine, Saka General Hospital, Shiogama, Japan,<sup>15<\/sup>Department of Pathology, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, Osakasayama, Japan,<sup>16<\/sup>Department of Genome Biology, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, Osakasayama, Japan,<sup>17<\/sup>Department of Biobank, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan,<sup>18<\/sup>Clinical Research Center, Kindai University Hospital, Osakasayama, Japan,<sup>19<\/sup>Department of Medical Oncology, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, Wakayama, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6c193b17-b236-47be-8569-9f0eb40b5b9c","ControlNumber":"488","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;K.

In particular, Glypican-1 (GPC-1), was reported to be abnormally expressed in BC tissues and GPC-1+ EVs resulted significantly higher in BC patients than in healthy controls. Triple negative BC (TNBC) is characterized by poor prognosis, due to the lack of effective treatments; in this context, Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) are regarded as promising agents; however, their impact is not the same as in other cancers, such as melanoma and lung. With these premises, the aim of the IRIS project is to evaluate the prognostic and predictive role of tumor and leukocyte-derived EVs in patients with early and advanced TNBC, treated with ICIs.<b><u>Methods<\/u><\/b>Twenty consecutive patients have been enrolled so far: 10 with TN MBC PD-L1+ treated with Ist line Nab-Paclitaxel + Atezolizumab and 10 with high-risk TN early BC treated with neo-adjuvant pembrolizumab (KEYNOTE-522 schedule). In all patients, 5 ml of peripheral blood in Na-Citrate were drawn at baseline. An optimized flow cytometry method was used to identify and subtype circulating EVs. EVs were identified as LCD+\/phalloidin&#8722;events, falling in the scatter area with physical parameters lower than platelets. CD45, GPC-1, EpCAM and PD-L1 were chosen as markers for EVs characterization. Data acquisition and analyses were performed with flow cytometry (FACS Symphony) and FACSDiva v9.0.2. Volumetric count was applied to calculate EV concentrations. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad software, and a non-parametric t-test was utilized for EVs characterization, with a p-value &#60; 0.05.<b><u>Results<\/u><\/b>Overall, a significantly lower concentration of circulating tumor-derived EVs (CD45-EpCAM+GPC-1+) was detected as compared to leukocyte-derived EVs (CD45+): Mean&#177;SD = 95.16 &#177; 219.3 <i>vs<\/i> 1623 &#177; 1582; p&#60;0.0001.

However, only one-third of patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) achieve pCR. Recognizing molecular markers that predict response to chemotherapy and selecting patients who can benefit from NAC in clinical practice has been a challenge in many studies. This exploratory analysis of the NACATRINE trial aimed to identify biomarkers that predict pCR TNBC patients receiving NAC.<br \/>The NACATRINE trial is a Brazilian, phase II, single-center, randomized, open-label study that compared adding carboplatin to sequential neoadjuvant therapy based on anthracycline and taxane for TNBC. We evaluated gene expression in untreated samples to associate with the response to systemic therapy. RNA was extracted from the tissue biopsy, and the nCounter Breast Cancer panel analyzed gene expression. Gene counts were normalized by housekeeping. For statistical significance, the t-test was used with a p-value &#60;0.05 and fold-change &#8805;2.<br \/>Of the 66 patients included in the gene expression profile analysis, 24 (36.4%) had pCR, and 42 (63.6%) had residual disease. Thirty-seven genes were differentially expressed when associated with pCR in the carboplatin arm and twenty-seven in the non-carboplatin arm (p-value &#60;0.001). We performed a linear regression model to evaluate gene performance, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to assess the predictive value of differentially expressed genes. Eleven genes (KCNB1, FGF1, SNAI1, CXCL9, FGL2, HAS1, CXCL8, VEGFD, HEMK1, MS4A2, and NFKBIZ) in the carboplatin arm (AUC 0.938) and eight genes (ALDH1A1, FZD8, HIST1H3H, CXADR, WDR77, PRKACB, JUN, and CDK6) in the non-carboplatin arm (AUC 0.943) was associated with pCR. Overall survival (OS) was higher among patients who had downregulated KCNB1, FGF1, and SNAI1 (HR = 4.43, 95% CI 1.00 - 1.58; p=0.04; HR = 4.92, 95% CI 1.10 - 2.83; p= 0.03; HR = 4.86, 95% CI 1.38 - 1.11; p= 0.01) respectively. Similarly, upregulated of ALDH1A1, CXCL9 and FGL2 were associated with a better prognosis (HR = 0.17, 95% CI 0.05 - 0.50; p= 0.003; HR = 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 - 0.50; p = 0.004; HR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.07 - 0.60; p = 0.009), respectively.<br \/>We identified potentially beneficial gene expression signatures (OS and pCR) for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, suggesting that these markers validated in a prospective study can be used in selecting patients for neoadjuvant chemotherapy in TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Pathological complete response (pCR),Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Carboplatin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ana  J.

To complement these existing approaches, we present a workflow that relies on high-resolution single-cell mass measurements curated with CNN-based image classification to characterize T cell activation and functional response to treatment with ICB therapies. As a highly integrative measure of cellular phenotype, cell mass can be used as a label-free biomarker for characterizing immune cell function. For instance, upon activation with anti-CD3\/CD28, T cells isolated from human PBMC showed a rapid and significant increase in cell mass. However, in T cells that had been repeatedly stimulated <i>in vitro<\/i> to generate a PD-1+ exhausted-like phenotype, this mass response to activation was blunted. We hypothesized that this variability in activation-induced mass response was the result of an altered balance of stimulatory and inhibitory &#8220;signal two&#8221; cues seen by the T cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, purified T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 alone (no co-stimulation) demonstrated a significantly smaller increase in cell mass when compared with those stimulated with both anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. Furthermore, the T cell response measured when unpurified PBMC were activated with anti-CD3 demonstrated an intermediate mass increase, suggesting contributions of both stimulatory and inhibitory signaling from other cells in the milieu. To explore how ICB treatment disrupts this co-stimulatory\/inhibitory signaling balance, we measured T cell mass responses for samples treated with anti-CD3 alone or in combination with pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, nivolumab, or dostarlimab. These samples included PBMC isolated from blood and tumor\/immune cell milieus isolated from malignant fluids (pleural effusions or abdominal ascites) collected from patients with advanced cancer. We found that T cells isolated from samples treated with both anti-CD3 and an ICB drug often showed a significantly greater mass increase than the same samples treated with anti-CD3 alone. This mass response showed significant heterogeneity across patients, with many samples showing no significant treatment effect. Despite all four of these therapies targeting ostensibly the same PD-1\/PD-L1 signaling axis, we also found significant response heterogeneity to these different treatments within individual samples.These results suggest that mass response measurements capture biological heterogeneity associated with ICB response and may serve as a valuable complementary readout to existing biomarkers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Microfluidics,Predictive biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Robert Kimmerling<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mark Stevens<sup>1<\/sup>, Selim Olcum<sup>1<\/sup>, Anthony Minnah<sup>1<\/sup>, Madeleine Vacha<sup>1<\/sup>, Rachel LaBella<sup>1<\/sup>, Katie Katsis<sup>1<\/sup>, Audrey Guo<sup>1<\/sup>, Juanita Fujii<sup>2<\/sup>, Zayna Shaheen<sup>2<\/sup>, Srividya Sundaresan<sup>2<\/sup>, Anobel Tamrazi<sup>3<\/sup>, Cliff Reid<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>TRAVERA, Medford, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Clinical Research, Dignity Health, Redwood City, CA,<sup>3<\/sup>Division of Vascular and Interventional Radiology, Palo Alto Medical Foundation, Redwood City, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0d4fc362-c074-4c8b-a786-c2c6702046e0","ControlNumber":"3718","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;R.

Although high LDH blood activity is often associated with high tumor burden, this is not always the case and there is no definitive demonstration that blood LDH activity is directly derived from tumors cells. Our objectives were 1) to explore the biological impact of LDHA and LDHB independently of their metabolic function 2) to explore the respective prognostic values of the 5 LDH isoforms as well as the relationship between tumor and blood LDH isoforms repartition in melanoma patients.<br \/>Material, Patients, Methods: A375 melanoma cells cultured in glucose or galactose (to evaluate glycolytic independent effects) were silenced for LDHA or LDHB expression using si-RNAs. RNAseq analysis of total RNAs and polysomal RNAs was performed to explore the transcriptional and translational impacts of LDHA and LDHB expression. In melanoma patients treated with immunotherapy, the enzymatic activities of each of the 5 LDH isoforms (encoded by <i>LDHA <\/i>and <i>LDHB)<\/i> were measured in tumors and blood samples. The prognostic values of the distinct isoforms as well as the correlation between the isoforms distribution in blood and tumors were evaluated.<br \/>Results: <i>In vitro<\/i>, independently of their metabolic effect, both LDHA and LDHB had distinct transcriptional and translational impacts on the control of several key oncogenic pathways (adhesion, survival, proliferation, immunity) with a more important effect of LDHA vs LDHB silencing. <i>In vivo<\/i>, among 64 melanoma patients including 25% with high LDH, high LDH1 (B4) activity was significantly associated with response and overall survival (OS) whereas high LDH4 (A3B1) was inversely associated with response and OS. LDH1 and LDH4 were associated with survival even among patients with normal LDH levels. For patients with paired (tumor and blood) isoforms analysis, there was no correlation between isoforms repartition suggesting that blood LDH activity is not directly related to tumor LDH. Conclusion: In addition to their metabolic activity, LDH enzymes, particularly LDHA, control several key oncogenic pathways at the transcriptional level but also at the translational level for a set of genes involved in cancer biology. LDH1 and LDH4 isoforms blood levels are differentially correlated with response to immunotherapy and survival. They are more robust prognostic biomarkers than total blood LDH level used in our daily practice. Thus, LDH is much more than just a marker of tumor burden in melanoma and the origins, the significance and the roles of blood LDH isoforms need to be revisited. These results highlight the need to develop anticancer drugs targeting LDH, and especially LDHA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Malignant melanoma,Metabolism,Translation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Laura Soumoy<sup>1<\/sup>, Virginie Quidville<sup>2<\/sup>, Lisa Fredeau<sup>3<\/sup>, Giuseppina Claps<sup>2<\/sup>, Caroline Pradon<sup>4<\/sup>, Ludovic Lacroix<sup>4<\/sup>, Emilie Routier<sup>5<\/sup>, Djaouida Belkadi<sup>5<\/sup>, Séverine Roy<sup>3<\/sup>, Feras Chehade<sup>6<\/sup>, Stephan Vagner<sup>7<\/sup>, <b>Caroline Robert<\/b><sup>8<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>INSERM U981, Gustave Roussy, Mons, Belgium,<sup>2<\/sup>INSERM U981, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France,<sup>3<\/sup>INSERM U981 & Department of Cancer Medicine, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France,<sup>4<\/sup>Cancer Genetics Laboratory, Department of Pathology and Medical Biology, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Cancer Medicine, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France,<sup>6<\/sup>Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France,<sup>7<\/sup>CNRS UMR3348 & INSERM U1278, Curie Institute, Orsay, France,<sup>8<\/sup>INSERM U981 & Department of Cancer Medicine, Gustave Roussy & Paris Saclay University, Villejuif, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6866460b-34dd-4d58-b1a5-df5f5b8eff86","ControlNumber":"4350","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

Hepatol<\/i>. 2022). ctDNA is emerging as a tool to monitor therapy responses and predict RFS in perioperative HCC studies.<br \/>Methods: We enrolled 21 pts who received 2 cycles of neoadjuvant cemiplimab (350 mg intravenous every 3 weeks), followed by surgical resection and 8 cycles of adjuvant cemiplimab (NCT03916627). The primary endpoint was significant tumor necrosis (STN; &#62;70% necrosis). Secondary endpoints included safety, RFS, and overall survival. A post hoc analysis examined pathological response (&#8805;50% necrosis). Pts underwent pretreatment biopsies and longitudinal blood collection for ctDNA analyses using bespoke multiplex PCR-next generation sequencing (Signatera). We evaluated correlatives of ctDNA changes and the prognostic value undetectable ctDNA after surgery on RFS.<br \/>Results: Median pt age was 68 years; 52% were Asian, 43% white, and 5% Black; 19% were also Hispanic; 62% had a history of viral hepatitis. ctDNA measurements at baseline and after 1 dose of cemiplimab were available from 19 pts who completed neoadjuvant cemiplimab and underwent successful surgical resection. Pre-surgical absolute ctDNA levels decreased by &#62;50% in 10 pts, including all with greater than 50% tumor necrosis. As of August 1, 2022; median follow-up for the adjuvant period was 23 months (interquartile range: 20-26 months). 8 pts of the 19 pts have relapsed. Pts with a &#62;50% decrease in ctDNA had median RFS of 28 months (95% CI 10, 28), vs 17 months (95% CI 4, not evaluable [NE]) in those with &#8804;50% decrease in ctDNA. 17 pts had a baseline ctDNA measurement, surgical resection, and data following surgery. ctDNA detection following surgery was associated with disease relapse (Fischer&#8217;s exact test, p=0.015), shorter RFS (median 10 months, 95% CI: 4, 28) compared to ctDNA-negative pts (not reached, 95% CI 13 months, NE; hazard ratio 0.14, p=0.006), and identified molecular relapse based on ctDNA with a median lead time of 5 months before imaging relapse. 20 pts (95%) were alive at last follow-up.<br \/>Interpretation: Changes in ctDNA identify early response to immunotherapy more accurately than standard modalities such as imaging, correlating closely with pathological responses and RFS. ctDNA monitoring during neoadjuvant treatment and following surgery may identify pts with early antitumor responses, improve the prediction of disease relapse or RFS, and inform additional early treatment decisions.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,ctDNA,Biomarkers,Cemiplimab,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Thomas  U.

The lack of novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets and the development of chemoresistance are major issues when dealing with CRC. The overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters is considered one facilitating mechanism for chemoresistance. Furthermore, several ABCA superfamily transporters have been shown to mediate cancer development and multidrug resistance. However, the role of ABCA5 in CRC development and progression is elusive. The current study aimed at profiling the expression of ABCA5 at the different grades of CRC.<br \/>Experimental Methods: Forty-nine (9 Well differentiated, 26 moderately differentiated and 14 poorly differentiated) primarily diagnosed CRC cases, and 15 normal colonic tissues were included in the study. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples were interpreted for the differential expression of ABCA5 by immunohistochemistry. The immunoreactivity of ABCA5 was assessed in the cells based on the staining intensity and the percentage of the positively stained cells to create the immunoreactive score.<br \/>Results: In total, 49 CRC cases were recruited, with a mean age of 63.77 years (range 33-86); 21 female and 28 male patients. All specimens were diagnosed as adenocarcinoma (NOS). Immunohistochemical analysis of the 49 CRC samples revealed diffuse ABCA5 immunoreactivity in the majority of cases. Seven cases showed mild expression, 25 showed moderate expression, whereas 17 cases revealed intense ABCA5 expression. Intriguingly, negative to a mild expression of ABCA5 was noted in the normal colonic tissues. ABCA5 intensity was higher in poorly differentiated CRC compared to the other grades.<br \/>Conclusion: Higher expression of ABCA5 is associated with CRC differentiation, indicating that it might contribute to CRC development and progression. Thus, it may be a novel diagnostic biomarker.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Chemoresistance,Biomarkers,Differentiation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Khuloud Bajbouj<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Latifah Alketbi<sup><\/sup>, Qutayba Hamid<sup><\/sup>, Iman Talaat<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Sharjah, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"42cab6e3-69a5-49c0-b4f7-491da9dd2d61","ControlNumber":"644","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

Accumulating evidence of anti-PD-1 therapy has showed improved survival benefit for esophageal cancer (EC) patients. PD-L1 has emerged as a crucial predictor for efficacy of immunotherapy. However, the understanding of PD-L1 as a biomarker is complicated by various immunohistochemistry platforms, PD-L1 antibodies, scoring systems, and cut-offs for immunotherapy. Although PD-L1 expression has been widely investigated, the real-world PD-L1 expression status in Chinese patients with advanced EC nationwide with unified testing platform, antibody, scoring system and cut-off is largely unrevealed.<br \/>Methods: The present study was a nationwide multi-center retrospective analysis of data from six centers in China from August 9, 2021, to February 28, 2022. Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnoses of advanced EC were included. The primary outcome was the prevalence of high PD-L1 expression in patients with advanced EC. Immunohistochemical analysis of PD-L1 expression was performed by using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay in EC specimens. PD-L1 protein expression was assessed by using a combined positive score (CPS). The CPS&#8805; 10 was defined as a PD-L1 high expression. The Chi-square test, Fisher&#8217;s exact test, or Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare the PD-L1 prevalence across demographic, clinicopathologic parameters, treatment status and other biomarkers.<br \/>Results: Out of 488 enrolled patients with advanced EC, 482 patients were included in the final analysis. For all testing EC patients, 207 patients (42.9% [95% CI 38.48-47.50]) were PD-L1 high expression (CPS&#8805;10). Between the PD-L1 high (CPS&#8805;10) group and PD-L1 low (CPS&#60;10) group, there were statistically significant differences in gender (P=0.046), alcohol consumption (P = 0.011), distant metastatic lesion number of patients with stage IV (P = 0.032), surgery (P = 0.012), systemic therapy (P = 0.004), and chemotherapy (P=0.004).<br \/>Conclusion: In summary, the prevalence of high PD-L1 expression (CPS&#8805;10) in Chinese patients with advanced EC in real-world setting using 22C3 assay is consistent with previous data in global clinical trials. Our findings of the related clinicopathological and treatment features to the PD-L1 expression can provide supplementary information for decision-making of immunotherapy and facilitate the better understanding of mechanism underlying PD-L1 and anti-tumor immunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,PD-L1,Immune checkpoint blockade,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Liyan Xue<sup>1<\/sup>, Jiaqi Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Dong Kuang<sup>3<\/sup>, Jingping Yun<sup>4<\/sup>, Yuan Li<sup>5<\/sup>, Lili Jiang<sup>6<\/sup>, Daoyuan Wu<sup>2<\/sup>, Pei Duan<sup>3<\/sup>, Shixun Lu<sup>4<\/sup>, Yan Jin<sup>5<\/sup>, Du He<sup>6<\/sup>, Jing Qian<sup>7<\/sup>, Wenmin Tang<sup>7<\/sup>, Yan Wang<sup>7<\/sup>, Jielin Li<sup>7<\/sup>, <b>Jianming Ying<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>National Cancer Center\/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer\/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Wuhan, China,<sup>4<\/sup>Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China,<sup>5<\/sup>Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China,<sup>6<\/sup>West China Hospital,Sichuan University, Chengdu, China,<sup>7<\/sup>MSD China, Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"499aa844-0c82-4bce-8609-625923ecce56","ControlNumber":"2712","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

ALK TKIs are effective and durable, but clinical outcomes after treatment discontinuation are unknown. We analyzed outcomes and minimal residual disease (MRD) in adult ALK-positive ALCL patients who discontinued ALK TKIs after achieving treatment-free remission.<br \/>Methods: Six patients who achieved responses to crizotinib (N=5) and ceritinib (N=1) were analyzed. RNA extracted from the blood or tissues before TKI treatment were subjected to multiplex PCR-based next generation sequencing (NGS) using ARCHER<sup>&#174;<\/sup> RNA Fusionplex<sup>&#174;<\/sup> to detect <i>NPM<\/i>-<i>ALK<\/i> fusion. MRD was assessed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after the treatment discontinuation. Undetectable MRD was defined as less than one lymphocytic cell per 10,000 leukocytes (10<sup>-4<\/sup>) in peripheral blood.<br \/>Results: Patients received ALK TKIs as second line (N=3) or third line and beyond (N=3). All achieved complete metabolic responses after median 28.5 months (range, 1.7-93.9) of treatments (Table 1). Before TKI, LY1 patient had no morphologic evidence of bone marrow involvement, but <i>NPM1<\/i>-<i>ALK<\/i> fusions were detected by NGS and ddPCR in blood, bone marrow, and tissue. LY1 patient remained in remission at 27.8 months after crizotinib discontinuation. In all patients, <i>NPM1<\/i>-<i>ALK<\/i> fusion were not detected in the PBMCs after discontinuing ALK TKIs for median 38.2 months (range, 0-61.9). No patient re-initiated anti-lymphoma therapies.<br \/>Conclusion: Out data demonstrated that treatment-free remission was durable for more than two years in ALK-positive ALCL patients following the cessation of ALK TKIs.

Despite the recent success of PARP inhibitors, advanced BRCA mutant and homologous recombination repair deficient (HRD) HGSOC, chemotherapy remains the first line treatment. Little is known about how chemotherapy exposure alters tumor heterogeneity and subsequent response to targeted therapies. Certain mutations may survive the exposure of chemotherapy better than others. The question of whether targeted therapies should be given before or after response to chemotherapy also remains unanswered. We use the principles of natural selection to investigate how HGSOC evolves over time and selection operates on clones in the context of cytotoxic\/non-cytotoxic combination therapies, and what changes in genomes\/transcriptomes at the single cell level drive tumor progression.<br \/>Methods: Cell lines ID8 <i>Trp53<\/i> &#8722;\/&#8722;; <i>Brca1<\/i> &#8722;\/&#8722; and WT were used to represent defective \/proficient homologous recombination were given intraperitoneally to C57B6 mice to develop HGSOC models. Transfected Luciferase expression in the cells used to monitor tumor response to olaparib (Ola)+\/- Bevacizumab (BEV-various doses) +\/- Atezolizumab (ATz) combinations by bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Ascitic fluid and mouse organs were harvested for the evidence of seeding and identification of biomarkers. In addition, 10 treatment na&#239;ve HGSOC PDX were developed in immunodeficient mice and treated with either cisplatin or olaparib. Single-cell whole-genome sequencing (scWGS) was performed using direct library preparation (DLP+). Hierarchical clustering and <i>Sitka<\/i> are used to identify the clonal structure of each condition following treatment. Phylogenetic tree was computed using copy number data.<br \/>Results: In the BRCA WT HRp study group, the greatest response was seen in the triplet Ola+BEV+ATz combinations and interestingly no significant differences were observed using a lower dose of BEV. Furthermore, from scWGS data of PDX passages we captured initial clonal heterogeneity leading to emergent clones. We found evolving copy number changes on chromosome 19, 8, 3 and loss of heterozygosity of TP53.<br \/>Conclusion: The triplet combination of low-dose-intensity bevacizumab with other non-cytotoxic drugs was an effective regimen for BRCA WT syngeneic mouse tumors. In HGSOC PDX, we are able to capture diversification between HGSOC PDX passages-specifically after drug exposures.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Tumor evolution,Chemotherapy,Single cell sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Farhia Kabeer<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Goldman Lam<sup>2<\/sup>, Naila Adam<sup>2<\/sup>, Maxwell Douglas<sup>2<\/sup>, Amal El-Naggar<sup>2<\/sup>, Forouh Kalantari<sup>2<\/sup>, Mengke Han<sup>2<\/sup>, Vinci Au<sup>2<\/sup>, Michael Van Vliet<sup>2<\/sup>, Cindy Shen<sup>2<\/sup>, Sean Beaty<sup>2<\/sup>, Daniel Lai<sup>2<\/sup>, Andy Mungall<sup>2<\/sup>, Richard Moore<sup>2<\/sup>, Sam Aparicio<sup>2<\/sup>, Andrew Roth<sup>2<\/sup>, David Huntsman<sup>2<\/sup>, Yvette Drew<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia Faculty of Medicine, Vancouver, BC, Canada,<sup>2<\/sup>Molecular Oncology, BC Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d077219e-9607-4385-9634-7a4ed342bc01","ControlNumber":"1725","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

However, there are at least 4 different assays and antibodies used for PD-L1 IHC, each developed with a different ICI. Spatial transcriptomic analysis at the single cell level can be helpful for deeply characterize the complexity and heterogeneity of tumors. We set to test if <i>in-situ<\/i> hybridization-based RNA scope coupled to single cell quantification is a robust method to determine PD-L1 mRNA expression levels in each cell and furthermore efficacy of predicting response to ICIs as compared to routinely used standardized IHC procedures. Method FFPE sections from retrospectively collected surgically resected NSCLCs (adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) tumor with progression disease or complete response from adjuvant pembrolizumab therapy were used. Target genes CD274 (PD-L1) and GZMB (Granzyme B) were assessed. For fluorescent detection, the label probe was conjugated to Opal 570 and 620 respectively. Tissues cells were counterstained with DAPI to detect the nuclei. A Digital pathology software QuPath was used for cell segmentation and dot&#8217;s detection for gene expression quantification and further classification. Results Difference in expression levels were seen between PD-L1 and GZMB across the tumor with PD-L1 staining mostly located in the tumoral area and Granzyme B in stromal area of the NSCLC tissue. This is consistent with the expected expression of PD-L1 on tumor epithelial cells and Granzyme B on T cells. This heterogeneity in the signal distribution specific to the analyzed tissue correspond to intra-tissue cells metabolism heterogeneity between cell types. This heterogeneity of expression was captured though a digital workflow capable of quantifying the number of cells expressing PD-L1 and GZMB. Among the cells expressing the markers, 96% were positive for PD-L1 for the tumor that did not respond to therapy with the threshold of positivity being set at 1 of dots, that corresponds to 1 transcript, per cell.<br \/>Conclusion Our results demonstrate that PD-L1 was highly expressed in a tumor context that was not responding to PD-1 ICI inhibitor. Measurement of mRNA expression at the single cell level on tissue provides another layer of PD-L1 detection which can be exploited to predict tumor response to ICI suggesting that moving forward with this technology is a viable approach for this dynamic biomarker.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-L1,Immune checkpoint,RNA,Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Amandine Gerstenberg<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Adele Ponzoni<sup><\/sup>, Corinne Ramos<sup><\/sup>, Jonathan Stauber<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>ImaBiotech, Loos, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ddbdad60-a506-4c32-85fe-836cc3401eb6","ControlNumber":"6906","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Conserved regions of ITAM and prenylation motif in MIEN1 were used as a template to identify anti-cancer peptides. RNA-seq, qPCR analysis and western blots showed changes in the transcriptome and protein expression after peptide treatment. The two bioactive peptides inhibited genes and proteins responsible for cancer cell migration and invasion in both MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and DU-145 prostate cancer cells. The mechanism of the action of the peptides involves the inhibition of key pathways like Epithelial-Mesenchymal transition and Epidermal Growth Factor-mediated NF-&#954;B pathway to exert their anti-cancer activity. Interestingly, the peptides targeted the same signal transduction pathways followed by parental MIEN1 to show its cancer properties. Thus, the two peptides acted as dominant negative effectors of MIEN1 activity. Additionally, Peptide-treatments induced apoptosis in mice groups bearing tumors derived from MDA-MB-231 cells as evidenced by increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP proteins in western blots. Interestingly, the MIEN1 mRNA and protein expression was lowered in the in vivo breast cancer tumor models which remained unchanged in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells indicating an improved therapeutic activity in living system. The peptides did not cause any toxicity in the mice group which received peptides only, at three times the dose used during <i>in vivo<\/i> assays.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Peptides,Therapeutics,Breast cancer,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>AMIT Kumar Tripathi<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jamboor  K.

Metastasis is a multistage process requiring displacement of cells from the primary tumor, survival in circulation, and adhesion and growth in a secondary location. Reorganization of both the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton is critical for metastasis of solid tumors. Drugs that inhibit microtubule dynamics, including microtubule stabilizers and destabilizers, are used to treat metastatic breast cancer, however there is no rationale to guide the choice among these drugs. Septins, a class of small GTPases, interact with both microtubules and actin to functionally link these cytoskeletal components. Expression of a specific isoform, septin9_i1, is associated with breast cancer development, migration, and drug resistance. This isoform is unique among septins in that it contains a specific microtubule binding domain required for association of septins with microtubules. We found that microtubule stabilizing or destabilizing chemotherapeutics currently used to treat metastatic breast cancer promoted respective microtubule or actin localization of oncogenic septins, particularly when septin9_i1 was expressed. This differential cellular distribution correlated with our finding that microtubule destabilizers were more effective than stabilizers at inhibiting the migration of septin9_i1 expressing breast cancer cells in vitro whereas the drugs were equally effective in isogenic cells depleted of septin9_i1. We are currently testing the hypothesis that septin9_i1 promotes in vivo metastasis of breast tumors and that microtubule destabilizers will be more effective than stabilizers at inhibiting this metastasis. This supports our ongoing clinical investigations to determine whether septin9_i1 expression could be used as a predictive biomarker to guide the selection among microtubule-targeted chemotherapeutics, which is significant as there is currently no molecular guidance to inform on this choice. Our findings will promote the more targeted and rational use of this highly used but mechanistically underappreciated class of chemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Metastasis,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Tumor metastases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jacob  N.

It is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. African Americans have a 50- 90% increased incidence of pancreatic cancer in comparison to other racial groups. 20% of patients with pancreatic cancer present with early-stage disease and will have a median overall survival of 2.5 years if able to undergo surgical resection. There is a desperate need to discover novel ways of treating pancreatic cancer. Understanding of the microbiome may be informative to overcoming chemotherapy resistance, toxicity and improving outcomes and disparities. The aim of this study is to (1) identify changes in the intestinal microbiota during neoadjuvant treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma that correlate with treatment response and (2) identify changes in the intestinal microbiota during neoadjuvant treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma that correlate with treatment toxicity in a diverse patient population.<br \/>Methods: Patients with resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer who are enrolled in a multi-site clinical trial (NCT03483038) receiving neoadjuvant NEO-Nali-IRI (oxaliplatin, liposomal irinotecan and 5- FU) followed by surgical resection were asked to provide stool samples and a dietary log during the following four (or five) time points: baseline, mid-therapy (after C4), at completion of chemotherapy (after C8), after radiation if applicable, and at 4-6 weeks post-operative. Participants will be given stool collection kits at clinic visits for home sample acquisition. All samples will be mailed to the University of Florida Health Cancer Center Microbiome Biorepository. Data will be collected regarding demographics, stage, medical history and concurrent medications including antimicrobics and probiotics, chemotherapy dose-reductions, delays, discontinuations, adverse events, safety adverse events, attribution of causality, and hospitalizations. Outcomes will include imaging response using RECIST criteria, CA 19-9 trend, development of metastatic disease, and the ability to proceed to definitive surgical resection. DNA will be extracted from stool and analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing methods to determine signatures and biodiversity. Descriptive statistics and correlative analysis will be reported. Continuous and categorical variables will be compared with Student&#8217;s t-test and Chi-squared test. Multiple groups will be compared by ANOVA. Kaplan-Meier logistic regression will be performed to compare outcomes between the different microbiota groupings.<br \/>Conclusion: Stool collection from a multi-site clinical trial is feasible during neoadjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer and can increase diversity of the sample population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Microbiome,Biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sherise Rogers<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ryan Thomas<sup>1<\/sup>, Brain Ramnaraign<sup>1<\/sup>, Ilyas Sahin<sup>1<\/sup>, Jesus Fabregas<sup>1<\/sup>, Karen Russell<sup>2<\/sup>, Steven Hughes<sup>1<\/sup>, Ibrahim Nassour<sup>1<\/sup>, Kathyrn Hitchcock<sup>1<\/sup>, Omar Kayaleh<sup>3<\/sup>, Anita Turk<sup>4<\/sup>, Ji-Hyun Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, David DeRemer<sup>1<\/sup>, Carmen Allegra<sup>1<\/sup>, Thomas George<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL,<sup>2<\/sup>Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, Tallahassee, FL,<sup>3<\/sup>Orlando Health Cancer Institute, Orlando, FL,<sup>4<\/sup>Indiana University Simon Cancer Center, Indianapolis, IN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"07fc0db7-7d38-4ee0-ac0d-d1afdb054cac","ControlNumber":"611","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

They constitute an essential part of the innate immune system playing a pivotal role at the front line of the host's defense against pathogens. &#947;&#948;-T cells have received particular attention as they exert multiple functions under non-infectious settings, most notably in carcinogenesis, where they can initiate a potent HLA-independent anti-tumor activity. Owing to these attributes, &#947;&#948;-T cells appear to be a promising target for designing cell-based anti-cancer immunotherapies. For such strategies - which involve manipulation of &#947;&#948;-T cells, e.g. by activation, tumor-targeting, or genetic modification - accurate and quantitative cell-counting tools are indispensable. The gold standard for immune cell quantification to date is still flow cytometry (FCM), although this technology is associated with demanding sample logistics as it requires suspensions of viable cells and presents challenges to standardization amongst different sites, cytometers and operators. In recent years, a huge body of evidence has been accumulated demonstrating epigenetic qPCR (Epiontis ID&#174;) as a powerful and FCM-equivalent methodology for cell quantification and immune monitoring, which is not affected with such limitations. Here we present a DNA methylation-specific, real-time PCR-based assay for the precise quantification of &#947;&#948;-T cells in blood, tissues and formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples. The qPCR assay targets a differentially methylated region in the gene encoding the constant region of the T cell receptor gamma chain (TRGC2). This marker region was shown being entirely unmethylated in &#947;&#948;-T cells, but appearing fully methylated in conventional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, in CD56+ NK and CD19+ B cells, in CD14+ monocytes and CD15+ granulocytes. Validation of the assay according to ICH guidelines and ISO17025 standards demonstrated a robust performance and stability, linear measurements in the operational range (between 0% and 100% methylation), a definite target cell type specificity and a good correlation to paralleled flow cytometric analyses. The intra- and inter-assay precision is below 15% and 20%, respectively and the lower limit of quantification, above where standard precision of measurements can be achieved, lies at 74 unmethylated target molecules. Cell type-specificity was shown using blood from heathy donors, the applicability in cancerous samples still has to be confirmed.In summary the epigenetic, &#947;&#948;-T cell-specific assay posted here may represent a useful tool for immune monitoring in clinical settings assisting the development of innovative &#947;&#948;-T cell-based immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Gamma-delta lymphocytes,Immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sven Olek<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Udo Baron<sup>1<\/sup>, Isabell Janack<sup>1<\/sup>, Kati Bourquain<sup>1<\/sup>, Stefan Kärst<sup>1<\/sup>, Deborah Phippard<sup>2<\/sup>, Laura Lozza<sup>1<\/sup>, Ciro Novaes Lino Rosa<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Precision for Medicine, Berlin, Germany,<sup>2<\/sup>Precision for Medicine, Frederick, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cc8545d3-85e8-4162-b2ec-dac9b39f3ccf","ControlNumber":"4692","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.
