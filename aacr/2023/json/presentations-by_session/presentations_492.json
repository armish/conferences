[{"Abstract":"Treatment of brain metastases remains a clinical barrier in breast cancer patients. Secondary breast tumors in the brain are reported to be enriched with breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) markers suggesting that BCSCs infiltrate the brain. Brain infiltration by BCSCs is complex involving detachment from the primary tumor, entering the blood, surviving the microvascular niche, and crossing the blood brain barrier (BBB). It is critical to understand how BCSCs move through the BBB to prevent brain metastases. Nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) transcription factor, Pyk2 non-receptor tyrosine kinase, and inhibitor of differentiation protein 3 (ID3) have been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of cancer through inducing CSCs or increasing mobility of these cells. Recently, we showed that NRF1-induced BCSCs crossed the BBB which were guided by ID3 overexpressing endothelial stem cells. In this study, we investigated the NRF1\/ID3\/Pyk2 axis contributing to BCSCs mobility. NRF1 promoted migration of BCSCs and mesenchymal MDAMB231 cells through brain endothelial cells cultured with astrocytes. ID3 overexpressing endothelial cells promoted adhesion with BCSCs and mobility of BCSCs across the BBB model. In addition, ID3 controlled Pyk2 localization which is important for mobility of stem cells and cancer cells. Endothelial cells were treated with a known risk factors for breast cancer, 17&#946;-estradiol (E2) and environmental pollutant PCB153. Treatment with PCB153 or E2 showed increased growth of BCSCs tumor spheroids and mobility of ESCs. Exosomal ID3 released from endothelial cells also supported the growth of BCSCs and provide the basis for paracrine effects by endothelial stem cells associated with breast tumors. These findings show for the first time a novel role for ID3 and Pyk2 by which endothelial stem cells support breast tumor metastases where they most likely facilitate the colonization, survival, and proliferation of BCSCs. This knowledge is important for pre-clinical testing of NRF1\/ID3\/Pyk2 modifying agents to prevent the spread of breast cancer to the brain.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ID proteins,Breast cancer,Focal adhesion kinase (FAK),Blood-brain barrier,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jayanta Das<sup><\/sup>, Alok Deoraj<sup><\/sup>, Deodutta Roy<sup><\/sup>, <b>Quentin Felty<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Florida International University, Miami, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"68ad8050-9049-4faa-9f23-13fd73ab9285","ControlNumber":"7211","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

PGC-1&#945; has been shown to promote cancer metastasis in mouse models of breast cancer while increasing both the global bioenergetic capacity and metabolic flexibility of breast cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanisms through which PGC-1&#945; contributes to metabolic reprogramming to support breast cancer metastasis remain unknown. To address this, we have generated the first transgenic mouse model of breast cancer lacking PGC-1&#945; expression specifically in the mammary epithelium (PGC-1&#945; null), allowing us to examine how PGC-1&#945; loss impacts breast cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. While no significant differences were observed in tumour onset or growth between wild-type and PGC-1&#945; null mice, lung metastatic burden was decreased in PGC-1&#945; null mice. Ion pairing liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was employed to measure steady state metabolite levels in mammary tumours collected from wild-type and PGC-1&#945; null mice. By integrating our metabolomics data with RNA sequencing data from wild-type and PGC-1&#945; null tumours, we identified potential deficits in glycolysis and aspartate metabolism in the context of mammary epithelial PGC-1&#945; loss. Interestingly, RNA sequencing further revealed the downregulation of several genes involved in extracellular matrix remodelling in PGC-1&#945; null tumours. Through immunohistochemistry, we further observed lower levels of &#945; smooth muscle actin, a marker of cancer-associated fibroblasts, in PGC-1&#945; null tumours compared with wild-type tumours. Overall, PGC-1&#945; knockout impedes metastasis to the lung in mouse models of breast cancer. Moreover, our transgenic mouse model suggests possible cell intrinsic and extrinsic roles for PGC-1&#945; expression, influencing breast cancer cell metabolism as well as fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix remodelling in the tumour microenvironment. By developing cell lines modeling PGC-1&#945; overexpression or knockdown in luminal B, HER2+, and triple negative breast cancer, we will validate the findings from our transgenic mouse model and further elucidate how PGC-1&#945; reprograms metabolism in breast cancer, how PGC-1&#945; expression influences the tumour microenvironment, and how these mechanisms contribute to cancer cell invasion, anoikis-resistance, and metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha,Cancer metabolism,Cancer-associated fibroblasts,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Emma Ciccolini<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Valérie Sabourin<sup>2<\/sup>, David Patten<sup>3<\/sup>, Young  K.

MSLN knock-out (KO) PDAC cells have delayed growth of peritoneal metastases in mice. Complementation with wild-type MSLN rescued the phenotype, although complementation with MSLN containing a Y318A point mutation to ablate interaction with MSLN binding partner MUC-16 could not. Mature MSLN is shed into the tumor microenvironment to generate soluble MSLN (sMSLN). We hypothesized that sMSLN would promote peritoneal metastasis. We engineered MSLN C-terminal truncation mutants (&#8710;599-WT and &#8710;599-Y318A) that lack the membrane attachment site and exist only in soluble form. Parent and MSLN KO PDAC cells were transduced with the vector constructs. These cells were injected into athymic nude mice and peritoneal tumor growth was measured 6 weeks later. MSLN KO cells complemented with &#8710;599-WT MSLN exhibited poor peritoneal tumor growth, while &#8710;599-Y318A resulted in growth rescue. We considered that sMSLN might exert a dominant negative effect because it competes for MUC-16 binding with membrane-bound MSLN but cannot facilitate cell-to-cell interaction. Expression of &#8710;599-WT inhibited tumor growth in parent cells, while &#8710;599-Y318A failed to do so. The activity of &#8710;599-Y318A in KO cells remained unexplained. We hypothesized that levels of mircoRNA-198, a purported tumor suppressor regulated by MSLN, might be altered by &#8710;599 expression and correlate with phenotype rescue. However, no change in microRNA-198 expression was observed in &#8710;599-expressing cells. We are continuing to investigate the mechanism for a novel activity of sMSLN that is unrelated to MUC-16 binding.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mesothelin,Pancreatic cancer,Metastasis,Cell adhesion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Neel  M.

YB-1 interacts with micro RNAs and non-coding RNAs in the cytoplasm, acting as a regulator of mRNA translation. YB-1 translocation into the nucleus is circadian clock-dependent and leads to the upregulation of cyclin gene expression, among others. Another mechanism of nuclear translocation of YB-1 is mediated by phosphorylation of the Ser 102 residue in the CSD. The YB-1 oncoprotein acts as a transcription factor when bound to DNA, modulating the transcription of genes that regulate biological processes such as Multidrug Resistance Mutation 1 (MDR1). YB-1 is linked to poor prognosis in breast, prostate, and liver cancer. Despite advances in biomedicine, the incidence and mortality of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain high. Sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase Inhibitor (TKI), is the first-line treatment for advanced HCC. Sorafenib also inhibits downstream activation of NF-kB by inhibition of Lyn phosphorylation (Y397). However, it was observed in many patients that its sorafenib&#8217;s effectiveness is hampered by drug resistance, but the mechanism is still unclear. We have found that SK-HEP-1 HCC cells transfected with a YB-X-1 overexpression plasmid subsequently developed into a stable YB-1 overexpression cell line (SK-HEP-1+YB-1) displayed increased invasion, migration, proliferation, and colony formation property as compared to the vector control (SKHEP1+Vec). The SK-HEP-1+YB-1 cell line also showed increased IC50 for sorafenib and elevated phosphorylation of Lyn (Y397) and further activated NF-kB (S165\/S176) phosphorylation. This indicates YB-1 may cause increased Sorafenib resistance in HCC by activating tyrosine kinases (TK), such as lyn, and simultaneous activation of NF-kB. The combination of YB-1 inhibition and sorafenib might provide a novel therapeutic strategy and improve the survival of patients with advanced-stage HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Long noncoding RNA,Metastasis,Anoikis,Signaling pathways,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ana  G.

TNBC is more frequently diagnosed in women aged &#60;40 and confers worse overall and distant-metastatic-free survival. Our lab identified a &#223;1 integrin-ligand, Semaphorin 7A (SEMA7A), that is increased in TNBC and young women's breast cancer (BC). Our central hypothesis is that SEMA7A is increased in TNBC and signals via &#223;1-integrin to activate epithelial-to-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) and chemoresistance. We have incorporated genetically manipulated TNBC cell lines and <i>ex vivo<\/i> tumor samples to define how SEMA7A expression impacts metastasis and chemoresistance. We have also incorporated our Young Women&#8217;s BC Cohort to analyze SEMA7A protein expression in human tumors and mammary epithelial tissue. In this cohort, we found that the normal mammary epithelium and tumors exhibit higher SEMA7A expression in women with postpartum BC, defined as BC diagnosed within 10 years postpartum, who are between 30&#38;39-years-old. This sub-population also has increased tumor-associated lymphatic vessel density, as well as increased lymphovascular invasion and LN involvement. Using a 9-month-old mouse model, which is equivalent to a 35-year-old woman, we have shown that mammary tumor growth and metastasis are increased compared to young 8-week-old mice, which can be mimicked by SEMA7A OE tumors in the young mice; these results suggest that the aged microenvironment can replicate the tumor promotional effects of SEMA7A. Similarly, in orthotopic models, SEMA7A<sup> <\/sup>OE cells metastasize more frequently to lymph nodes (LNs) and lungs compared to controls. Additionally, via a tail vein injection, we observe that SEMA7A OE cells survive in circulation, seed the lung, and outgrow faster compared to controls. <i>In vitro<\/i>, SEMA7A promotes migration and invasion via &#223;1-integrin signaling. Finally, <i>ex vivo<\/i> metastatic tumor cells, when compared to parental cells, exhibit evidence of EMP. Namely, prior to dissemination, SEMA7A<sup> <\/sup>OE cells are mostly mesenchymal-like. <i>Ex vivo<\/i>, SEMA7A OE cells from LN metastasis express both epithelial\/mesenchymal markers, suggesting a hybrid phenotype and maintenance of an invasive phenotype. Whereas those from the lung are more epithelial, which can be more proliferative. EMP is also known to promote chemoresistance and we have found that SEMA7A<sup> <\/sup>OE cells are resistant to caspase-mediated cell death in the presence of paclitaxel, a known chemotherapeutic utilized for TNBC, and have increased activation of pAkt, which can mediate pro-survival phenotypes.

Since most MB-related deaths are the result of metastasis, current standard care for MB is aggressive with intense post-surgical radiotherapies, which aim to minimize metastatic occurences and are applied in most cases regardless of tumor subgroups. Among the four molecular subgroups, sonic-hedgehog (SHH-) MB has a high prevalence and well-characterized profiles. A proportion of SHH-MB cases with higher metastasis rate and worse prognosis have been linked to aberrant expressions of certain genes such as <i>MYCN<\/i>. Strategies to target such pro-metastatic drivers have been explored but proven to be challenging. Therefore, discovery of novel targets in MB is an urgent need to optimize treatment and improve outcomes. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently emerged as malignancy regulators in many cancers. More insights into the role of lncRNAs in metastasis-promoting phenotypes, especially cancer stemness, would present both prognostic and therapeutic significance in metastatic MB.<br \/>Objective: To determine the role of lncRNA <i>LOXL1-AS1<\/i> in progression and metastasis of SHH-MB.<br \/>Methods: First, we used RNA-sequencing to screen for differentially expressed lncRNAs in SHH-MB cells (Daoy) achieved a higher malignancy level via MYCN overexpression (Daoy-MYCN), identifying <i>LOXL1-AS1<\/i> as one of the pro-malignant lncRNA candidates. <i>LOXL1-AS1<\/i> expressions and prognostic associations were validated in clinical samples and datasets. Next, MB cells with stable <i>LOXL1-AS1<\/i> knockdown (Daoy-MYCN) or overexpression (Daoy and ONS-76) were subjected to migration and invasion assays, as well as seeded in sphere-forming condition to assess sphere formation capacities and stemness marker expressions. Finally, we injected Daoy-MYCN cells knockdown of <i>LOXL1-AS1<\/i> into BALB\/c mouse brain to observe formation of tumor, metastasis, and survival rates.<br \/>Results: <i>LOXL1-AS1<\/i> was increased in Daoy cells under MYCN overexpression, was highly expressed in MB compared to normal brain, and was associated with poor prognosis in SHH-MB, particularly in the SHH-&#945; and SHH-&#947; subgroups. MB cells with <i>LOXL1-AS1<\/i> knockdown or overexpression showed a significant decrease or increase, respectively, in cell migration, cell invasion, sphere numbers, sphere diameters, and expression of stemness markers. Mice orthotopically transplanted with <i>LOXL1-AS1<\/i>-knockdown cells experienced a delayed tumor growth and metastasis development with improved overall and metastasis-free survivals.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study has proven the role of <i>LOXL1-AS1<\/i> in pro-metastatic phenotypes of MYCN-associated SHH-MB through a possible mechanism of inducing cancer stemness, which expands our current array of lncRNA candidates to develop MB-targeted therapies. The mechanisms of <i>LOXL1-AS1<\/i>-driven metastasis are being investigated in MB models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Medulloblastoma,Stemness,Metastasis,Long noncoding RNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anh Duy Do<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chia-Ling Hsieh<sup>2<\/sup>, Tai-Tong Wong<sup>1<\/sup>, Shian-Ying Sung<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan,<sup>2<\/sup>Laboratory of Translational Medicine, Development Center for Biotechnology, Taipei, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9919ac2c-1a8a-429a-ad49-8d1538114a99","ControlNumber":"4007","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

But we find that UNC5B is not a tumor suppressor of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC), and instead promotes metastasis. In TCGA data, UNC5B expression associates with poor patient outcome. In vivo, pancreatic cancer metastasis was completely eliminated by knocking out UNC5B from the genetically engineered KPC mouse model of PDACs, and was reduced upon knockout of UNC5B in a splenectomy model of liver metastasis. An inhibitor of NTN1, NP137, also reduced metastasis in vivo. In vitro, knockout of UNC5B from mesenchymal pancreatic cell lines was sufficient to reduce many metastatic traits including invasiveness, EMT, and aerobic glycolysis. YAP1 is a known target of UNC5B and was overexpressed in high UNC5B expressing cell lines, which were sensitive to the YAP1 inhibitor CA3. NP137 is currently in clinical trial for several tumor types and we have been investigating which patients might respond best to this drug. Using an antibody (D9M7Z) that recognizes an epitope in UNC5B that overlaps with the caspase-3 cleavage site that is critical for UNC5B's apoptotic functions, we found two isoforms in murine and human PDACs: one isoform that contains the caspase-3-containing epitope as well as a previously-unreported isoform that to lack it. Cells expressing the caspase-3 site were much more sensitive to NP137. We also discovered genetic alterations in patient samples that induce expression of UNC5B. For instance, UNC5B was recurrently amplified in PDACs and these amplifications were highly focal to the UNC5B locus; also, UNC5B expression was increased by mutations of ARID1A, a component of the SWI\/SNF transcription complex that is recurrently mutated in pancreatic adenocarcinomas. ARID1A mutations caused cell lines to become mesenchymal, but the cells returned to an epithelial phenotype upon knockout of UNC5B. In current and future clinical trials, NP137 may particularly benefit patients with tumors that harbor mutations in ARID1A or ARID1B, focal amplifications of UNC5B, and\/or high expression of the caspase-3-containing isoform of UNC5B.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,UNC5B,pancreatic cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chris R.

How dormancy is established and ultimately reversed to drive recurrence is poorly understood. Here we introduce a novel mouse model of pancreatic cancer dormancy in which we establish distal pancreatic tumors by orthotopic injection, resect them four weeks later and then follow the mice for recurrence. We observed recurrence patterns and survival outcomes that mimic human patients undergoing surgery for pancreatic cancer where two thirds of the mice succumb to early metastatic recurrence (median survival 26 days) and one third of the mice (called dormant mice) live substantially long (median survival 554 days) without clinic evidence of disease yet harbor disseminated tumor cells in most organs of the body. Disseminated tumor cells isolated from the livers of dormant mice were quiescent, exhibited stem cell properties and upregulated the expression of Dec2, a circadian rhythm gene. Overexpression of Dec2 induced quiescence suggesting that it may be a driver of the dormant phenotype. Curiously, endogenous Dec2 actually increased the growth and metastasis of nondormant tumors. Dec2WT and Dec2 knockout cell lines were used to generate resectable orthotopic tumors in immune-competent mice, and loss of Dec2 decreased tumor growth, dissemination and metastasis, and the median survival of mice with DecWT tumors was 25 days whereas 70% of the mice with the otherwise isogenic Dec2KOs were still alive after 200 days. Notably, these differences in tumor size, dissemination, metastasis and survival were abrogated in nude mice, indicating an immune mediated mechanism. Dec2WT and Dec2KO cell lines expressed the same total amount of the antigen-presenting protein MHC-1, but much more of the MHC-1 was present on the surface of Dec2KO cell lines than on the Dec2WT cell lines. MHC-1 requires peptide loading before transport to the cell surface, and we see evidence for reduced production of small peptides in the DecKO cells. For instance the half-life of luciferase, a very potent immunogen in mice, was reduced in the Dec2KO cells, potentially providing small peptides for MHC-1 biosynthesis. Protein turnover may be upregulated to compensate for increases in translation, as ribosomal genes are more highly expressed in Dec2KO cells, including many c-Myc pathway genes. Indeed, Western blot analysis revealed upregulation of c-Myc protein in Dec2KO cells. These data suggest that Dec2 plays a novel role in the immune system by decreasing MHC-1 cell surface expression through decreasing peptide generation, protein translation and turnover.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Dormancy,Metastasis,Dec2,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chris R.

The characterization of the NRP1 variants generated by alternative splicing mechanisms has provided profound insights into our understanding of the regulation of NRP1 function in cancer growth, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis as well as for the modulation of therapeutic outcomes. Here, we identified a novel human NRP1 splice variant resulting from the skipping of exon 4 (NRP1-&#916;E4) in colorectal cancer (CRC). We found that NRP1-&#916;E4 was largely expressed in CRC and significantly correlated with CRC progression. Furthermore, NRP1-&#916;E4 exhibited increased endocytosis\/recycling activity via secreted exosomes and decreased levels of degradation, leading to accumulation on endosomes. In addition, NRP1-&#916;E4 enhanced interactions with the Met and &#946;1-integrin receptors, resulting in Met\/&#946;1-integrin co-internalization and co-accumulation on endosomes. This provided persistent endosomal signals to activate the FAK\/p130Cas pathway, thereby promoting CRC cell migration, invasion and metastasis. Blocking exosome secretion, endocytosis or endosomal Met\/&#946;1-integrin\/FAK signaling using genetic and pharmacological approaches profoundly inhibited the oncogenic effects of NRP1-&#916;E4.

Mutations of the tumor suppressor p53 are frequently detected in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cases, which in turn correlate with high metastatic rates. To understand the mutant p53-mediated mechanisms in promoting ESCC metastasis, we conducted RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq and cytokine array on isogenic primary and metastatic tumor cells harvested from our mouse model of esophageal cancer, <i>L2-Cre; LSL-Trp53<\/i><i><sup>R172H<\/sup><\/i><i>; Rosa26<\/i><i><sup>LSL-YFP<\/sup><\/i>, in which we have identified macrophage colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) to be a direct gene target of p53-R172H. We have targeted CSF1\/CSF1R signaling to assess its pro-tumorigenic roles. In addition to studying tumor intrinsic mechanisms, we have established multiplex immunofluorescence and flow cytometry approaches to characterize the changes in tumor microenvironment (TME). Overall, this study aims to investigate the role and mediators of CSF1 signaling through its cognate receptor CSF1R by which missense p53 mutations<i><sup> <\/sup><\/i>can promote lung metastasis.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>RESULTS\/DISCUSSION:<\/b> We demonstrate that metastatic ESCC has increased <i>Csf1<\/i> expression compared to primary tumors and this is dependent upon p53 mutation status, which is reinforced by TCGA data and patient-derived tissue microarrays (TMAs). The TMA analysis also suggested that CSF1 expression is higher in tumors that are poorly differentiated. Furthermore, through the proximity ligation assay (PLA), we have identified that bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) protein BRD4, which binds to acetylated histones to regulate transcription interacts with p53-R172H at higher levels compared to wild-type p53 to induce <i>Csf1<\/i> expression. We show that the BRD4\/CSF1\/CSF1R signaling axis fosters tumor invasion, subcutaneous tumor growth and metastatic burden in lungs in a mutant p53 background. In accordance, targeting CSF1\/CSF1R signaling reduces phosphorylation of STAT3 in the metastatic tumors, which suggests a mechanism for increased invasiveness and metastasis. In parallel, upon inhibiting this axis, we have identified decreased infiltration of F4\/80<sup>+<\/sup>CD163<sup>+<\/sup> and F4\/80<sup>+<\/sup>CD206<sup>+<\/sup><sup> <\/sup>M2-polarized macrophages, as well as CD31<sup>+<\/sup> endothelial cells, and increased number of CD3<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cytotoxic T-cells at the metastatic tumor sites, indicating that the CSF1\/CSF1R pathway plays a critical role in shaping the pro-metastatic and immunosuppressive TME.

Confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that AnxA2 interacts with Pten in normal prostate epithelial cells and inhibits AnxA2 phosphorylation at tyrosine 23. Pten deletion\/mutation-mediated translocation of AnxA2 is dependent on the phosphorylation of tyrosine 23, and mutation of tyrosine 23 to a non-phosphomimetic variant inhibits the cell surface translocation process.

CRC survival rate drops from 90% to 14% when the condition is contained within the colon <i>vs.<\/i> when found at distant sites within the body. Metastasis is a multistep process and one of the critical steps for cancer cells to acquire <i>anoikis resistance<\/i> to survive after detachment from the primary sites and travel through the circulatory and lymphatic systems to distant target organs. Thus, understanding the molecular players involved in the anoikis process and metastasis could be vital for improving the survival of CRC patients. The aberrant expression of a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) has been identified in CRC. However, its role in metastasis processes is not yet well defined. Our preliminary results in the anchorage-independent growth (anoikis model) demonstrate increased expression of lncRNA UCA1. Moreover, the overexpression of lncRNA UCA1 led to high expression of stemness markers SOX2 and Kaiso, along with increased survival of anchorage-independent cells, which indicates a potential mechanistic role of UCA1 in anoikis resistance. Thus, in this study, we propose elucidating the role(s) of UCA1 and its associated signaling pathways during anoikis resistance. <i>We hypothesize that the overexpression of lncRNA UCA1 enhances CRC metastasis through anoikis resistance-associated signaling pathways. <\/i>We will utilize Isogenic CRC cell lines SW480 (oncogenic) and SW620 (metastatic) to understand the mechanistic regulation of anoikis resistance. Lentiviral transduced stable overexpression (SW480+UCA1\/\/GFP) and knockdown (SW620+CRISPRgUCA1) cell lines have been utilized for this study. After subjecting these cell lines (along with control) to anchorage-independent growth conditions, cell cycle, pro-survival, anti-apoptotic, stemness, and glucose metabolism factors will be analyzed through RT-PCR, Digital Droplet PCR (ddPCR), western blot, and FACS analyses. Utilizing the same model, we will examine lncRNA UCA1 linked anoikis resistance specific phosphorylation profiles of kinases, their protein substrates using the Proteome Profiler Phospho-Human Phospho-Kinase Array.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"lncRNA,Metastasis,Anoikis,Signaling pathways,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sophia Leslie<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kyle  D.

We found that prostate and breast cancer cells with high surface expression of the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 (CX3CR1<sup>high<\/sup>) account for ~5-7% of the whole population and are endowed with metastasis-initiating ability and exhibits stemness features, including expression of pluripotency genes Nanog and Oct4a.

Accordingly, when grafted as pure CX3CR1<sup>low<\/sup> populations these cells could generate disseminated tumors in mice, implying that MICs can emerge from cancer cells lacking stemness features.

The 5-year survival rate of ESCC is less than 20%, and patients with distant metastases have dismal survival with &#60;5% of five-year survival rate. Traditional therapies e.g., surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy demonstrate poor clinical outcomes for ESCC patients. Metastases are commonly seen in ESCC patients, and lung metastases approximately account for 5% of all ESCC metastases. The underlying mechanism of ESCC lung metastasis remains unsettled. In our study, we established ESCC lung metastasis mice model via intravenous injection of ESCC cells in multiple timepoints. Lung disseminated cancer cell (DCCs) of different timepoints were isolated and thrown into single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Via bioinformatic analysis, we found the upregulated genes in early-stage lung DCCs were highly enriched in embryo development, placenta development, pre-implantation embryos processes, neither in late-stage lung DCCs. It highly suggested that ESCC lung metastasis process might be similar to embryo implantation. Based on above findings, 5 intersected genes (GPRC5A, FSTL3, WNT7A, TM4SF1, NT5E) of early-stage lung DCCs and embryo implantation were figured out to construct an implantation-like signature. Enrichment analysis results implied that ESCCs subgroups with implantation-like phenotype showed higher ability to migration, focal adhesion and response to stress. Preliminary data indicated that the representative gene GPRC5A was upregulated in ESCC tumors compared with normal esophageal epithelium in clinical samples and public databases. GPRC5A overexpression promoted tumor growth, invasion, migration and sphere formation both in vivo and in vitro, as the same as other two signature genes, WNT7A and FSTL3. Moreover, GPRC5A-overexpresssing ESCC cells displayed high ability to develop resistance to stress and generated less reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vitro. In vivo, GPRC5A overexpression increased the quantalities of early-stage lung DCCs in ESCC lung metastasis mice model and disruption of GPRC5A expression abolished its pro-metastatic effect. Together, our preliminary findings identify an implantation-like signature in early-stage ESCC lung metastasis and disrupting this phenotype helps to prevent ESCC tumorigenesis and metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-08 Metastasis-promoting genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,lung metastasis,implantation,GPRC5A,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hongyu Zhou<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Beilei Liu<sup><\/sup>, Ching Ngar Wong<sup><\/sup>, Xinyuan Guan<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"87f17601-29a3-423c-b431-f1b258ea3a76","ControlNumber":"3293","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

Despite epigenetic alterations being a major causal factor in promoting tumorigenesis, relatively little is known about key epigenetic events that drive breast cancer lung metastasis. Additionally, the molecular mechanism(s) by which the loss of SWI\/SNF complex subunits-like Bromodomain-7 (BRD7)- induces incipient breast cancer cells to metastasize in the lung remains to be elucidated.<br \/>Methods: We established a novel <i>in vivo <\/i>screening platform which enabled the identification of specific epigenetic entities that regulate metastatic reactivation. RNA-seq enabled the identification of the differential gene expression\/signaling pathway profiles that govern metastatic reactivation upon loss of BRD7. Furthermore, tumor spheres and migration\/invasion assays were performed. To decipher the modifications in the chromatin accessibility upon loss of BRD7, ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq were conducted. A magnetic bead-based Luminex cytokine assay informed us about the regulation of cytokines upon loss-of-BRD7. <i>In vivo<\/i> experiments were performed in the 4TO7-TGL and D2A1-d dormancy models and the NSG immunodeficient mice. FACS immune-phenotyping coupled with scRNA-seq was performed to comprehend the changes in the tumor immune microenvironment upon loss of BRD7.<br \/>Results: The <i>in vivo<\/i> loss-of-function epigenetic screen revealed that loss of BRD7 led to breast cancer lung metastasis. Interestingly, RNA-seq revealed that BRD7 knockout promotes the expression of genes involved in inflammation, hypoxia and EMT. Intriguingly, the top signatures enriched in BRD7-silenced cells were IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling and TNF-&#945; signaling. Further, ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq experiments indicated that inactivation of BRD7 causes an increased chromatin accessibility at enhancer sites that were enriched for interferon-regulated immune response elements. Additionally, we found that BRD7-inactivation induces expression of pre-metastatic cytokines such as IL6, IL33, and CXCL12. Finally, the loss of BRD7 led to the up-regulation of the tumor-promoting neutrophils and CD8+ T exhausted cells while down-regulating the tumor-suppressive M1 macrophages, CD8+ Teff and Tmemory cells and the dendritic cell population <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Conclusion: Our novel genomic screening platform shall enable the identification of specific genes that mediate breast cancer lung metastasis. Additionally, our findings that BRD7 is a suppressor of breast cancer lung metastasis, and a predictive cancer biomarker could have major implications in the formulation of myriad chemo-therapeutic strategies for metastatic cancers. Taken together, we strongly anticipate that our study will bring forth a paradigm shift in our understanding of how epigenetic regulators, like BRD7, mechanistically regulate breast cancer lung metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-09 Metastasis suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Epigenetics,Immuno-oncology,Tumor suppressor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jayanta Mondal<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Junfeng Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Filippo Giancotti<sup>3<\/sup>, Jason Huse<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>Cancer Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>3<\/sup>Columbia University, New York City, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"39a968a9-e448-42c8-b7b0-0c2cfc52affc","ControlNumber":"2099","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Single disseminated tumor cells (DTCs), the seeds of metastases detected in the bone marrow, can be found still years after the primary diagnosis. We have shown that the presence of DTCs in the bone marrow at both the time of diagnosis and after chemotherapy is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in primary non-metastatic breast cancer. We identified retinoic acid-induced 2 (RAI2) as a novel metastasis suppressor gene significantly associated with both positive DTC status and poor prognosis, especially among hormone-receptor positive breast cancer patients. RAI2 sustains differentiation of ER-positive tumor cells, whereas loss of RAI2 induces hormone independent growth and activation of AKT signalling as an important mediator of dormancy control. <b>Methods:<\/b> Xenograft models were established by injecting orthotopically RAI2 KO (CRISPR\/Cas9 mediated RAI2 depletion) and parental KPL1 cells in immune deficient SCID\/J mice. A transgenic RAI2 KO (RAIKO) mouse was established with the CRISPR\/Cas9 system. The <i>in vitro<\/i> effect of RAI2 on the bone marrow cells was studied with osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation assays either with conditioned media from parental and RAI2 KO (MCF7 and KPL1) cells or with extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated by ultracentrifugation from the supernatant fractions. miRNA content of the EVs from the different cell line models was assessed by next generation sequencing (NGS). NGS data was validated in plasma from a cohort of bone and brain metastatic breast cancer patients, non-metastatic breast cancer patients and in healthy donors. <b>Results:<\/b> Xenograft experiments in SCID\/J mice showed an increased early tumor dissemination (increased numbers of CTCs and DTCs) when RAI2 KO cells were injected orthotopically versus the parental cell line, whereas the RAIKO mouse model showed that RAI2 is not involved in initial tumor development. Besides, both conditioned media as well as the EV fraction from RAI2 KO cells significantly increase osteoclast differentiation. Five miRNA candidates were identified to be involved in the RAI2-mediated crosstalk between tumor and bone cells. Validation assays on clinical samples identified miR-135a-5p to be lower expressed on EVs from bone metastatic patients compared to heathy donors and non-metastatic patients. <b>Conclusions:<\/b> RAI2 is a novel inhibitor of breast cancer tumor cells dissemination in the bone marrow thereby attenuating the vicious cycle of tumor crosstalk with the bone microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-09 Metastasis suppressor genes,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis suppressor genes,Disseminated tumor cells,Breast cancer,Bone metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Thais Pereira Veiga<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Stefan Werner<sup>1<\/sup>, Desiree Loreth<sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Horn<sup>2<\/sup>, Melanie Groninger<sup>1<\/sup>, Moritz Grabe<sup>1<\/sup>, Anke Baranowsky<sup>3<\/sup>, Hanna Taipaleenmäki<sup>4<\/sup>, Laura Brylka<sup>5<\/sup>, Jolanthe Kropidlowski<sup>1<\/sup>, Thorsten Schinke<sup>5<\/sup>, Klaus Pantel<sup>1<\/sup>, Harriet Wikman<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Institute of Tumor Biology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany,<sup>2<\/sup>University Cancer Center Hamburg, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Trauma and Orthopedic Surgery, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany,<sup>4<\/sup>Institute of Musculoskeletal Medicine, Musculoskeletal University Center Munich, Munich, Germany,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Osteology and Biomechanics, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f691d3cd-c637-4587-a589-d32e92eb14b2","ControlNumber":"1992","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

Therefore, there is a need to understand the drivers of the process to detect, target, and develop therapeutics to treat metastases better and extend their lifespan. Aurora-A Kinase (AURKA) is a serine\/threonine kinase that typically localizes in the cytoplasm. However, the nuclear localization of AURKA (N-AURKA) has been reported in multiple cancers and correlates with poor survival and the advanced\/metastatic stage of the disease. AURKA is often present in the nucleus of metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) cells and patient biopsies compared to non-metastatic cells. Moreover, induced translocation of AURKA to the nucleus in experimental models of TNBC results in a 5-fold increase in metastases to the bones, lungs, and liver compared to AURKA in the cytoplasm. We have previously shown that N-AURKA under normoxic conditions binds to HIF1A\/1B and leads to induction of hypoxia signaling via transactivation of Hypoxia Inducible Factors (HIFs)-dependent genes, including migration\/invasion, survival\/death, and stemness, promoting early cancer dissemination. Transactivation of HIF1-genes requires cofactor p300\/CBP. It is currently unknown if N-AURKA\/HIF1 transcription is p300 dependent. In this study, we used the small molecular inhibitor Chetomin to disrupt the interaction of HIF1A and co-activator CBP\/p300 in experimental TNBC and animal models combined with AURKA inhibitor Alisertib. Disruption of the hypoxia signaling pathway significantly decreases the transactivation of HIF-dependent genes, including migration\/invasion, survival\/death, and stemness in N-AURKA cells. Moreover, in mouse models, inhibition of HIF1 activity via treatment with Chetomin in combination with AURKA inhibitor Alisertib significantly decreased metastatic burden suggesting that p300 binding to AURKA\/HIF complex is critical for gene expression and enabling metastatic dissemination\/colonization.<sup> <\/sup>Our studies show the mechanistic relationship between N-AURKA and hypoxia signaling and lay the foundation for developing novel combination treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-11 Therapeutic metastasis prevention,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Metastatic tumors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Abha Maskey<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kristina Marinak Whately<sup><\/sup>, Elena  N.

Despite advances in therapeutic modalities, the overall survival rate for metastatic CRC remains poor. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify potential drug targets, which are associated with CRC progression and metastasis. One such target is Basic leucine zipper and W2 domains 2 (BZW2), also known as translation initiation regulator eIF5-mimic protein 1 (5MP1), a member of the basic&#8208;region leucine zipper (bZIP) superfamily of transcription factors. BZW2 is upregulated in some human cancers; however, its function in CRC malignancy is unknown. Thus, the role of BZW2 in CRC is studied.<br \/>Methods: To address BZW2 role in CRC progression and metastasis, (1) we compared the RNA expression of BZW2 in human CRCs with their matched normal tissues (controls), (2) assessed the protein expression of BZW2 in primary CRCs and in CRCs which metastasized to liver, (3) as CRC is a molecularly heterogeneous disease, we conducted <i>in vitro<\/i> experiments, in CRC cell lines with various molecular alterations [<i>P53, KRAS, BRAF, EGFR<\/i>, or microsatellite stable\/microsatellite instable (MSS\/MSI) status], such as colony and spheroid formation to evaluate role of BZW2 on cell proliferation, (4) RNA-seq experiments with BZW2 knockdown (shRNA) to identify its downstream targets, and (5) to evaluate BZW2 role in CRC progression and metastasis, using BZW2 knockdown cells in <i>in vivo<\/i> models of NOD\/SCID\/IL2&#947;-receptor null (NSG) mice to assess tumor growth and the extent of metastasis.<br \/>Results: Our results demonstrated that BZW2 is upregulated in CRC tissues, at RNA and protein levels, as compared to their matched controls. A higher expression was also noted in CRC liver metastatic lesions compared to matched controls. Immunohistochemical results, on invasive CRC tissues further confirmed the findings of high expression of BZW2 in human CRCs. Our <i>in vitro<\/i> results with BZW2 knockdown in CRC cells (HCT116, SW480, and HT29 cells) showed reduced colony and spheroid formation. RNA-seq results comparing the expression in BZW2 knockdown cells with their controls, demonstrated key genes were modulated upon BZW2 knockdown, including those for P4HA1 and the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), MALAT1 and NEAT1. Our <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments with SW480 xenografts showed smaller tumors in BZW2 knockdown as compared to those of controls. Knockdown of BZW2 in HT-29 luciferase-tagged cells, reduced metastasis in NSG mice, potentiating the fact that decreasing BZW2 would affect metastasis.<br \/>Conclusions: The results provide an evidence that BZW2 functions as an oncogene in CRC, regardless of their status of P53, KRAS, BRAF, EGFR, and MSS\/MSI. Therefore, BZW2 may be an effective target for blocking CRC progression, and development of small molecule inhibitors of BZW2 could serve as potential therapeutic agents for CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Metastasis,Tumor progression,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Prachi Bajpai<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sumit Agarwal<sup>1<\/sup>, Farrukh Afaq<sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Behring<sup>1<\/sup>, Hyung-Gyoon Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Darshan Shimoga Chandrashekar<sup>1<\/sup>, Shajan Peter<sup>2<\/sup>, Sameer Al Diffalha<sup>1<\/sup>, Moh’d Khushman<sup>3<\/sup>, Andreas Seeber<sup>4<\/sup>, Sooryanarayana Varambally<sup>1<\/sup>, Upender Manne<sup>5<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Medical Oncology, Washington University in St. Louis\/ Siteman Cancer Center, St. Louis, MO,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Hematology and Oncology, Comprehensive Cancer Center Innsbruck, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria,<sup>5<\/sup>Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Alabama at Birmingham, and Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ac3054a9-c354-4217-892f-1897aabf5916","ControlNumber":"6593","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

However, lymph nodes are often the first site of metastasis and lymph node metastases portend worse outcomes. Through cross species single cell gene expression analysis of breast cancer progression and metastasis to lymph nodes, we uncovered features that define the heterogeneity, plasticity, and immune evasion of cancer cells. Notably, a subpopulation of metastatic cancer cells in the lymph node were marked by high levels of MHC class II (MHC-II) gene expression both in mice and humans. Mechanistically, the IFN-&#947; and JAK\/STAT signaling pathways mediate MHC-II expression in cancer cells. Ablation of IFNGR1\/2 or CIITA, the transactivator of MHC-II, in cancer cells prevented tumor progression. Interestingly, MHC-II+ cancer cells lacked co-stimulatory molecule expression, engendered the expansion of regulatory T cells and blunted CD4+ effector T cells in the tumor draining lymph nodes and favor tumor progression. Overall, our data suggests that cancer cell plasticity during breast cancer progression and metastasis to lymph nodes endows metastatic cells with the ability to avoid immune surveillance. These data provide the basis for new opportunities to therapeutically stimulate anti-cancer immune responses against local and systemic metastases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Lymph node metastasis,Immunosuppression,MHC II,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Pin-Ji Lei<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ethel Pereira<sup>2<\/sup>, Patrik Andersson<sup>2<\/sup>, Zohreh Amoozgar<sup>2<\/sup>, Jan Willem Van Wijnbergen<sup>2<\/sup>, Meghan J.

It is divided in two major histological subtypes, being the Alveolar (ARMS) the one associated to a poorer prognosis<sup>1<\/sup>. The cure rate for these tumors is up to 70% for children with localized disease, but this numbers decrease notably to a 20% 5-year survival rate for patients that show metastatic spreading. However, mechanisms leading to metastatic disease remain poorly understood. Hence, there is an urgent need to better understand this process, which will hopefully lead to novel targeted therapies and improved survival rates for these patients.<br \/>Methods: ARMS cells (RH4) were injected in the gastrocnemius muscle of Athymic Nude-<i>Foxn1<\/i><sup>nu<\/sup> mice<sup>2<\/sup>. Primary tumors (800mm<sup>3<\/sup>) and peritoneal metastases (visible by IVIS&#174;) were collected, and RNA extracted. Xenograft-derived metastatic cell lines were obtained directly as a primary culture from mice metastases. Characterization of paired tumors and metastases was performed using Clariom&#8482; D microarray (Applied Biosystems). After data normalization and comparative analyses (R; RMA and limma), a list of differentially expressed transcripts between sample groups was obtained. These are being validated by qPCR and Western Blot.<br \/>Results: Transcriptomic profiling of tumors (n=3), paired metastases (n=3), xenograft-derived metastatic cell lines (n=3) and RH4 cell line (n=3) revealed 3420 differentially expressed transcripts (2747 increased in metastases, 673 in tumors). Several transcripts of interest are overexpressed in metastases samples compared to primary tumors as showed by microarray analysis and validated by qPCR. These targets are related in literature to metastasis in other cancers, as well as lymph nodes metastasis, which occurs to happen in our model and in ARMS clinics<sup>3<\/sup>. Additionally, some transcripts are overexpressed in tumor samples, which are linked to inhibition of proliferation and motility.<br \/>Conclusions\/Future Work: <i>In vitro <\/i>phenotypic characterization of the obtained targets will involve proliferation (MTT), migration (Transwell&#174;) and clonogenic assays, including loss-of-function (siRNA and commercial inhibitors). Using stable knock-out and knock-in models of the genes of interest, their role in ARMS metastasis will be further studied <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. The clinical relevance of these targets will be explored in several cohorts of patients by immunohistochemistry on Tissue Microarrays. Studying the profile of paired tumors and metastases provides a unique tool to decipher the mechanisms of tumor progression. Fully understanding the metastatic process will ultimately lead to the development of better targeted therapies and thus to improved outcomes for ARMS patients.

A better understanding of the cascade of molecular and immune events underlying evolution during tumor progression and metastasis may help develop new strategies to prevent and treat metastasis more effectively.<br \/>Methods: In this study, we utilized two mouse models of metastatic lung cancer: a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) with mutant <i>Kras<\/i> and <i>Trp53<\/i> (KP, <i>Kras<\/i><sup>LSL-G12D\/+; <\/sup><i>Trp53<\/i><sup>fl\/fl<\/sup>), which forms lung adenocarcinoma with high metastatic potential, and a syngeneic model using cell lines derived from the metastatic KP_GEMMs that faithfully develop lung metastases. Paired samples of the primary tumor, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, lung and subcutaneous tumors were serially collected at different time points (pre-metastatic, early-metastatic, and late-metastatic phases) and subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), scTCR\/BCR-seq, and spatial gene expression by using 10X Genomics (Visium).<br \/>Results: ScRNA analysis revealed large-scale comprehensive longitudinal changes in cell components throughout the invasion and metastasis cascade, which was validated by spatial gene expression. Furthermore, analysis of Visium data deduces the spatial information of these dynamic changes. We found that NK and B cells from both the lung tissues and PBMC mainly participated in the early-metastatic stage and vanished in the late-metastatic phase. We also identified a subset of tumor-associated Tregs (TA_Tregs) that existed in small amounts in the lung tissue in the pre-metastatic phase and greatly expanded in the late-metastatic phase. These cells were characterized by high expression of Treg-associated suppressive genes (Tnfrsf9, Tnfrsf4, Tnfrsf18, Traf1, Nfkbia), inhibitory molecules (Ikzf2, Il2ra, Tight, Pdcd1), cytokines and chemokines (Ccr5, Ccr8, Ccl5, Cxcr6) and other Treg effector molecules (Id2, Hif1a, Rora, Il1r2, Itgav, Stat1, Icos, Areg). The scTCR-seq results and trajectory analysis revealed the TA_Tregs might derive from minor clones of lung resident Tregs (LR_Tregs) and play an active role in remodeling an immunosuppressive microenvironment by closely interacting with other cell components in the TME.<br \/>Conclusion: By simultaneously characterizing cellular gene expression, immune repertoires, and their corresponding spatial information, we revealed the dynamic changes of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) during tumor progression and metastasis at single-cell resolution. The TIME of metastatic organs may be primed before the establishment of metastasis. Treatment targeting these molecular and immune events during pre- and early metastatic phases may provide a novel avenue to prevent metastasis of lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Single cell,Mouse models,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yanhua Tian<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jian-Rong Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Bo Zhu<sup>1<\/sup>, Jared Fradette<sup>1<\/sup>, Hong Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Chenyang Li<sup>3<\/sup>, Sijia Cui<sup>2<\/sup>, Daniel Kraushaar<sup>4<\/sup>, Junya Fujimoto<sup>5<\/sup>, Leticia Rodriguez<sup>1<\/sup>, Luisa Maren Solis Soto<sup>5<\/sup>, Alexandre Reuben<sup>1<\/sup>, Ignacio Wistuba<sup>5<\/sup>, Don Gibbons<sup>1<\/sup>, Cheng Chao<sup>2<\/sup>, Jianjun Zhang<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Departments of Thoracic\/Head and Neck Medical Oncology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX,<sup>3<\/sup>Genomic Medicine Department, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>4<\/sup>Genomic and RNA Profiling Core, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"30237f8c-4c5d-420c-81d4-9e1b3b65b62f","ControlNumber":"4575","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Determining the proteomic profile of metastatic melanoma lesions that develop within the same patient could help elucidate adaptive mechanisms that drive tumor progression during therapy. Tumors that persist through treatment and colonize distant organs adapt to and rely on organ-specific microenvironments. To assess how protein expression is altered in cutaneous melanoma derived from different metastatic sites in a single patient, we utilized patient-derived BRAFi\/MEKi and BRAFi\/MEKi+CDK4\/6i-treated samples from the LOGIC2 clinical trial. Eight cell lines were established from patient biopsies at chronological time points throughout treatment and subsequent post-mortem resection of the bone, ovary, and brain metastatic sites. While the initial metastatic tumor in the breast was BRAF<sup>V600E <\/sup>mutant, NRAS<sup>Q61<\/sup> mutations were acquired after treatment with CDK4\/6i in the bone and ovary tumors. RPPA was performed on six of the cell lines to characterize site-specific differences in protein expression. We detected upregulation of ErbB3 in the brain metastatic tumor. Since neuregulin 1, a ligand for ErbB3, is abundant in brain tissue, we tested its ability to promote resistance to BRAFi\/MEKi in melanoma brain metastases. Neuregulin 1 rescued the growth of brain metastasis cells and restored phospho-AKT and phospho-ERK1\/2 levels in the presence of BRAFi\/MEKi. Therefore, the ErbB3-Neuregulin axis may be targeted, for example by using ErbB3 inhibitors to improve response to MAPK inhibitors in melanoma brain metastases. Further studies aim to investigate the evolution of metastatic cutaneous melanoma longitudinally in response to targeted therapies. Site-specific signaling mechanisms will be functionally examined as possible avenues for metastasis-specific targeted therapies to improve patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Targeted therapy,Resistance,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Haley  P.

The incidence and mortality of this cancer have been increased, becoming the third most frequent cancer and the second more deathly neoplasia in the world. It is remarkable the impact of epigenetics in the colon carcinogenesis, classification, diagnosis and prognosis. DNA methylation is the most studied and important epigenetic modification in CRC. This phenomenon occurs early in the carcinogenesis with a global hypomethylation and hypermethylation of gene promoter regions, especially of tumor suppressor genes, downregulating its expression. Previously, we performed genome-wide methylation sequencing of paired samples from CRC patients: normal adjacent tissue, primary tumor and lymph node metastasis. BDNF (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor) hypermethylation was found associated with poor prognosis. BDNF has been associated with colon cancer before. However, the importance of BDNF methylation in colorectal cancer and metastasis has not been described yet. We aim to validate the methylation and expression of BDNF, related to stage and molecular classification.<br \/>Colorectal cancer dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was used to validate the methylation findings reported in our previous report (374 primary tumor samples and 74 normal adjacent samples). RT-qPCR analysis for BDNF mRNA was performed in six cell lines, using normal colon tissue as baseline and beta-actin gene as normalizer. In addition, we evaluated the mRNA expression of BDNF of 29 paired-samples of primary colorectal tumors (Stages IIB-IVA) and its normal adjacent (NAT) counterpart.<br \/>TCGA dataset showed that BDNF methylation in primary tumor is significantly higher than normal samples (P&#60;0.001). In addition, we found differential methylation levels between CMS stages (P&#60;0.001). In vitro results showed low expression of BDNF cell lines CMS1 and CMS4 compared to CMS2 and CMS3 (P&#60;0.001). In patients, we found that BDNF was downregulated in primary tumor compared to NAT (p&#60;0.01). Furthermore, we found that, BDNF was downregulated in TNM stages II-III, meanwhile TNM stage IV overexpress BDNF (P&#60;0.01). When we analyze BDNF expression related with CMS classification in patients, we found higher levels of BDNF in CMS3 compared to CMS1 (P&#60;0.001).<br \/>We propose that BDNF is being regulated by methylation in colorectal cancer and metastasis. This methylation would be a dynamic process that allow to inhibit or activate BDNF gene expression according tumor stage, CMS and metastasis phenotype. Further studies should be conducted to prove this hypothesis, however, the methylation and\/or expression would be useful as prognostic biomarker.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Methylation,Molecular subtypes,Metastasis,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jaime Lopez<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hannah Demond<sup>1<\/sup>, Alvaro Gutierrez<sup>1<\/sup>, Kurt Buchegger<sup>2<\/sup>, Aleida Vivallo<sup>3<\/sup>, Diego Carrillo<sup>4<\/sup>, Claudia Quezada<sup>5<\/sup>, Priscilla Brebi<sup>1<\/sup>, Carmen Gloria Ili<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Laboratory of Integrative Biology, Center for Excellence in Translational Medicine (CEMT-BIOREN), Universidad de La Frontera, Temuco, Chile,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Basic Sciences, Universidad de La Frontera, Temuco, Chile,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Pathology, Universidad de La Frontera, Temuco, Chile,<sup>4<\/sup>Instituto de Bioquímica y Microbiología, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile,<sup>5<\/sup>Laboratorio Biología Tumoral, Instituto de Bioquímica y Microbiología, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"33f3e511-86b7-4f8b-9f59-bf9cdfac1555","ControlNumber":"6277","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Accordingly, effective therapies are not yet available, and the treatment of metastatic BC remains an unmet critical medical need. Circulating BC cancer cells can colonize the lungs, bone, brain, and liver generating metastatic lesions, which lead to poor outcomes. Liver metastases account for 30% of metastatic BC cases, therefore causing the greatest therapeutic challenge. The first line of therapy for BC liver metastasis is typically an invasive surgical resection, which unfortunately does not always resolve the metastatic lesion and requires further treatment. Unfortunately, there is currently no therapeutic standard of care (SOC) for BC liver metastasis, and therapy is selected based on the molecular profiling of primary tumor and metastasis biopsies. The scarcity of reliable and biologically relevant human experimental models, to provide a deep understanding of the molecular interactions underlying metastasis, is warranted. In this study, we exploit multiomic interrogation of breast cancer PDX models established from primary lesions, and metastasis of the liver, to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying BC cells liver colonization. The results highlight global molecular differences between models derived from primary BC tumors and BC lesions collected from the liver. The analysis also reveals several genes at the DNA, RNA, and protein expression\/activity level aiding in the adaptation of BC cell colonization in the liver. These novel findings provide insight into novel mechanisms of BC liver metastasis and highlight several targets suitable for future therapeutic intervention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Liver Cancer,Breast cancer,Multiomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Gilad Silberberg<sup><\/sup>, Yaron Mosesson<sup><\/sup>, Haia Khoury<sup><\/sup>, Xuan Ren<sup><\/sup>, <b>Mara Gilardi<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Art Hanson<sup><\/sup>, Marianna Zipeto<sup><\/sup>, Michael Ritchie<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Champions Oncology, Inc.

However, to date, the study of primary tumors with matched metastases from GAC patients has not been conducted, mainly because the collection of such samples in clinics is extremely challenging. To understand the evolution of metastatic cells and their interactions with the tumor microenvironment (TME), we performed paired single-cell transcriptome and immune profiling of primary tumors, matched liver metastases (LM) and\/or peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC), adjacent normal, and blood specimens, a total of 68 samples collected from 20 treatment-na&#239;ve metastatic GAC patients. Our analysis revealed differentially remodeled TMEs across primary and metastatic sites, in particular, the B, T, and myeloid cells. Relative to normal tissues, the fractions of B lineage cells decreased significantly in primary GACs and were nearly depleted in LMs and PC samples. Consistently, T and B cell clonality decreased significantly in metastatic tumors, and the majority of the top expanded T cell clones were likely non-tumor specific. We discovered divergent evolutionary paths leading to diminished anti-tumor immune responses in the liver and peritoneal TMEs. For example, the Marco_c3 (highly expressed <i>INHBA<\/i>, <i>SDC2<\/i>, and <i>CCL20<\/i>) was highly enriched in LMs, whereas Marco_c1 (highly expressed <i>APOE<\/i>, <i>APOC1<\/i>, and <i>C1QC<\/i>) and proliferative macrophages were uniquely enriched in the peritoneal TME. In addition to TME cells, we defined normal epithelial cell states, quantified, and validated cancer cell state plasticity in paired primaries\/metastases, and linked it to site-specific TME architectures. Notably, unlike PC cancer cells that displayed a greater degree of chromosomal instability, most LM cancer cells lost their lineage identity, embracing markedly increased epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and &#8220;mixed&#8221; lineage states. Significant correlations between the fractions of TME cell subsets and the abundance of tumor cells in different lineage states were observed, suggesting potential crosstalk between tumor and TME cells. Lastly, we found differential activation of cancer meta-programs and gene co-expression modules (GMs) unique to metastatic tumors. Among them, high expression of GM2 in primary GACs predicts an increased risk of distant metastasis. In summary, this study provides a much needed and detailed understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of the phenotypic diversity of matched primary-metastases from GACs that have clinical implications. The single-cell multi-omics data generated by this study can serve as a valuable resource to the community to advance scientific discoveries.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-04 Expression profiling of tumor progression and metastasis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Single cell,Metastasis,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Enyu Dai<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jiang-Jiang Qin<sup>2<\/sup>, Jibo Wu<sup>3<\/sup>, Natasha M.

We have demonstrated that the proinflammatory cytokine TNF&#945; induces trastuzumab resistance through Mucin4 (MUC4) upregulation and it is an independent biomarker of poor response to therapy in HER2+ breast cancer. MUC4 is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in several tumors and it is involved in metastasis dissemination. Here, we evaluated the role of TNF&#945; and MUC4 in metastasis in TNBC cell lines and we assessed the clinical impact of MUC4 expression in TNBC patients. TNF&#945; blockade was achieved using etanercept (E), which blocks the soluble (sTNF&#945;) and transmembrane isoforms of TNF&#945;, or dominant negative protein INB03 (DN) which only neutralizes sTNF&#945;. BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell lines treated with E or DN exhibit a decrease in MUC4 expression. TNF&#945; blockade decreases the expression of the mesenchymal markers vimentin and snail in both cell lines. To assess the impact of TNF&#945; blockade on tumor cells and its effect on the tumor microenvironment (TME), we collected conditioned media (CM) of MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells treated with E or DN which were used to evaluate the invasive capacity of the TNBC cell lines. The invasion of BT-549 was impaired with CM-Eta (p&#60;0.01) and CM-DN (p&#60;0.01), and MDA-MB-231 invasive capacity was reduced only with CM-DN (p&#60;0.01). We evaluated MUC4 participation on invasion in MDA-MB-231 cell line transfected with a siRNA targeting MUC4 with or without DN treatment, and an invasion assay was performed. MUC4 knockdown impaired cell invasion (p=0.0001 vs siRNA control transfected cells). The treatment with DN of the MUC4-silenced cells did not further enhanced the effect, demonstrating that the impairment of the invasion is due to the decrease in MUC4. We determined the presence of TILs by H&#38;E and the expression of MUC4, Ki67, PD-L1 (SP142), androgen receptor (AR) and cytokeratin 5 by immunohistochemistry in a cohort of 55 TNBC patients. MUC4 expression inversely correlated with TILs (p=0.00013). Since TILs are associated with good prognosis, we evaluated the effect of BT-549-CM on T cell migration. CM-DN increased T cell migration compared to control CM (p&#60;0.01). MUC4 expression inversely correlated with Ki67 (p=0.016), PD-L1 (p=0.001) and AR (p=0.047) in our cohort. Moreover, MUC4 proved to be an independent predictor of poor overall survival (p=0.02), and is associated with a higher metastasis risk (p=0.005).In conclusion, TNF&#945; blocking agents decrease MUC4, mesenchymal markers and the invasive capacity of TNBC cells, and in turn increase human T cell migration. MUC4 is an independent biomarker of poor overall survival, it is associated with an increased risk of metastasis and immune desert tumors. We propose TNF&#945; as a new target for the treatment of TNBC, and MUC4 as a predictive marker to guide a combined treatment of TNF&#945; blockers with chemotherapy or immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-07 Invasion and migration,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),TNF-&#945;,Metastasis,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Florencia Mauro<sup>1<\/sup>, Sofia Bruni<sup>1<\/sup>, Agustina Dupont<sup>2<\/sup>, Gloria Inurrigarro<sup>2<\/sup>, Silvina Figurelli<sup>3<\/sup>, Sabrina Barchuk<sup>4<\/sup>, Daniel Lopez Della Vecchia<sup>4<\/sup>, Rosalia Cordo Russo<sup>1<\/sup>, Ernesto Gil Deza<sup>5<\/sup>, María Florencia Mercogliano<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Roxana Schillaci<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>IBYME-CONICET (Instituto de Biología y Medicina Experimental), Buenos Aires, Argentina,<sup>2<\/sup>Servicio de Patología Sanatorio Mater Dei, Buenos Aires, Argentina,<sup>3<\/sup>Servicio de Patología, Hospital Juan A.

Despite the use of chemotherapy and surgery, the survival of patients with metastasis is still dismal. We have previously reported that a high serum level of CXCL10 is associated with a poor prognosis and metastasis in osteosarcoma, suggesting that the chemokine may affect the development of metastasis. Nonetheless, the effect of endocrine signaling of CXCL10 is largely unknown. It is unclear if the prognostic effect of circulating CXCL10 is due to its metastasis-promoting effect or if CXCL10 is merely a biomarker. In this study, we employed orthotopic xenograft mouse models to examine the effect of circulating CXCL10 with respect to metastasis. We first injected luciferase-labeled 143B osteosarcoma cells into the tibia of NOD\/SCID mice to generate an orthotopic xenograft mouse model. When the tumor was detectable by bioluminescence, we injected 1.5ug of CXCL10 protein or saline intravenously via the tail vein every day for two weeks. The development of pulmonary metastasis was monitored by bioluminescence. The mice were sacrificed at the endpoint when bioluminescence was detected in the lungs. The mouse lungs were then resected and examined by H&#38;E staining for the detection of metastatic nodules. The mice in the experimental and control groups that developed lung metastases were compared. The results showed that no significant difference was observed between the two groups. The experiment was repeated one more time and similar results were observed. To investigate the influence of the cell line background, we analyzed another osteosarcoma cell line, MG63.3. No significant difference in metastasis development was observed between the mice injected with CXCL10 and the mice injected with saline. The results indicate that a higher level of circulating CXCL10 alone was not sufficient to promote pulmonary metastases in the orthotopic xenograft mouse models. We also showed that AKT phosphorylation was upregulated in the osteosarcoma cell lines incubated with CXCL10, ruling out that the CXCL10 protein used was biologically inactive. In summary, our results suggest that although an increased circulating level of CXCL10 is associated with a poor prognosis in osteosarcoma patients, it does not promote the development of pulmonary metastasis in xenograft mouse models. Circulating CXCL10 may only act as a prognostic biomarker, but not a metastatic driver. Alternatively, the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis may be necessary, but not sufficient, to cause metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Chemokines,Metastasis,Orthotopic models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Xiang Chen<sup><\/sup>, Margaret Clement<sup><\/sup>, John Hicks<sup><\/sup>, <b>Tsz Kwong Man<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e9faf2e5-566a-460b-a904-f9831d696b53","ControlNumber":"2929","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>X.
