[{"Abstract":"Selpercatinib (LOXO-292, LY3527723) and pralsetinib (BLU-667) are first-in-class RET-targeted cancer therapy drugs. However, secondary RET mutations that confer selpercatinib\/pralsetinib resistance have been identified, necessitating development of next-generation RET Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). While the G810C\/R\/S\/V mutations located at the RET kinase solvent-front site were detected in selpercatinib-treated patients, it was unclear whether all of these and other potential G810 mutants are resistant to selpercatinib and pralsetinib. We profiled selpercatinib and pralsetinib on all six possible G810 mutants derived from single nucleotide substitution. Surprisingly, the G810V mutant found in a clinical study was not resistant to selpercatinib or pralsetinib. Besides G810C\/R\/S, G810D also conferred selpercatinib\/pralsetinib resistance. We found that alkynyl nicotinamide compounds such as HSN608 have better drug-like properties than alkynyl benzamides. HSN608 inhibited RET and RET V804M gatekeeper mutant, and all six G810 mutants with low nanomolar IC<sub>50<\/sub>s in the BaF3\/KIF5B-RET mutant cell model. In cell derived xenograft (CDX) tumors driven by KIF5B-RET(G810C), HSN608 caused regression of the selpercatinib-resistant tumors. This study clarifies the sensitivities of different RET solvent-front mutants to selpercatinib and pralsetinib, and identifies an alkylnyl nicotinamide-based RET TKI for inhibiting selpercatinib\/pralsetinib-resistant G810 mutants.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"RET,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Drug resistance,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ujjwol Khatri<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Neetu Dayal<sup>2<\/sup>, Xueqing Hu<sup>1<\/sup>, Elizabeth Larocque<sup>2<\/sup>, Nimishetti Naganna<sup>2<\/sup>, Tao Shen<sup>1<\/sup>, Xuan Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Frederick W.

In addition to the primary genetic driving mutations, the downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway comprising the transcriptional coactivators YAP1 and TAZ and the TEAD transcription factors can be activated upon prolonged inhibition of other oncogenic pathways such as EGFR and MAPK. We showed that combining the novel, paralog selective TEAD inhibitor, IK-930, with osimertinib or trametinib in EGFR or KRAS mutated tumors, led to enhanced apoptosis <i>in vitro<\/i> and beneficial antitumor activity <i>in vivo<\/i>. Experimental models demonstrated that upon inhibition of EGFR with osimertinib, a subpopulation of drug tolerant cells defined as &#8216;persisters&#8217; can survive treatment allowing for the accumulation of additional genetic and epigenetic alterations. These alterations in the persister cells can give rise to resistant tumors and cancer relapse. Previous studies have implicated YAP\/TEAD signaling in the emergence and survival of the persister cells.<br \/>To investigate the role of YAP\/TEAD signaling in persister cell emergence, EGFR and KRAS mutant NSCLC cell lines were engineered to express a TEAD luciferase reporter. Treatment with EGFR or MEK inhibitors, at concentrations that do not elicit significant cell death, induced TEAD-mediated transcription after several days of treatment, indicative of an adaptive response to chronic target inhibition. Concurrent treatment with the TEAD inhibitor, IK-930, abolished TEAD-mediated transcription. Using time lapse microscopy, the cell cycle and proliferation of EGFR mutant cultured cells, engineered to express a fluorescence-based cell-cycle indicator (FUCCI), were quantified when treated with osimertinib alone or combined with IK-930. Treatment with osimertinib led to a rapid induction of cell death. However, after several days, a drug tolerant population emerged and reentered the cell cycle even with chronic osimertinib treatment. Interestingly, the emergence of these persister cells coincided with maximum TEAD activity. Concurrent addition of IK-930, as well as addition of IK-930 after the emergence of the osimertinib-tolerant persister cells, attenuated cell proliferation and expansion, demonstrating the potential for IK-930 to prevent resistance to EGFR inhibitors and even reverse the effect when given after resistance has already emerged. Current efforts are focused on the characterization of the persister population and on evaluating the role of YAP\/TEAD signaling in resistance to other targeted therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR TKI resistance,Combination therapy,Hippo pathway,KRAS,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Daniel Hidalgo<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Marta Sanchez-Martin<sup><\/sup>, Mihir Rajurkar<sup><\/sup>, George Punkosdy<sup><\/sup>, Jeffrey Ecsedy<sup><\/sup>, Lan Xu<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Ikena Oncology, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4965ea68-0d43-4c73-90d1-6bcf0902d0c9","ControlNumber":"4601","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

A major obstacle for the treatment of oncogene driven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is both <i>de novo<\/i> and acquired resistance to targeted therapies. Approximately 4-6% of NSCLC patients harbor <i>MET<\/i> amplifications\/mutations which are important targetable oncogenic drivers in the clinic. In addition, <i>MET<\/i> amplification has also emerged as a common mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs as well as other targeted therapies. Crizotinib, tepotinib and capmatinib are FDA approved MET TKIs for <i>MET<\/i> exon 14 skipping mutant NSCLC and have shown activity against <i>MET <\/i>amplified NSCLC as well. Despite high response rates with these newer TKIs, the majority of patients with targetable <i>MET<\/i> alterations fail to respond and acquired resistance is inevitable. Multiple molecular mechanisms of MET TKIs resistance encompassing both on-target (HGF overexpression) and bypass have been identified. Furthermore, at the time of resistance, an epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) phenotype is often observed. We have found that HGF\/MET pathway is a major regulator of the TWIST1, TWIST1 is required for <i>MET<\/i> altered NSCLC and cooperatives with HGF <i>in vivo<\/i> during tumorigenesis. Here, we reported that EMT transcription factor TWIST1 mediates a bypass of a MET TKI-mediated p27-dependent growth arrest. To study the mechanism of TKI resistance in <i>MET<\/i> altered NSCLC, we used multiple <i>MET<\/i> dysregulated human cell lines (H1437, H596, H1993, and H1648), a novel acquired resistance model of MET TKI resistance (H1993-CR cells), two syngeneic tobacco carcinogen induced mouse lung cell lines (FVBW-17 and FVBCH-17), and three different animal models (mouse xenografts, PDXs, transgenic animals). We found that TWIST1 overexpression led to MET TKI resistance <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i> in <i>MET<\/i> altered cell lines by overcoming cell cycle arrest. This was accompanied by a failure to induce p27 in the presence of TWIST1 overexpression. Similarly, loss of p27 induction and G1 arrest was also observed in our model of acquired MET TKI resistance. Conversely, TWIST1 inhibition restore sensitivity to TKIs <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> and lead to induction of p27. p27 appears to be require for MET TKI induced cell cycle arrest and sensitivity as silencing p27 lead to MET TKI resistance. Our findings suggest that targeting TWIST1 may be an effective therapeutic strategy to overcome HGF-MET-driven resistance in <i>MET<\/i>-driven NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Drug resistance,Cell cycle arrest,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Vinod Kumar<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Zachary  A.

Some studies have reported that Wnt signaling pathway activation promoted cell proliferation and was correlated with chemo-resistance in SCLC. None of the therapies targeting Wnt pathway components of the transmembrane and the cytoplasm have been successful in a clinical application due to toxicity and insufficient efficacy. However, targeting Wnt signaling inside the nucleus has been drawing increasing attention as cancer therapeutics. TRAF2 and NCK-interacting protein kinase (TNIK), which interacts with downstream effectors, TCF4\/&#946;-catenin transcriptional complex, is an essential activator of Wnt target genes. TNIK is highly expressed in several cancers for cell proliferation, thus TNIK is expected as a novel druggable target. On the other hand, the question remains whether TNIK is a critical target in SCLC. We hypothesize that a TNIK inhibitor has potent anti-tumor effects in SCLC and its promising biomarkers exist.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We used 29 SCLC cell lines including all four subtypes defined by differential expression of transcription factors ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, and inflamed gene signature (SCLC-A, N, P, and I, respectively) to evaluate the effect of a TNIK inhibitor, NCB-0846 in vitro.

Targeted therapies directed against tumor initiating growth factor receptors are effective treatment options for driver mutation positive NSCLC. Osimertinib is a third-generation EGFR-Tyrosine Kinase inhibitor (TKI) that has activity against EGFR exon 19, exon 21, and T790M mutations. Unfortunately, Osimertinib treated patients acquire resistance and median progression free survival is 18 months. Moreover, Osimertinib does not cure stage IV EGFR mutant NSCLC. The acquisition of secondary mutations leading to activation of bypass pathways, MET amplification, EMT, compensatory pathway activation and histological transformation to small cell phenotype are major causes of acquiring resistance to EGFR TKIs. Proliferating cancer cells regularly experience a low level of replication stress. Additionally, receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR are known to interact with DNA repair proteins and impact DNA damage repair following chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and EGFR TKI treatment. However, the role of DNA repair pathways in EGFR-TKI resistance is unknown and the interaction between EGFR pathway, DNA damage, and repair pathways has not been fully elucidated. At low-level replicative stress promotes genomic instability but at a high level through mitotic catastrophe it causes cell death. Replication protein A is a critical sensor of the DNA damage response detecting replication stress. The small molecule inhibitor of RPA, NERx 329, sequesters active RPA and induces replication catastrophe and cell death. Here we demonstrate that NERx329 in combination with Osimertinib enhanced Osimertinib mediated cell death. CCk-8 assays performed after 48h of NERx329 and Osimertinib combination treatment result in a robust decrease in IC<sub>50<\/sub> compared to single agent therapy. Dissection of signaling pathways leading to this death-promoting effect of NERx329 showed a combination of bypass pathway marker (AXL) and compensatory pathway marker (STAT) inhibition in AXL-high expressing EGFR mutant lung cancer cells. Whereas inhibition of STAT pathway was responsible for the death-promoting effect of NERx329 in AXL-low expressing EGFR mutant lung cancer cells. AXL and STAT inhibition are associated with induced DNA damage and impaired DNA repair. From these data, we infer that DNA damage repair pathways could be involved in TKI resistance and NERx329 could be a promising drug candidate for combination targeted therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,Therapy resistance,DNA replication,Signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Reshma Bhowmick<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, John  J.

The majority of patients demonstrated a prolonged progression free survival. While this early clinical evidence is highly encouraging, the biological determinants of elraglusib response are unknown. <i>In vitro <\/i>screens of elraglusib on pancreatic PDX cell lines showed that some tumor cells possess modest intrinsic resistance to elraglusib as measured by LD50 which ranged from 316.9 nM to 1080 nM in a screen of 10 cell lines. To explore this phenomena further, we induced resistance in three cell line models by growing cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of elraglusib. We then sequenced the transcriptome of the parental and resistant lines to identify potential mechanisms of elraglusib resistance. Comparison of RNA sequencing profiles identified upregulation of the Aldo-keto reductase (AKR) family of genes. This upregulation was confirmed by qRT-PCR and by immunoblot demonstrating that AKRs were upregulated at both the transcriptomic and protein level. We further quantified the AKR levels in the remainder of the 10 cell lines and found that many of the more resistant lines had high expression of AKR1C2. However, not all of the resistant lines had high expression which could be because they have a separate mechanism of resistance to elraglusib. A large body of literature has found that AKR genes provide resistance to many other small molecule inhibitors either by direct metabolism or by indirectly relieving oxidative stress. Given these results, we identify aldo-keto reductases as potentially associated with elraglusib resistance, but further investigation is warranted to establish a causal link between AKR and the resistant phenotype.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Taylor Weiskittel<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ding Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Lingling Han<sup>1<\/sup>, Joseph McDermott<sup>2<\/sup>, Benedito Caneiro<sup>3<\/sup>, Hu Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Daniel Billadeau<sup>1<\/sup>, Andrew Mazar<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN,<sup>2<\/sup>Latern Pharma Inc., Dallas, TX,<sup>3<\/sup>Brown University, Providence, RI,<sup>4<\/sup>Actuate Therapeutics Inc., Forth Worth, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"aaf6ecf6-8e29-4740-a4c3-bc7f6eb3f09e","ControlNumber":"6846","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

For the latter, molecular characterization has defined tumor subsets with discrete driver alterations sensitive to targeted inhibitors, leading to significant improvement in patient survival. However, for LUSCs, to date no specific drivers have been described that are amenable for pharmacological targeting and no targeted therapies are approved for use in this setting. Despite decades of research, LUSCs are still treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy, and now concomitant immunotherapy, which does not achieve durable responses in most patients. Thus, identification of targetable vulnerabilities in this setting remains a critical unmet clinical need. Preliminary data from our lab has identified the nuclear exporter exportin 1 as a therapeutic vulnerability in small cell lung carcinomas. Exportin 1 (XPO1) inhibition with Selinexor, a drug approved for clinical use in the setting of hematological malignancies, induces significant sensitivity in combination with cisplatin and irinotecan. Here, we explored the role of XPO1 as a therapeutic target in LUSC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b><b> <\/b>We performed a comprehensive multi-omic molecular characterization of a library of LUSC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) (N=28, with 17 clinical samples being matched pairs). IHC, RNA-seq and NGS via MSK-IMPACT were performed on 27 samples. To examine the potential of XPO1 inhibition as sensitizer to chemotherapy in LUSC, we performed genetic and pharmacological inhibition experiments in LUSC cell lines exhibiting high XPO1 expression.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Of the 28 models, 19 samples (68%) were from primary tumors and 9 samples (32%) from metastasis. The sample set were roughly split in half with regard to treatment status; 15 samples (54%) were treatment na&#239;ve and 13 sample were treated (46%).XPO1 is highly expressed in LUSCs clinical specimens compared to other tumor types, and its knockdown reduces tumorigenic features of LUSC cell lines with high XPO1 expression, including proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. Targeted XPO1 inhibition with selinexor induces chemotherapy sensitization to carboplatin and paclitaxel, drugs currently used in the treatment of LUSC, as depicted by high cytotoxic synergy scores of selinexor with either drug.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Our data suggest that XPO1 expression may exert pro-oncogenic effects in LUSC, consistent with its upregulation in this tumor setting, and that its inhibition with selinexor may strongly sensitize to chemotherapy. Assessment of efficacy of combination therapies with selinexor <i>in vivo<\/i> will assess the potential of these combinations as a therapeutic approach for LUSC tumors. The clinical availability of selinexor would allow immediate clinical translation of the results generated in this project.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,Lung cancer,Squamous cell carcinoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Vidushi Durani<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Rebecca Caeser<sup>2<\/sup>, Charles  M.

Although initial success with androgen deprivation therapy and AR-targeted agents such as enzalutamide or abiraterone, most patients inevitably relapse due to therapeutic resistance. Previous studies have shown that genomic AR is unchanged despite resistance to AR antagonists, and its gene expression is unaltered. Therapeutic resistance is broadly classified into two categories; restoration of AR activity and tumor progression despite AR blockade. Indeed, others have noted an extensive reprogramming of the AR cistrome in clinical and preclinical specimens, where a shift in canonical to non-canonical AR cistrome is associated with an increase in Gleason grade. In previous studies, we observed increases in known AR target genes following exposure to kinase inhibitors which was marked by a decrease in tumor growth. We hypothesized that restoration of canonical AR cistrome can be mediated through kinase inhibition and is associated with re-sensitization to AR-targeted therapy. In addition, we treated cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models of advanced prostate cancer with kinase signaling pathway inhibitors, AR signaling inhibitors, or a combination of both for 24 hours (in vitro) or five days (in vivo). In addition, samples were collected and processed for RNA-seq and ChIP-seq. Our transcriptomic analysis showed enrichment of previously published non-canonical AR target genes in cells resistant to AR-targeted agents. When resistant cells were exposed to kinase inhibitors, we observed an enrichment of canonical AR target genes. In addition, we identified unique AR-enriched peaks at active sites associated with resistance. Through GSEA of gene annotated peaks, we found unique regulatory transcription factor targets, some of which are associated with cell proliferation and differentiation and may play a functional role in AR cistrome adaptation to resistance and survival. Overall, our data suggest that AR transcription adapts to the therapeutic resistance of AR antagonists via the enrichment of non-canonical AR cistrome. Furthermore, restoration of canonical AR cistrome is achieved following kinase signaling pathway inhibition and is associated with re-sensitization to AR-targeted therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Remi M.

NRAS-mutant OCI-AML3 and THP1 cells, that are inherently resistant to venetoclax, were sensitized to venetoclax when combined with ERKi with ~90% apoptosis compared to 20% by venetoclax alone (Combination Index = 0.008). Synergy was also confirmed using isogenic OCI-AML2 cells with lab-generated acquired resistance to venetoclax, resulting in 75% apoptosis versus 22% by venetoclax (CI=0.6). Leukemia progenitor cells in primary AML samples were also depleted by the ven+ERKi combination (CI:0.03-0.23). In line with our in-vitro findings, treatment with ASTX029 as a single agent or in combination with venetoclax significantly inhibited leukemia burden and increased survival in an OCIAML3 xenograft model (p&#60;0.05). Single agent ERKi and combination treatment using an NRAS-mutant PDX resulted in significantly impaired clonogenic potential and decreased expression of cMyc and CD44 in CD34+CD38- population as demonstrated by CyTOF, indicating depletion of progenitors. Transcriptomic profiling of OCIAML3 cells revealed upregulation of 6 pathways in response to venetoclax including oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), electron transport chain, Myc targets, E2F targets, epithelial mesenchymal transition and KRAS signaling. Interestingly, these pathways were downregulated after ERKi+venetoclax treatment along with decrease in glycolysis and fatty acid metabolism (FDR&#60;0.05). Since, venetoclax treatment significantly enriched for OXPHOS, we examined the metabolic effect of ERKi to overcome venetoclax resistance. Seahorse analysis showed increased basal and maximal respiration, and ATP production in OCIAML2 venetoclax resistant versus parental cells. Combining ERKi with venetoclax reduced OCR and ATP production in OCIAML3 and OCIAML2-venetoclax resistant cells. This was accompanied by an increase in membrane depolarization (p=0.001) as well as enhanced mitochondrial ROS (p&#60;0.001).<br \/><i>Conclusion:<\/i> The inhibition of ERK1\/2 alters mitochondrial metabolism and functional integrity to overcome resistance to venetoclax by causing apoptosis in venetoclax resistant AML cells.

Interestingly, combined inhibition of MEK1\/2 (with trametinib, T) plus autophagy (with chloroquine, CQ, or hydroxychloroquine, HCQ) demonstrated striking anti-tumor effects in preclinical models and in a patient (Patient 1). However, not all patients respond to the T\/HCQ regimen, and Patient 1 eventually developed resistant disease. Here we report that primary or acquired resistance is associated with focal DNA copy number gains encompassing <i>c-MYC<\/i>. Furthermore, ectopic expression of c-MYC in PDA cell lines rendered them T\/HCQ resistant. Interestingly, a CDK4\/6 inhibitor, palbociclib (P), also induced autophagy and overrode c-MYC-mediated T\/HCQ resistance, such that P\/HCQ promoted regression of T\/HCQ resistant PDA tumors with elevated c-MYC expression. Finally, P\/HCQ treatment of Patient 1 resulted in a biochemical disease response. These data suggest that elevated c-MYC expression is both a marker and a mediator of T\/HCQ resistance, which may be overcome by the use of palbociclib plus hydroxychloroquine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myc,Pancreatic cancer,Autophagy,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Mark Silvis<sup><\/sup>, Dilru Silva<sup><\/sup>, Rohweder Riley<sup><\/sup>, Sophia Schuman<sup><\/sup>, Swapna Gudipaty<sup><\/sup>, Amanda Truong<sup><\/sup>, Jeffery Yap<sup><\/sup>, Kajsa Affolter<sup><\/sup>, Martin McMahon<sup><\/sup>, <b>Conan Kinsey<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Utah Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5505cfda-769b-475a-85e7-a34b62be6cdc","ControlNumber":"7830","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Olaparib (Lynparza) was among the first PARP inhibitors (PARPi) approved for the treatment of CRPC tumors harboring DNA repair defects. However, clinical resistance to PARPi&#8217;s has been documented. The mechanisms underlying resistance to PARPi&#8217;s remain elusive. To study acquired resistance, we developed olaparib-resistant LN-OlapR and 2B-OlapR cell lines generated through chronic olaparib treatment of the olaparib-sensitive cell lines LNCaP and C4-2B, respectively. RNA-seq revealed IGFBP3 is overexpressed in both OlapR cell lines. IGFBP3 overexpression is correlated with poor clinical outcome and is thought to participate in DNA repair pathways. IGFBP3 plays a key role in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair through a ternary complex with EGFR and DNA-PKcs. The IGFBP3\/EGFR signaling axis is thought to modulate NHEJ repair and could have implications for PARPi sensitivity. We hypothesize that increased IGFBP3 expression promotes PARPi resistance by enhancing DNA repair capacity.<br \/>Methods: RNA-sequencing and gene set enrichment analysis were used to determine the expression profile changes in resistant cells compared to parental cells. Real time PCR and western blots confirmed the expression of DNA damage repair genes such as &#947;H2AX, EGFR, and DNA-PKcs. ELISA was used to determine IGFBP3 secretion. RNAi was used to inhibit IGFBP3 and EGFR expression. Gefitinib was used to inhibit EGFR activity. Cell viability assays were used to assess cell growth.<br \/>Results: Transcriptomic profiling revealed that IGFBP3 is highly expressed in resistant models. We verified increased levels of IGFBP3 RNA and protein in both OlapR models. We found that RNAi inhibition of IGFBP3 increases &#947;H2AX and cleaved-PARP protein levels in the resistant models, which suggests accumulation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) leading to genomic instability and cell death. We discovered increased phosphorylation of EGFR and DNA-PKcs in the resistant cells. Furthermore, silencing\/inhibiting IGFBP3 and EGFR reduces OlapR cell viability and resensitizes resistant cells to treatment.<br \/>Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that inhibiting IGFBP3 and EGFR aids in PARPi sensitivity in the resistant setting. Future work will utilize OlapR models to study how the IGFBP3\/EGFR\/DNA-PKcs protein complex promotes the development of resistance. Understanding the role of IGFBP3 in PARPi resistance will enhance our ability to re-sensitize resistant CRPC to PARPi therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP inhibitors,Resistance,DNA damage response,DNA double-strand break,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Amy  R.

However, up to 30% of these patients will experience relapse due in part to aromatase inhibitor resistance. We recently identified miR125b2-3p as a putative tumor suppressor in HR+ breast cancer. We also found that small molecule Aminoflavone (AF) induces miR125b2-3p expression in HR+ breast cancer cells. In the current study, we hypothesized that AF confers anticancer actions in breast cancer cells resistant to aromatase inhibitors via miR125b2-3p reactivation. Using the Alamar Blue and colony forming assays, we discovered that AF demonstrated anticancer activity in estrogen-deprived resistant (EDR) cells designed to mimic aromatase inhibitor resistance. AntagomiR125b2-3p enhanced, while miR125b2-3p mimics diminished colony formation of EDR cells. AF-mediated suppression of colony formation in EDR cells was attenuated during co-treatment with antagomiR125b2-3p and was enhanced during co-treatment with miR125b2-3p mimics. Both miR125b2-3p mimics and AF suppressed EDR cell migration. AntagomiR125b2-3p counteracted AF-mediated suppression of cell migration. Our in silico profiling studies identified the alpha6-integrin, a mediator of breast cancer stem cell activity and metastasis, as one miR-125b2-3p target. Immunohistochemistry of patient tumor samples revealed that alpha 6-integrin protein expression intensified following relapse on the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole. MCF-7 cells transfected to overexpress the alpha 6-integrin were less responsive to anastrozole than those transfected with empty vector. These data suggest that AF restores the tumor suppressor function of miR125b2-3p to inhibit the alpha 6-integrin and confer activity against aromatase inhibitor-resistant breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Resistance,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Eileen J.

The evolution of tumor cells with acquired resistance to targeted agents initially involves the persistence of a drug-tolerant subpopulation of tumor cells which display a transient and flexible resistant state. These persister cells can remain quiescent for prolonged periods of time, but eventually give rise to fully drug resistant tumor cells that resume growth and metastatic spread. The signaling pathways that allow persister cells to remain viable or to re-activate expansive growth are poorly understood. We and others have reported that EGFR TKI resistance that occurs independent of secondary EGFR mutations or MET amplification is associated with an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Our analysis of tumor cells that had undergone EMT-mediated resistance to the EGFR TKI osimertinib revealed that interleukin-6 (IL-6) was highly upregulated in resistant cells as compared to parental cells. We find that in the setting of EGFR mutant NSCLC, IL-6 suppresses the anti-tumor cell activity of T cells and NK cells. To assess the role of IL-6 in the early events of EGFR TKI resistance, we generated drug-tolerant persister cells by treating EGFR mutant HCC4006 and HCC827 NSCLC cells with the EGFR TKI osimertinib for 10 days and then assessed IL-6 expression. We observed that IL-6 was upregulated at both the RNA and protein levels in EGFR-TKI persister cells as compared to parental cells. While the cell surface expression of IL6R was not significantly increased in EGFR-TKI persister cells as compared to parental cells, we observed increased secretion of soluble IL6R in persister cells by ELISA assay. We next assessed changes in protein expression and activation in drug tolerant persister cells by reverse phase protein array (RPPA) and observed that p-STAT3, a key component of the IL-6 signaling pathway, was significantly elevated in persister cells as compared parental cells or cells treated with osimertinib for 24 hours. Using genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of EGFR<sup>L858R<\/sup> mutant lung cancer, we also observed a similar upregulation of both IL-6 and p-STAT3 expression at the RNA and protein levels in EGFR-mutant tumors treated with osimertinib for 2 or 4 weeks. Additionally, circulating levels of IL-6 also are elevated in EGFR<sup>L858R <\/sup>GEMMs treated with osimertinib for 2 or 4 weeks. Collectively, our data indicates that upregulation of IL-6 is an early event in the evolution of drug resistance. Given the role of IL-6 in promoting EGFR TKI resistance, further studies investigating whether targeting of IL-6 signaling may impair the survival or outgrowth of persister populations are warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-6,Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI),Drug resistance,STAT3 activation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sonia  A.

We previously showed that BRAF-driven melanoma cells treated with BRAF inhibitors can non-genetically adapt to drug within 3-4 days to escape quiescence and resume slow proliferation. Here we show that this phenomenon is not unique to melanomas treated with BRAF inhibitors but rather is widespread across many clinical MAPK inhibitors and cancer types driven by EGFR, KRAS, and BRAF mutations. In all treatment contexts examined, a subset of cells can escape drug-induced quiescence within four days to resume proliferation. These escapee cells broadly experience aberrant DNA replication, accumulate DNA lesions, spend longer in G2-M cell cycle phases, and mount an ATR-dependent stress response. We further identify the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway as critical for successful mitotic completion in escapees. Long-term cultures, patient samples, and clinical data demonstrate a broad dependency on ATR- and FA-mediated stress tolerance. Together, these results highlight the pervasiveness with which MAPK-mutant cancers are able to rapidly escape drug and the importance of suppressing early stress tolerance pathways to potentially achieve more durable clinical responses to targeted MAPK pathway inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Cell proliferation,DNA damage,Cell death,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Timothy  E.

Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK), c-Met, is overexpressed and hyperactivated in renal cancer; and it promotes tumor-promoting pathways following binding with its ligand, Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF). Cabozantinib (Cabo), an inhibitor of c-Met\/few other RTKs (like, AXL and KDR), is being used for the treatment of RCC. However, acquired therapeutic resistance is a major hurdle in its clinical use. Mechanism(s) of drug resistance against c-Met inhibition is largely unknown. Although Cabo (XL184) can effectively inhibit c-Met\/RTK phosphorylation, very interestingly, we found that, prolonged treatment of Cabozantinib (24 hours, <i>in vitro<\/i>) increased the expression of total c-Met and AXL in renal cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. AXL is also overexpressed in RCC and has a novel cross-talk with c-Met. We found that silencing AXL (either by gene knock-down approach or using a specific inhibitor (TP-0903)) markedly down-regulates Cabo-mediated total c-Met expression and enhances apoptosis of<i> <\/i>human RCC cells<i>. <\/i>We have also utilized murine model(s) of renal cancer growth (both xenograft and syngeneic), and found that Cabo treatment increases the levels of c-Met and AXL in tumor tissues,<i> <\/i>and the inhibition of AXL using TP-0903 can markedly inhibit the expression levels of total c-Met and AXL. We observed that HGF-mediated c-Met phosphorylation is short-lived when AXL is silenced. We also found that a lower concentration of Cabo can mediate cancer cell survival; and either the knock-down of AXL or using AXL inhibitor in combination with Cabo can reverse these effects. We have studied the downstream signaling pathways (Akt, ERK1\/2 and STAT3) of c-Met, and found that AXL inhibition is crucial to down-regulate c-Met-induced signaling molecules following Cabo treatment. Our observations indicate that Cabo-mediated increase in total c-Met in RCC cells is not regulated at the transcriptional level; however, Cabo can interfere with the receptor degradation pathway leading to increased accumulation of c-Met. We have also studied the levels of c-Met and AXL in renal tumor tissues (archived specimens) from renal cancer patients before and after Cabozantinib treatment. Interestingly, we found increased levels of total c-Met and AXL in tumor tissues following Cabo treatment. Together our data suggest that AXL plays a critical role in mediating therapeutic resistance against c-Met inhibitor; and a combination of Cabo and an AXL\/other RTK inhibitor can effectively block the resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI),Renal cell carcinoma,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Akash Sabarwal<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Laxminarayan Rawat<sup>1<\/sup>, Johannes Wedel<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuzuru Sasamoto<sup>1<\/sup>, Sabina Signoretti<sup>2<\/sup>, Toni K.

However, not all patients respond (sotorasib - ORR = 37.1%, adagrasib - 43%, JDQ443 - 35%), motivating preclinical and clinical investigation into mechanisms of intrinsic and acquired resistance. For instance, clinical studies have reported on-target KRAS mutations and preclinical studies have demonstrated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) feedback reactivation including EGFP, SHP2, and WT RAS signaling. In response to targeted therapies, sub-populations of cells can enter quiescence or specific epigenetic-driven states that confer drug tolerance. However, epigenetic states defining drug-tolerant persister populations and contributing to adaptive resistance to KRAS G12Ci have not been reported. Using a lineage tracing barcoded system, we identify distinct and reversible subpopulations defined by specific chromatin and transcriptional states in KRAS NSCLC cell lines that contribute to KRAS G12Ci resistance <i>in vitro<\/i>, even prior to drug treatment. We observed that specific states, including activation of histone demethylation and SWI\/SNF complex, may contribute to MAPK reactivation-driven resistance. These results suggest potential epigenetic vulnerabilities that can be exploited to improve the response to KRAS G12Ci. Moreover, we observed distinct persister subpopulations with resistance to KRAS G12Ci combination co-targeting orthogonal pathways (SHP2, CDK4\/6, PI3K, and MCL-1), raising the possibility that distinct epigenetic-transcriptional states contribute to differential drug response and clonal evolution of persisters. Collectively, these results suggest that more complete tumor regression may be achieved by orthogonal strategies that target different resistant populations within the same tumor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Resistance,Epigenomics,Chromatin remodeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chendi Li<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Qian Qin<sup>1<\/sup>, Mohammed Usman Syed<sup>1<\/sup>, Anahita Nimbalkar<sup>1<\/sup>, Barbara Karakyriakou<sup>1<\/sup>, Sarah  E.

In response to KRAS G12C inhibitor (G12Ci), KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells maintain a drug-tolerant state by aurora kinase A (AURKA). AURKA can phosphorylate c-Raf to maintain new KRAS signaling, however, how AURKA becomes activated to cause KRAS G12Ci resistance is unclear. We show here that KRAS G12C + AURKA inhibition cause synthetic lethality in KRAS G12C NSCLC cells. LY3499446 (KRAS G12Ci) and LSN3321213 (aurora kinase A inhibitor) induced apoptosis that is independent of inhibited MAPK reactivation. Using high-content imaging that tracks single-cell fate during treatment, we observed that single-agent KRAS G12Ci induces G1 arrest in a sub-population of cells. Upon co-treatment with G12C + AURKAi, cells that are halted in G1 phase undergo early apoptosis, while those that initially evade G1 arrest and proceed through G2\/M undergo apoptosis in subsequent G1. These data suggest the hypothesis that AURKA inhibition may increase the probability of G1 checkpoint-induced apoptosis by facilitating chromosomal misalignment and genomic instability. In summary, we provide clinical rationale for clinical testing of KRAS G12C + AURKA inhibitors. We also suggest a novel mechanism explaining the dependency of KRAS G12C resistant subpopulations on AURKA, leading to the opportunity to investigate the role of genomic instability in conferring KRAS G12Ci adaptive resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Resistance,Aurora kinase,Chromosomal instability,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chendi Li<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jeremy Chang<sup>2<\/sup>, Mohammed  U.

However, whether duration of clinical treatment might elicit specific mechanism(s) of CDK4\/6i resistance is unclear. To better understand if duration of clinical treatment correlates with unique resistance mechanisms, we established, characterized, and compared a panel of ER+ breast XPDX models from patients who benefitted then progressed on a CDK4\/6i. Patients were separated into two groups by time to progression (TTP): those who responded up to twelve months (RES12) and patients with clinical response greater than one year (RES13+).<br \/>Methods: Seventeen breast cancer XPDX models were analyzed, including eight previously described (7xRES12; 1xRES13+: SABCS2021: T Hernandez et al). Nine new models were established from seven patients: six from fluid samples with three designated as ductal (ST3105B, ST3105C, STM001B) and three lobular carcinoma (STM182, STM229, STM229B); two from lymph node biopsies (ST5676, STM127) and one from a liver core biopsy (ST4887B), all reported as ductal carcinoma. STM182 was classified as RES12 and the remaining eight as RES13+. These models were passaged and challenged with CDK4\/6i to confirm resistance. Receptor expression was determined by IHC and genomic analyses including WES and RNA<sub>seq<\/sub>, were performed to identify mechanisms of resistance. For in vivo studies, CDK4\/6i were dosed PO once daily at 50 mg\/kg; endpoints included tumor volume (TV) and time from treatment initiation (TTI) with %T\/C values and tumor regression reported at study completion; a %T\/C of &#8804;20 versus control was considered sensitive. Tumor regression (%T\/C&#60;0) versus Day 0 TV was also reported.<br \/>Results: Clinical TTP for RES12 (n=8) was four to twelve months and RES13+ (n=9) from thirteen to forty-two months. All models retained ER expression in evaluated passages with similar histology compared with archival clinical samples. Sequencing identified several variants including RB1 truncations or deletions and increased gene expression in CCND1, CCNE1 and the PIK3CA\/AKT pathway. Interestingly, 5\/8 RES12 models reported ESR1 mutations or fusions versus 1\/9 RES13+ and PIK3CA mutations were reported in 1\/8 RES12 versus 5\/9 RES13+. Several RES13+ models also reported variants and increased amplification in the RICTOR\/TORC2 pathway versus RES12.<br \/>Conclusion: We have established, characterized, and compared a panel of seventeen breast XPDX models from fourteen female patients representing early or late acquired resistance to CDK4\/6i therapy and identified potential differences in each set.

To identify novel, effective therapeutic strategies, we investigated the impact of MEK and ERK inhibitors on production of inflammatory cytokines in PDAC cells. We found that both MEK and ERK inhibitors dramatically upregulated production of TNF, leading to activation of multiple TNF signaling pathways which include the pro-death and pro-survival NF-kB and p38.MK2 cascades. Silencing of TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) abrogated the pro-apoptotic effect of MAPK inhibitors, suggesting that pro-death effect driven by TNF signaling is required for the therapeutic effect of MAPK inhibitors. However, targeting the NF-kB and MK2 pathways greatly augment the suppressive effect of MAPK inhibitors. Notably, the mechanisms via which MK2 promotes PDAC cell survival are mediated through phospho-activation of Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) and Beclin1, a critical mediator of autophagy. Intriguingly, silencing of TNFR1 abrogated induction of proactive autophagy following MAPK inhibition, strongly suggesting autocrine signaling as the inciting event of autophagy. Mechanistically, we showed that TNF signaling upregulate unfolded protein response (UPR) in PDAC cells, which is required for autophagy induction. Targeting MK2 abrogated transcription of key UPR genes and blocks subsequent autophagy. The combination of MK2 inhibitor ATI-450 and ERK inhibitor ulixertinib was more effective in curbing the growth of PDAC patient-derived xenograft in vivo and prolonged the survival of autochthonous PDAC mice (KPC model). Overall, our study provided novel insights on the mechanisms that drive protective autophagy following MAPK pathway inhibition and a rationale and feasible therapeutic combination that can be tested in clinical trials for PDAC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular-regulated kinase 1\/2,Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,Tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF-&#945;),Autophagy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Iftikhar Ali Khawar<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Qing Wei<sup><\/sup>, Timothy Hung-Po Chen<sup><\/sup>, Lin Lin<sup><\/sup>, Patrick  M.

Acquired resistance due to genomic alterations following sotorasib treatment has been observed in 28% of lung cancer patients (CodeBreaK100, ASCO 2022) and can include bypass signaling, inactivation of negative feedback loops, or compensatory mutations in KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> including amplification of <i>KRAS<\/i>.<br \/>Preclinical studies on the mechanisms of acquired resistance are critical for understanding these resistance patterns and can reveal new therapeutic or combination strategies in the clinic. For that reason, we developed an NCI-H358 lung cancer model of acquired resistance to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibition in vitro. NCI-H358 cells were continuously cultured in the presence of elevated concentrations of sotorasib (IC90) until resistance to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor was achieved. Expression analyses of the resistant cells by ddPCR and immunoblotting showed increases in both KRAS gene and protein levels, resulting in enhanced MAPK signaling. siRNA knockdown of <i>KRAS<\/i> <i>G12C<\/i> expression re-sensitized the resistant cells to an analog of sotorasib. Further characterization of this cell line by whole exome sequencing (WES) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed that resistance was not due to genetic co-alterations but amplification of the mutant allele specifically. In comparison to DMSO-treated and parental controls, the sotorasib-resistant NCI-H358 cells contained an approximately 50-fold increase in <i>KRAS G12C<\/i> mutant allele copy numbers.<br \/>Preclinical data generated using a KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor-resistant lung cancer cell line is consistent with clinical observations of acquired <i>KRAS <\/i>amplification following KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor treatment as a mechanism of resistance.

However, resistance mechanism remains as a major challenge of HER2-targeting therapies. YAP (Yes-associated protein) is a major downstream effector of Hippo pathway, and it plays an essential role in cancer cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. Moreover, YAP is emerging as a key player of resistance mechanism of cytotoxic and targeted drugs. Yap is also an important immunosuppressive molecule as it works as a negative regulator of T cell tumor infiltration. In this study, we intend to elucidate the role of YAP in mechanism of trastuzumab resistance and T cell immune response in HER2-positive cancer cells.<br \/>Methods: We established four trastuzumab-resistant (HR) cell lines (N87HR, SNU216HR, SNU2670HR and SNU2773HR) from HER2-postive gastric and biliary tract cancer cell lines. To inhibit the function of YAP, siRNA and Verteporfin (YAP-TEAD inhibitor) were used. MTT assay, cell cycle analysis, western blot and migration assay were performed to analyze the antitumor effects through YAP downregulation. In order to evaluate immune-modulation by YAP, human PBMC co-culture was used and immune markers were analyzed by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. Mouse xenograft models were established using SNU2773 and SNU2773HR cells.<br \/>Results: We confirmed that the expressions of pYAP and YAP were elevated in HR cells (SNU216HR, SNU2670HR and SNU2773HR) compared to parental cells. Reducing the expressed YAP in HR cells inhibited tumor cell growth and migration and induced apoptosis. Immune suppression markers such as PD-L1, CD155, and galectin-9 were effectively decreased, while CD80, a stimulation marker, was increased by verteporfin treatment. Also, when YAP was decreased, CCL5 and CXCL10, well known CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell recruitment cytokines, were increased. In HR cells treated with siYAP and verteporfin, there was a trend of increasing CD4<sup>+ <\/sup>and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells when co-culture with PBMC. In vivo experiment data showed greater tumor growth inhibition effects with SNU2773HR than SNU2773 xenograft models when treated with verteporfin.<br \/>Conclusion: The expression of YAP is elevated in trastuzumab-resistant (HR) cells and inhibition of YAP shows anti-tumor effects and activation of T cell responses. Collectively, our data suggests that the inhibition of YAP is one of many promising strategies to overcome trastuzumab resistance and T cell regulatory mechanisms in HER2-positive cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Yes-associated protein (YAP),HER2,Resistance,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Ah Rong Nam<sup>1<\/sup>, Jeesun Yoon<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Kyoung-Seok Oh<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jae-Min Kim<sup>3<\/sup>, Ju-Hee Bang<sup>1<\/sup>, Yoojin Jeong<sup>1<\/sup>, Sea Young Choo<sup>1<\/sup>, Hyo Jung Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Su In Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Tae-Yong Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Do-Youn Oh<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>SNU Medicine, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Internal Medicine, SNU Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>SNU Medicine, Integrated Major in Innovative Medical Science, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"fe0168db-8a28-4d48-925b-3c1fd7c8def4","ControlNumber":"4124","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

This paralysis of normal bone marrow function leads to severe decreased immune function and bleeding tendency, and if not treated, it is an acute disease that dies within a few months due to rapid progression of AML. <i>TP53<\/i> mutations occur in 5% to 10% of patients with de-novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with higher frequency in patients with relapsed\/refractory AML. The treatment approach for many years has used combination chemotherapy, with usually an anthracycline and cytarabine as the foundation. These induction therapy's complete response is achieved in 60 to 85% of adults who are 60 years of age or younger. In patients who are older than 60 years of age, complete response rates are inferior 40 to 60%. <i>TP53<\/i> mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) responds poorly to the conventional induction therapy and has a short overall survival rate with a median of 5-9 months. Poor outcomes in <i>TP53<\/i> mutated AML following chemotherapy have been observed and treatment options remain limited. Therefore, this study attempted to explore the drug candidates for effective treatment of <i>TP53<\/i> mutated AML. To study the cellular response to <i>TP53<\/i>-targeted therapy, we used the human AML cell line Kasumi-1, which harbors a homozygous <i>TP53<\/i> mutation. We treated Kasumi-1 cells with cytarabine and Idarubicin combi-treatment. And we produced Drug Tolerant Persisters (DTPs) which is a minor population of cancer cells may evade cell death from chemotherapy and targeted therapy by entering a reversible slow proliferation state. Similar to a previously described DTP phenotype the DTPs that survive cytarabine and Idarubicin combi-treatment displayed cell-cycle arrest and resistance to further cytarabine and Idarubicin combi-treatment. And we selected 125 drug candidates that would be effective for <i>TP53<\/i> mutated AML through in silico analysis and therapy strategies targeting p53. The drug candidates are composed of Compounds with the ability to reactivate mutant p53, Compounds directly target mutant p53, Synthetic lethal partners with mutant p53, and Compounds with the ability to anti-Leukemic Stem Cell and antineoplastic. We single out 46 of the 125 compounds for functional validation in DTPs. We chose these compounds because many of them are similar subtypes, suggesting they may have a common effect and mechanism. Using in vitro Cytotoxicity assay, we screened 46 candidate compounds at multiple doses and confirmed several drugs that effectively eliminate DTPs. Collectively, our study indicates that the combination of conventional drug and validated drug has the potential to eliminate DTPs and therefore prevent minimal residual disease, mutational drug resistance, and relapse in <i>TP53<\/i>-mutant AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Acute myeloid leukemia,TP53,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Daehyeon Gwak<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Dong Chan Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Heejun Jang<sup>1<\/sup>, Jun Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Ja Min Byun<sup>2<\/sup>, Junshik Hong<sup>2<\/sup>, Dong Yeop Shin<sup>2<\/sup>, Sung-Soo Yoon<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"248a2cd9-650e-42e2-8607-d0bf8a0b5470","ControlNumber":"5731","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

HER2-directed TKIs are highly effective therapies for pts with HER2+ MBC; however, an understanding of resistance mechanisms is needed. Pts receiving HER2-directed TKIs with cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sampling across the treatment spectrum present a unique opportunity to examine genomic alterations.<br \/><b>Methods.<\/b> Pts with biopsy-proven HER2+ MBC were selected from DF\/HCC approved protocols for ultra-low pass whole genome sequencing if &#8805;1 cfDNA and\/or tissue sample had been collected prior to and after at least six weeks of TKI treatment. Only pts with &#8805; 1 sample with tumor fraction (TFx) &#8805; 9.5% and &#8805; 1 additional sample with TFx &#8805; 4.5% were analyzed. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 19 tumor biopsies and 64 cfDNA samples from 25 pts. WES samples were analyzed, variants called and annotated, copy number profiles inferred, and TFx estimated. <i>PhylogicNDT<\/i> was used to detect the phylogenetic architecture, and clones were identified as growing, stable, shrinking, or truncal; mutational signatures were called using <i>SignatureAnalyzer<\/i>. After filtering likely benign variants, mutations were labeled likely resistance mechanisms if there was known evidence of resistance to anti-HER2 therapy in a human breast cancer cell line, breast cancer mouse models, or in vivo. Findings were correlated with pt clinicopathologic data.<br \/><b>Results.<\/b> In 4\/8 pts with acquired resistance (TKI treatment &#8805; 180 days), we identified alterations in previously characterized pathways and genes that could explain treatment resistance (e.g. <i>PIK3CA, ERBB2, FGFR2).<\/i> Mutations in growing subclones identified potential novel mechanisms of resistance and included inactivating mutations in <i>CDK12<\/i>, <i>KMT2D<\/i>, <i>KMT2C<\/i>, <i>CHEK2<\/i>, <i>BRCA2<\/i>, and <i>FAT1<\/i> genes. In 7\/17 pts with intrinsic resistance, we identified mutations in overlapping pathways and genes such as <i>ERBB2<\/i> and <i>PIK3CA, <\/i>which were present in both growing subclonal and truncal clones. Four pts with hormone receptor positive disease - two of whom had not received prior aromatase inhibitors - had an activating <i>ESR1<\/i> hotspot mutation (D538G). This raises the possibility that activating <i>ESR1<\/i> mutations may be involved in resistance in these cases. Mutational signature analysis revealed a subset of samples with widespread APOBEC activation (with and without hyper mutation), subclonal HR\/MMR-related signature, and capecitabine-related 5FU signature.<br \/><b>Conclusions.<\/b> Genomic analysis of paired samples from pts with HER2+ MBC identifies candidate resistance mechanisms to anti-HER2 TKIs and clonal evolution over time in the context of heterogeneity in treatment and sample timing.

The discovery of activating mutations in ER (gene name ESR1), in patients with advanced endocrine-resistant ER+ breast cancer, has ignited a large pharmaceutical effort to develop next-generation ER antagonists that also target the mutant protein. Here, we profiled the potency and selectivity of many next-generation ER antagonists currently in clinical trials, including ER-targeted proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), selective ER modulators (SERMs), and selective ER degraders (SERDs). To contextualize these antagonists, we evaluated their activity against the only FDA-approved SERD, Fulvestrant, at the level of chromatin, transcriptome, proteome, and cell viability, using cells expressing wild-type ER as well as activating mutant ER (ER<sup>Y537S<\/sup> and ER<sup>D538G<\/sup>). Overall, we find that many of the novel oral SERDs are potent ER antagonists, including against mutant ER. To anticipate resistance mechanisms to these next-generation ER antagonists, we developed a strategy initially focused on ARV471 (the most clinically advanced ER PROTAC), with two approaches. First, we performed whole-genome CRISPR\/Cas9-knockout screening in ER+ breast cancer cell lines treated with ARV471. Among the enriched gRNAs were PTEN, NF2, and CRBN. Loss of PTEN and NF2 results in activation of the PI3K and MAPK pathways, respectively, and CRBN is the ubiquitin E3 ligase required for ER protein degradation by ARV471. PTEN and NF2 are known mechanisms of endocrine resistance but it is not yet known if CRBN loss in response to PROTACs is a predominant clinical resistance mechanism. Therefore, in a second approach we generated ARV471 resistant breast cancer cell lines through long term exposure (LTE-ARV471). These cells developed an ER-independent resistance mechanism, with decreased ER expression and increased expression of pathways associated with Ras\/MAPK and EMT. Therefore, as more potent ER degraders enter the clinic, such as PROTACs and oral SERDs, it may be important to monitor resistance mechanisms that involve loss of ER. Currently, we are following up our findings with LTE-ARV471 cells and performing CRISPR screening to identify targetable dependencies and combination therapies for endocrine resistant breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endocrine resistance,Breast cancer,Proteasome-mediated degradation,Estrogen receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Delia Margaret Friel<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Zachary Sandusky<sup>1<\/sup>, Yijia Jiang<sup>2<\/sup>, Xintao Qiu<sup>2<\/sup>, Rong Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Henry Long<sup>1<\/sup>, Rinath Jeselsohn<sup>1<\/sup>, Myles Brown<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Medical Oncology, DFCI\/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Center for Functional Cancer Epigenetics, DFCI\/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"82ac9a23-7456-4790-8109-ad108b0bc532","ControlNumber":"7941","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

However, sporadic ERK reactivation occurs in melanoma models, and efficacy is severely limited by the emergence of drug resistance. The underlying molecular mechanisms that drive ERK reactivation and adaptation to BRAFi\/MEKi remain elusive. Here, using single-cell imaging and optogenetic approaches, we show that the strength and duration of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation determines ERK reactivation and the development of BRAFi\/MEKi-resistant cells. Single-cell data reveal that despite global RTK activation by the same external stimuli, only small subsets of melanoma cells induce effective RTK and ERK activation to develop BRAFi\/MEKi resistance. Furthermore, by directly controlling RTK activity, we demonstrate that the kinetics of RTK activation determine ERK signaling dynamics and the percentage of drug-resistant cells. While these drug-resistant cells are rare during early stages of drug treatment, they eventually become the dominant population through sustained RTK-mediated ERK activation that drives cell proliferation. Thus, RTK activation in established drug-resistant cells causes effective ERK activation and cell proliferation. Importantly, limiting RTK signaling activation reverses the BRAFi\/MEKi-resistant state. We show that targeting SHP2, a mediator of RTK signaling, effectively suppresses RTK-mediated ERK activation and cell proliferation in BRAFi\/MEKi-resistant cells. Our results provide mechanistic insights into the contribution of heterogeneity in RTK activation kinetics to ERK reactivation and BRAFi\/MEKi resistance, also highlighting SHP2 activity as a promising target to overcome drug resistance in <i>BRAF<\/i>-mutant melanoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ERK,BRAF\/MEK inhibitors,Resistance,Optogenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sungsoo Kim<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Richard Carvajal<sup><\/sup>, Minah Kim<sup><\/sup>, Hee Won Yang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"51fac001-eb45-4a67-ab5b-64f49add0a41","ControlNumber":"625","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

However, endocrine resistance is ubiquitous in late-stage metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The chief mechanism is the acquisition of ER mutations (ERmuts) in 25% of endocrine-resistant tumors; ERmuts are strongly resistant to aromatase inhibitor (AI) endocrine therapy. We previously identified four novel acquired activating mutations in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) by whole exome sequencing (WES) of paired ER+ MBC in a clinical cohort. These HER2 mutations (HER2muts) were enriched in multiple resistant tumors, and like ERmuts, were resistant to AIs. In contrast to ERmuts, these HER2muts also conferred complete resistance to all other classes of endocrine therapy, as well as cross-resistance to combination therapy with cyclin-dependent kinase 4\/6 (CDK4\/6) inhibitors; the latter is standard-of-care in the refractory setting in ER+ MBC. At the same time, these HER2muts had variable responses to HER2-targeting therapies used in HER2+ breast cancer. Thus, HER2muts represent only the second validated mechanism of clinical endocrine resistance in ER+ MBC, accounting for ~8% of cases, and that is therapeutically intractable. Systematic phenotypic characterization of HER2muts in ER+ MBC is a prerequisite for effective targeting of this class of resistance. We used cBioPortal to identify &#62;20 novel HER2 variants of unknown significance (VUS) that were frequent pan-cancer, in ER+ breast tumors, or annotated in a domain-restricted HER2 saturation mutagenesis screen, and that had not been previously characterized in ER+ MBC. We also identified a novel HER2 VUS by WES in an ER+\/HER2+ tumor with resistance to HER2 therapy, from a clinical cohort of breast cancer patients. We phenotypically characterized all VUS through clinically comprehensive targeted therapy viability assays, and downstream activation assays. In sum, we identified seven novel activating HER2muts, spanning domains, with clinically important phenotypes in ER+ MBC. We found these HER2muts also conferred complete resistance to all classes of endocrine therapies, and cross-resistance to CDK4\/6 inhibition. While novel HER2muts had variable responses to HER2-targeting therapies, they could be endocrine re-sensitized by combination with an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Lastly, we report that constitutive HER2 homodimerization via reduction-sensitive disulfide bridges that occur as a consequence of mutations in the extracellular and juxtamembrane domains is a more common mechanism of HER2 hyperactivation than previously appreciated. This finding has unique functional consequences, and provides important structure-function insight into HER2 biology, beyond its immediate clinical ramifications in ER+ MBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endocrine resistance,HER2\/neu,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Nelson Vicente Guevara<sup>1<\/sup>, Zirui Zhu<sup>1<\/sup>, Esha Jain<sup>2<\/sup>, Jennifer Kavran<sup>1<\/sup>, Selime Arslan<sup>1<\/sup>, Nikhil Wagle<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Utthara Nayar<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD,<sup>2<\/sup>Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0cc36e38-65c8-4525-b3b7-5da3403dca59","ControlNumber":"2890","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

However, BRAF and KRAS mutant NSCLC cells with co-occurring mutations in STK11 were resistant to BET and RAS, RAF or MEK co-inhibition. To unravel the underlying mechanism of resistance to BET and RAS-MAPK inhibitors upon STK11 loss we modeled STK11 deficiency in BRAF and KRAS mutant NSCLC cells and tumors. We found that STK11 loss creates an unprecedented dependence on YAP\/TEAD TFs. STK11 silencing in BRAF and KRAS mutant NSCLC cells resulted in nuclear transfer\/ activation of the HIPPO pathway effector, YAP, upregulation of the YAP target BIRC5 (aka Survivin) and rescued the synthetic lethality due to BET and RAS, RAF or MEK co-inhibition. Phenocopying STK11 loss, constitutively active YAP (YAP5SA), but not transcriptionally inactive YAP (YAPS94A), mitigated the deleterious effects of BET and RAS, RAF or MEK co-suppression in BRAF and KRAS mutant NSCLC cells with potent upregulation of the pro-survival factor BIRC5. Conversely, we found that co-silencing YAP or TEADs with BETs re-sensitized BRAF and KRAS mutant NSCLC cells with co-occurring mutations in STK11 to BET and RAS-MAPK inhibitors combination and caused synthetic lethality.<br \/>Conclusion: This study uncovered a functional interaction between BET proteins, STK11, HIPPO-YAP and RAS-MAPK signaling pathways in lung cancer.

They bind to the cereblon (CRBN) component of the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and designate a new set of substrates for proteasomal degradation. Most patients initially respond well to IMiD\/CELMoD therapy but over time will become resistant. Understanding resistance mechanisms will enable the development of new targeted treatment strategies to overcome this pressing clinical challenge.<br \/>Acquired IMiD\/CELMoD resistant human MM cell lines were generated by treating IMiD\/CELMoD sensitive MM1s and H929 cells with lenalidomide (Len), pomalidomide (Pom) or iberdomide (Iber) at ~10x GI50 concentration for ~12 weeks until resistance was achieved. Cell lines were characterized by whole exome sequencing, RNA-Seq and proteomics. All resistant lines had reduced CRBN expression and some had <i>CRBN<\/i> mutations, reflecting patient data.<br \/>A genome-wide loss-of-function CRISPR screen (Brunello library) was carried out in Iber-resistant MM1s. Gene effect scores were calculated with the Chronos algorithm and compared to parental MM1s using data from the Broad Institute DepMap portal. Potential new dependencies in the resistant setting (defined as gene effect score &#60;-1 in resistant cells and &#62;-0.5 in parental cells) were identified in 47 genes including SETD2, a histone 3 lysine 36 methyltransferase (H3K36me2 -&#62; H3K36me3).<br \/>The specific SETD2 inhibitor EPZ-719 reduced viability to a greater extent in the IMiD\/CELMoD resistant lines compared to their controls in a 14-day trypan blue exclusion assay. This was most pronounced in the Pom- and Iber-resistant H929 lines. For example in Iber-resistant H929 compared to its control line the viability with EPZ-719 was 13% vs 66% at 1&#181;M, 5% vs 46% at 5&#181;M and 2% vs 45% at 10&#181;M, p&#60;0.0001 (% viability compared to DMSO control at day 14).<br \/>To investigate whether this novel dependency was related to reduced CRBN expression a <i>CRBN<\/i> knockout MM1s cell line was generated using CRISPR\/Cas9. These cells showed a markedly greater reduction in viability with EPZ-719 compared to control MM1s (viability 20% vs 32% at 1&#181;M, 8% vs 25% at 5&#181;M and 2% vs 18% at 10&#181;M, p&#60;0.001).<br \/>A reduction in H3K36me3 was seen on immunoblotting after EPZ-719 incubation across all cell lines suggesting an on-target effect. ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq experiments are underway to identify downstream mechanisms.<br \/>In conclusion, SETD2 inhibition is more active in IMiD\/CELMoD-resistant cell lines compared to sensitive counterparts. Rapid clinical translation of these findings would be possible as a SETD2 inhibitor is currently in a phase 1 trial which includes MM patients. Previous pre-clinical data suggests the t(4;14) MM subgroup may be more sensitive to SETD2 inhibition but our data highlights a novel vulnerability in the IMiD\/CELMoD resistant setting that should be explored further.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET03-01 Drug resistance in molecular targeted therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Multiomics,Resistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sarah Anne Bird<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Marco Licciardello<sup>1<\/sup>, Yakinthi Chrisochoidou<sup>1<\/sup>, James Smith<sup>1<\/sup>, Amy Barber<sup>1<\/sup>, Jack Cheung<sup>1<\/sup>, Yura Grabovska<sup>1<\/sup>, Shannon Martin<sup>1<\/sup>, Fernando Sialana<sup>1<\/sup>, Harvey Che<sup>1<\/sup>, Habib Bouguenina<sup>1<\/sup>, Benjamin Bellenie<sup>1<\/sup>, Brian Walker<sup>2<\/sup>, Paul Clarke<sup>1<\/sup>, Charlotte Pawlyn<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, United Kingdom,<sup>2<\/sup>Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"945db985-fd03-4958-b186-125df2ec2f9a","ControlNumber":"1534","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.
