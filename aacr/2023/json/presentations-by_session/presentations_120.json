I will discuss how genetically engineered mouse models allowing expression of oncogenes or the deletion of tumor suppressor genes in different cell lineage of adult tissues have been instrumental to identify the cells of origin in the most frequent epithelial cancers. Using this approach, our lab has identified the cellular origin of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most frequent neoplasia in human, skin squamous cell carcinoma and mammary tumors. I will show how oncogene expressing cells undergo cell fate reprograming during tumorigenesis and how inhibition of this reprograming step can prevent tumor initiation. I will show that only stem cells and not more committed progenitor cells are the cells of origin of BCC. I will present new data identifying the molecular determinants that confer tumor initiating properties to stem cells. Using multidisciplinary approaches combining clonal analysis including intra-vital microscopy in vivo, single cell RNA sequencing, and functional analysis, we defined at a single cell resolution in living animals how mutations associated with BCC development affect clonal competition and tumor initiation. Finally, I will discuss how cell state switch can confer resistance to therapy in BCC and the identification of new drug combination that can prevent the development of resistance to therapy in BCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB01-05 Mouse models of human cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor initiating cells,Single cell,Imaging,Transgenic mice,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Cedric Blanpain<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
