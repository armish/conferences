[{"Abstract":"Fear of \"scanxiety\" (a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease about an imminent CT scan forcancer) is experienced by many cancer patients and survivors, especially lung cancer patients.Research suggests that scanxiety and fear of cancer reoccurrence are prominent and overlookedsymptoms. Although psychological interventions exist for health anxiety and scanxiety, it isunclear if they fit lung cancer patients' needs. Therefore, we will qualitatively assess lung cancerpatients' and survivors' scanxiety. Additionally, we will explore how patients and survivors cope(e.g., through social support and therapy) with their scanxiety and fears. Lung cancer patientsand survivors will complete an online questionnaire. The study will reveal the gap between lungcancer patients and survivors' scanxiety and the support they received.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christine Qiong Wu<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Our goal is to develop and promote a formal means for active patient advocacy; to facilitate cancer clinical trials awareness and accrual throughout local and state communities; and to provide a forum for cancer education about the state of cancer prevention screening, treatment, research, clinical trials and survivorship. The Karmanos Cancer Advocacy Program (KCAP) began in 2018 under the leadership of Dr. Elisabeth Heath as a partnership between patients and the research community. KCAP in an extension of the Prostate Cancer Advocacy Group (PCAP) established in 2010. The successful PCAP advocacy model expanded to include all cancers. KCAP trains survivors and their family members to help support Karmanos cancer research initiatives, review grant proposals for research studies, and become involved in volunteer led action groups that affect the future of cancer care. KCAP advocates have attended a year-long didactic training designed to promote survivor engagement in investigator driven research. The course was created for the advocates to be well prepared and empowered to engage with Karmanos Cancer Institute researchers and help direct future cancer research. Advocates develop grant-reviewing skills and began providing much needed feedback for internal and external grant review study sections. KCAP advocates participate in panel discussions and seminars on issues affecting cancer research, join advocacy groups, meet with government officials to discuss issues impacting cancer care and more. KCAP advocates have participated in events with American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ASC-CAN) speaking with state legislators about issues influencing cancer in the state. KCAP Advocates are active in the Karmanos clinic areas and provide cancer awareness and education outreach to the community through presentations to community groups or education during health fairs and other outreach events.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>William Winkler<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Patients aren''t the only ones impacted by this new law. Physicians also have concerns about the impact of patients who misread the results, receive results they are not emotionally prepared for, or who experience high degrees of stress and anxiety without available support at night, on weekends, or other times they are not able to reach their doctor right away. What&#8217;s missing is a process to help patients prepare for viewing results. Combining my experience as a patient advocate, my years of working with cancer survivors and caregivers as a coach, and my professional training gives me a unique perspective for exploring the concerns, needs, and the strategic solutions that can be integrated to overcome the challenges being created by the Cures Act. The poster will highlight both sides of the experience - those who heartily embrace immediate access to their results and those who find it anxiety-provoking along with identifying gaps in the process and strategies that could improve the overall experience for patients\/caregivers and their physicians without interfering with those who want to know right away.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tambre Leighn<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

The process can begin before the actual diagnosis, beginning with the plethora of testing that facilitates the actual diagnosis. This means that many patients are already in overload when they receive their cancer diagnosis. Most places offer tips for how patients can manage this, but there are also mechanisms that can be put in place to help patients navigate their diagnosis, treatment, and follow up care and lessening the feeling of overwhelmed on the care delivery side. This poster explores options for inclusion into small and large practices.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Blair Coe Schweiger<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

An analysis from 2019 showed that despite 25% of cancer deaths in Canada resulting from lung cancer, the research funding was a paltry 6% of all cancer research funding. The largest amount of funding at 25% is for breast cancer, though it only accounts for about 6% of cancer deaths. Canadian cancer research funding is broken down using Common Scientific Outline (CSO) into six basic categories: 1 - Biology 2 - Etiology 3 - Prevention 4 - Early detection, diagnosis, prognosis 5 - Treatment 6 - Cancer control, survivorship and outcomes. Data from the Canadian Cancer Research Alliance (CCRA) were used to explore the funding in Canada. We used the data from CCRA to create a model for the funding trends for the last fifteen years. Comparison with research funding for all cancers was used as a proxy to suggest best places to look for funding opportunities. Lung cancer research is 6% of the funding received for all cancer research. Using this as an expectation, it is immediately apparent that Prevention at 24% in the third period (2015-2019) of the analysis accounts for the majority of lung cancer research spending and indeed was a major component of overall cancer research spending. Early detection research spending is also found to be increasing. This is important as most lung cancer is detected at a late stage and accounts for the extremely high mortality rate of this cancer. The other four categories of research however are below the average in the analysis indicating under-spending relative to other cancer types. Stable but low levels of funding for basic biology research around lung cancer have limited the understanding of lung cancer. In the remaining three areas, funding has declined over the last fifteen years. There is a growing realization that there is more than carcinogenic tobacco smoke at work in causing lung cancer. More research into the etiology of lung cancer is required. Treatment for lung cancer has been revolutionized by immunotherapies, targeted therapies, radiotherapy techniques, and surgical approaches. But again in comparison to other cancers, research in lung cancer treatment have been underfunded. Finally, despite more and more lung cancer patients surviving there is a decline in cancer control, survivorship, and the outcomes of research funding. Next steps in this process beyond the obvious lobbying for more money for lung cancer research are to begin to establish patient priorities for where the money should be directed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Angus Pratt<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
