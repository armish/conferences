[{"Abstract":"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has a 95% mortality rate and a 5-year survival of 8%, resulting in the death of over 20,000 Americans each year. There has been marginal improvement in therapy over the past 30 years, with the recent addition of immune checkpoint inhibition therapy modestly increasing overall SCLC patient survival from 10.3 to 12.3 months [PMID 30280641]. This highlights the need for additional SCLC therapies. Previous studies have identified a subset of SCLC patients (10-20%) exhibiting a naturally occurring immune response called &#8216;anti-HuD&#8217;. It is associated with improved response to therapy and improved survival [PMID 9256130; 26606748]. Previous work identified the anti-HuD antigen to be ELAVL4. The Offringa lab and collaborators determined that the antigenic epitope consists of isoaspartylated ELAVL4 (isoAspELAVL4) [PMID 27725125]; the protein carries isoaspartylated residues in the N-terminal region (amino acids 1-36). All tested Anti-Hu-positive SCLC patient serum samples reacted with isoAspELAVL4, and all examined SCLC tissue samples stained positive for isoAspELAVL4 [PMID 27725125]. Here we used the Trp53fl\/fl; Rb1fl\/fl inducible SCLC mouse model [PMID 14522252] to examine 1) whether immunization with isoAspELAVL4 prior to SCLC induction is protective, and 2) whether immunization with isoAspELAVL4 following completion of 3 rounds of cisplatin+etoposide therapy increases survival. In both cases, mice were immunized with recombinant N-terminal fragment of ELAVL4 (amino acids 1-117) generated in <i>Clear Coli<\/i> and emulsified in incomplete Freund&#8217;s adjuvant (IFA) or control (phosphate-buffered saline in IFA). The trajectories of mice have been monitored with a detailed body metric score and blood has been drawn every 2 weeks to monitor the anti-ELAVL4 antibody response. Kaplan-Meier analysis will be used to assess survival differences between the immunized and control groups and will be presented. The study will provide insight into interplay between SCLC and the immune response to isoAspELAVL4.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: small cell,Immuno-oncology,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Diego  A.

However, it remains challenging to select sensitive patients upfront. PD-L1 expression, TMB and MSI\/MSS status, do not optimally differentiate between the potential sensitivity to the individual immunotherapies.<br \/><i>Purpose<\/i>: We aim to improve stratification of patients for immunotherapy through classification of patient-specific tumor sensitivity based on 3D ex vivo drug measurement.<br \/><i>Material<\/i>: Our study includes 108 Patients with predominantly ovarian carcinoma (81\/108). Tumor tissue was collected in ongoing clinical trials from biopsies, ascites or pleural fluid. Five immune checkpoint inhibitors and a STING pathway activator were tested.<br \/><i>Method<\/i>: Fresh tumor clusters were seeded into 384 well plates and exposed to different immunotherapies, while preserving the TME. Tumor killing and immune cell proliferation were measured using 3D image analysis. Ex vivo tumor sensitivity was classified as no response (&#60;10%), weak (10-20%), strong (20-50%), and very strong (&#62;50%), based on percentage tumor killing and statistical significance (p-value: * &#60; 0.05, ** &#60; 3.33e-4).<br \/><i>Results<\/i>: Differential patient response profiles were observed (Table 1). For the current cohort, we measured a highly significant immunotherapy response for ~30% of the samples. The assay has a technical success rate of 89%.<br \/><i>Conclusion<\/i>: This study reports the development of a robust ex vivo tumor testing platform that classified patient-specific sensitivity to 6 immunotherapies for over 100 patients, demonstrating the potential of ex vivo tumor testing to optimize patient stratification for immunotherapy.<br \/><i>Discussion<\/i>: The platform enables improved efficiency in clinical development of novel treatments and supports treatment decisions in the clinic.

However, not all patients respond to treatment. In fact, only 40-60% respond to treatment. Currently, only PD-L1\/PD-1 expression and mutational burden can predict response to treatment. Published data have shown that exosomal PD-L1 is an important factor contributing to response\/failure to checkpoint inhibitor treatment. Exosome is known to carry several types of cargoes and is one of the important delivery systems in the body. We have begun to examine the role of exosomal PD-L1, PD-1 in predicting response, and as well as how to overcome drug resistance. We initiated an institutional study in metastatic melanoma patients who underwent immunotherapy treatment (anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA 4 drugs). Blood samples were obtained at baseline and at subsequent treatment. Both serum and plasma exosomes were isolated. Eighteen patients were entered in the study. We have found that 1) Patients with PD-L1 negative tumor can have high exosomal PD-L1 expression, 2) all patients had exosomal PD-L1, and 3) all patients with decreased exosomal PD-L1 expression after treatment showed antitumor response [partial response (PR) or complete response (CR)]. In contrast, patients who had consistently high exosomal PD-L1 expression post-treatment showed no response, and this can be seen after the third cycle of treatment. Patients who achieved CR showed low exosomal PD-L1 and no exosomal PD-1 post-treatment. Importantly, we have also found that exosomes carry antiapoptotic protein and proapoptotic protein, as well as ATG family protein, which is related to autophagy. Whether these proteins also play a role in determining the cell fate in the metastatic sites is not known and will need future investigation. Interestingly, the two patients who showed no response also had high p-AKT. Since traditional anti PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 drugs do not have effect on exosomal PD-L1 and PD-1, we formed a collaboration with Dr. Stephane Roche at Florida Atlantic University, who has designed novel peptides by exploiting the innate plasticity of the PD-1 receptor (pembrolizumab H3 loop mimics). Thus far, we have screened many compounds and have selected 2 compounds for further testing. Together, we have also designed new PD-L1 peptides that can inhibit both PD-L1 and PI3K\/AKT pathways simultaneously. Hence one can overcome checkpoint inhibitor resistance due to exosomal PD-L1\/PD-1.

It has been reported that the HCC patients&#8217; response to the immunotherapy of PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade was associated with their gut microbiota profiles.

Despite the promising clinical efficacy, a proportion of patients escape under treatment due to the occurrence of primary and acquired resistance mechanisms that may involve the modulation of target antigen expression, cancer cell intrinsic mechanisms, T cell functionality or treatment-induced changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Therefore, a better understanding of TCB-induced resistance mechanisms is of great importance to enable the design of novel therapeutic approaches and\/or combination strategies to overcome resistance. We present the results of exploratory preclinical analysis using an aggressive lymphoma model in humanized mice and a syngeneic melanoma model in immunocompetent mice, focusing on the assessment of T cell functionality, TME reprogramming, and cancer cell intrinsic changes upon longitudinal TCB treatments, encompassing tumor regression and escape. Flow cytometry, IHC, scRNAseq and ex vivo functional analysis of T cell cytotoxicity and cytokine release demonstrate that intra-tumor T cell functionality is preserved over serial TCB treatments, including tumor escape. On the other hand, TCB treatment induced a reprogramming of the TME consisting of rapid myeloid cell infiltration, followed by the expansion of intra-tumor T cells at a later time point (favoring higher CD8:CD4 ratio). Cumulative evidence from in vitro and in vivo scRNAseq experiments provided insights into macrophage reaction to TCB-mediated T cell inflammation, consisting of a rapid (as early as 2 h) activation and upregulation of several pro-inflammatory molecules (IL-1b, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL1, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, IFN-g-induced genes: GBP2 -8 and BATF2). This was followed by a shift towards a more suppressive phenotype at later time points (20-96 h) as evidenced by the expression of PD-L1, INHBA, IDO, FLT1 genes. The analysis of cancer cells showed upregulation of Wnt\/beta catenin, p53 and Hedgehog signaling pathways at tumor escape. In contrast, proliferation signatures including MYC, E2F target genes, MTORC signaling, and G2M checkpoint, along with metabolic pathways of oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis were enriched in cancer cells at regression. Taken together, our data show that T cell cytotoxicity and functional states are preserved during tumor regression and tumor escape phases, suggesting that T cell dysfunctionality is unlikely to be the sole cause of TCB resistance. TME reprogramming, consisting of a rapid myeloid cell infiltration and their acquisition of a suppressive phenotype over time, along with a selection of cancer cell clones that escape the TCB-mediated cytotoxicity and upregulate Wnt, p53 and Hedgehog pathways could contribute to TCB-mediated resistance, leading to tumor escape.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,Resistance,Tumor microenvironment,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Johannes Sam<sup>1<\/sup>, Llucia Alberti Servera<sup>1<\/sup>, Sina Nassiri<sup>1<\/sup>, Atul Sethi<sup>1<\/sup>, Alison Ribeiro<sup>1<\/sup>, Gabrielle Leclercq-Cohen<sup>1<\/sup>, Petra Schwalie<sup>2<\/sup>, Tamara Hüsser<sup>1<\/sup>, Emilio Yangueez<sup>1<\/sup>, Sylvia Herter<sup>1<\/sup>, Christian Klein<sup>1<\/sup>, Pablo Umana<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Marina Bacac<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Roche Glycart AG, Schlieren, Switzerland,<sup>2<\/sup>Roche Innovation Center Basel, Basel, Switzerland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"36d691e5-95a6-432f-8086-75e304774d9c","ControlNumber":"5903","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

They are attractive as candidate blood-based cancer detection targets because they are secreted in high copy number from cancer cells, are bound to circulating proteins and have secondary structures that prolong their half-life in blood. miRNAs that are thought to communicate between cancer associated fibroblasts and immune cells are of special interest for their potential involvement in transitions in the TIME from \"hot\" - an inflammatory state with a greater likelihood of sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors - to \"cold\" - tumors with an immunosuppressive state or immune inert state or vice versa. We have previously described a gene expression signature that distinguishes immunomodulatory (IM, inflammatory cells), mesenchymal (M, EMT differentiated cells), and mesenchymal stem-like (MSL, cancer associated fibroblasts) features of the TIME, and when converted to a binary classifier, has been shown to be correlated with response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Here we use TCGA microRNA data to identify a microRNA correlate of this classifier.<br \/>Methods: miRNA and RNA expression were collected from TCGA across five tissue types. Each tumor case was assigned a TIME phenotype as previously described [1]. Lung, breast, colon, and bladder data were used to identify miRNA&#8217;s whose expression pattern significantly correlated with at least one of three immune phenotypes identified by the previously defined algorithm. Data from the IntAct database were used to identify putative gene targets of the candidate miRNA.<br \/>Results: Of the 151 miRNAs of interest, 147 known interactions were found in the IntAct database. Of these 147 interactions, 107 were between miRNA and genes of different TIME (or immune) phenotypes while 89 were interactions between miRNAs and genes implicated in regulating immune hot and cold phenotypes.<br \/>Conclusions: We identified miRNA whose expression patterns correlates with a classifier of the TIME that has been shown to identify likely responders to immune checkpoint inhibitors. This candidate gene list was significantly enriched for both miRNA targets of known immune mediators and or targets implicated in modulating the TIME. Next steps are to further narrow the list to those detectable in blood in cancer, and to train a blood-based diagnostic that might be able to predict response to ICI therapy for those patients where tissue is not available.<br \/>References: [1] Seitz, R.S., Hurwitz, M.E., Nielsen, T.J. et al.

Imvotamab offers a novel treatment strategy in NHL by depleting CD20-expressing tumor cells through multiple mechanisms, including the recruitment of T cells to kill tumor cells through T cell dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, and enhanced immune modulation via IFN&#947;-dominant cytokine stimulation. We evaluated the activity of a surrogate cynomolgus monkey cross-reactive CD20xCD3 IgM bispecific TCE, IGM-2324, in depleting CD20-expressing B cells in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues of cynomolgus monkeys in vivo. We hypothesized that the high affinity and valency of IGM-2324 would enable potent B cell killing in blood and tissues even when B cells express low levels of CD20. Cynomolgus monkeys were administered vehicle or IGM-2324 at 5 mg\/kg or 25 mg\/kg through intravenous infusion twice weekly for a total of four doses on days 1, 4, 7, and 10. B cell depletion in peripheral blood was assessed by measuring the frequency of CD19+ B cells through flow cytometry. Administration of IGM-2324 at 5 and 25 mg\/kg resulted in a nearly complete depletion in peripheral CD19+ B cells at 8 hours post the 1<sup>st<\/sup> dose through 24 hours post the last dose on day 11. Depletion of tissue-resident B cells was evaluated in the spleen, mesenteric lymph node (MLN) and bone marrow (BM) of monkeys at 24 hours post the last dose of vehicle or IGM-2324 on day 11. Immunohistochemistry studies were conducted on the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lymphoid tissues by staining for CD19 and CD20 expression. The number and intensity of CD19 or CD20 positive B cells were determined by quantitative imaging analysis. Compared to vehicle-treated animals, significant dose-dependent reductions in both CD19 and CD20-expressing B cells were observed in spleen, MLN and BM following treatment with 5 and 25 mg\/kg of IGM-2324. Most importantly, IGM-2324 treatment led to the depletion of not only high and moderate tissue-resident CD20-expressing B cells, but also B cells that expressed low levels of CD20. Our preclinical data indicate that a CD20xCD3 IgM bispecific TCE can penetrate tissues and mediate direct killing of CD20-expressing target cells. B cell depletion in the periphery and tumors of relapsed\/refractory NHL patients is currently being evaluated as biomarker of pharmacodynamic activity and\/or efficacy for imvotamab in a Phase 1\/2 clinical study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,T cell engager,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Immunohistochemistry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Miho Oyasu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Angus  M.

Major gaps remain in our understanding of their precise mechanism of action, with findings from preclinical studies that do not translate into the clinic. We identified the cellular and molecular responses to co-stimulatory GITR and co-inhibitory TIGIT immunotherapy by using an experimental approach that overcomes these challenges. We investigated these responses in a patient-derived <i>ex vivo<\/i> system that maintains the original tumor microenvironment (TME) in its near-native state. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and paired single-cell TCR sequencing (scTCR-seq), we identified treatment induced transcriptional reprogramming in different cell lineages in the TME. We established <i>ex vivo<\/i> slice cultures from ten surgical resections of colorectal or gastric cancer. These cultures maintained all epithelial, stromal, and immune cell types and transcriptional cell states found in the original tissue sample. All tumors responded with activation of CD8, CD4 and T regulatory (Treg) cells following PMA\/Ionomycin treatment, confirming the viable and functional status of the model system. GITR agonist led to a modest increase in cytotoxic gene expression in CD8 T cells in four out of nine patients. Transcriptional non-responders had significantly increased dysfunctional phenotype at baseline compared to responders. <i>Ex vivo<\/i> analysis confirmed that only cells with an effector non-exhausted cell state responded to GITR agonist, while exhausted cells did not. GITR agonist did not induce significant changes in expression in regulatory T (Treg) or T follicular helper-like (TFh-like) cells. TIGIT antagonist increased TCR signaling and activation in all five patients. These responses were observed in both effector and exhausted cells. A reduced transcriptional response to TIGIT in CD8 T cells correlated with the increased expression of <i>GZMK<\/i>, <i>TXNIP<\/i> and <i>RGS1<\/i> together with reduced expression of metallothionine family genes. TIGIT antagonist also increased activation specifically in expanded TCR clonotypes, which are indicative of tumor antigen reactive cells. TIGIT antagonist further increased activation of TFh-like cells together with increased expression of B cell attracting chemokine <i>CXCL13<\/i>. Tregs responded with a reduced expression of <i>CTLA4<\/i> and <i>TNFRSF4 <\/i>(OX40), indicative of modulation of immunosuppressive cell state.Our approach successfully identified heterogenous cellular and patient responses to GITR stimulation and TIGIT inhibition in gastrointestinal cancers. TIGIT antagonist led to a wider reprogramming of the TME compared to the limited effects of GITR agonist. Our strategy identified mechanisms of action of immunotherapy and factors associated with response or resistance, which can aid in prioritization of targets and their clinical translation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Single cell,Immunotherapy,Gastrointestinal cancers: other,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anuja Sathe<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Carlos Ayala<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiangqi Bai<sup>1<\/sup>, Sue  M.

Over the last decade, the anticancer effects of RVS have been demonstrated in various preclinical and clinical studies. RVS contains major flavonoids such as fustin, fisetin, and sulfuretin, which were known to have apoptotic or anti-proliferative activities in various cancer cell lines. In clinical retrospective studies, RVS administration exclusively suggested more favorable outcomes with prolonged overall survival in solid cancer patients. However, the effect of RVS on immuno-oncology, especially the functional properties of T cells and their phenotypes remain unclear. Dried RVS grown in Wonju (Korea) was extracted with sterile distilled water after removing the allergen (urushiol). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from breast cancer patients with HLA-A*02:01 were isolated using a vacutainer tube and cultured for T cell expansion in the presence of interleukin (IL)-2 for 14 days. Cells were enriched above 90% CD3<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells after 14 days of expansion. Red fluorescent protein (RFP)-expressing HLA-A*02:01-matched breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231), were used to determine the anticancer activity of T cells in the presence or absence of RVS. For <i>in vitro<\/i> killing assays, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines expressing RFP were co-cultured with T cells with or without RVS treatment for 48 h, and cell viability was measured by the MTT assay. The phenotypic characteristics of the T cells were profiled by staining with various T cell surface markers, including CD3, CD4, CD8, PD-1, and CTLA4. RVS toxicity in the target cells (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231) was not observed at RVS concentrations up to 250 ug\/mL. The anticancer activity of T cells against breast cancer cells was significantly increased by adding both 10 ug\/mL and 100ug\/mL of RVS. T cells co-cultured with MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in the presence of 100 ug\/mL of RVS showed 20.6% increases in cytotoxicity in MCF7 cells and 36.2% in MDA-MB-231 cells compared to no RVS treatment. Interestingly, relative reductions in programmed death-1 (PD-1) were found in T cells co-cultured with target cells by adding RVS, even though there was no significant difference in the other markers observed. Our findings showed that RVS could improve the function of T cells against cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment, as interpreted by reduced PD-1 expression in T cells after RVS treatment. Therefore, the components of RVS are candidates for restoring T cells exhausted against cancer. Active compounds should be identified for clinical efficacy, and further studies are necessary for combination strategies with conventional cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Breast cancer,PD-1,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Seoyoung Kim<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Young-Kwan Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Hyoun Jong Moon<sup>1<\/sup>, Sunki Lim<sup>1<\/sup>, Yujeong Gho<sup>1<\/sup>, Wang Jun Lee<sup>2<\/sup>, Sanghun Lee<sup>3<\/sup>, Excelsisbio Inc.<sup><\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>New Horizon Cancer Institute, Myongji Hospital, Goyang-Si, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Myongji Hospital, Goyang-Si, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Dankook Univ.

However, only a subset of patients exhibits durable responses, emphasizing the importance of identifying mechanism of innate and acquired resistance. The relation between the circadian clock and the immune system is well established. We used a syngeneic mouse model of MSI-H CRC to investigate whether a targeted enhancement of clock repressor proteins cryptochrome 1\/2 (CRY 1\/2) may affect tumor growth and response to anti-PD1 (aPD1).<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>. 1X10<sup>6<\/sup> MC38 cells were subcutaneously implanted into the right flank of 8 weeks old C57BL\/6 mice. Mice were randomized into 1 control and 3 treatment arms (10 mice\/group): A. CRY stabilizer SHP656(10 mg\/kg PO, 5 days\/week); B. aPD1 (100 &#956;g\/mouse IP, twice\/week administered for 2 weeks); C<b>.<\/b> combination SHP656 + aPD1. Tumors from 4 mice\/group were processed for tumor infiltration studies. Remaining 6 mice\/group were kept for 3 weeks on maintenance aPD1 (twice\/week) for survival studies. Treatment response was measured by tumor growth and survival. Treatment effects on immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment (TME), functional myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and T cells markers were investigated via flow cytometry.<br \/><b>Results.<\/b> Single agent SHP656 significantly improved survival when compared with vehicle treated mice. Similarly, combination treatment with SHP656 + aPD1 improved survival, however no additional benefit was observed over treatment with aPD1 alone. All treatment groups had a response rate of 67% (4\/6 mice\/treatment group showed 2-fold decrease in tumor volume 24 days after tumor challenge vs vehicle). In responders, SHP656 as a single agent or in combination with aPD1 were more effective in suppressing tumor growth as compared to aPD1 alone. Flow cytometry of 14 tumor samples demonstrated that monocytic-MDSC infiltration was significantly decreased in the combination therapy and aPD1 alone treatment arms (<i>p <\/i>= .016) as compared to vehicle suggestive of a less suppressive TME. T cell analysis suggested a decrease in intratumoral exhausted CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells (TIM3<sup>-<\/sup>PD-1<sup>+<\/sup>, <i>p<\/i> = .02) in SHP656 + aPD1 vs vehicle, while infiltration of CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and T regulatory cells were not significantly affected by any treatment. Nanostring profiling on treated tumors also confirmed immune activation in responders.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>. Our results show for the first time that targeting the clock pathway through modulation of CRY affects TME and tumor progression in <i>in vivo<\/i> models of MSI-H CRC.<b> <\/b>A decrease in infiltration of mMDSCs and exhausted CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells seems to play a critical role in combination treatment efficacy but needs to be studied further.

The objectives of this study were to characterize rencofilstat&#8217;s anti-tumor effects alone and in combination with anti-PD1 in a murine model of fatty liver-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Murine Hep53.4 HCC cells were orthotopically implanted into livers of C57BL\/6 mice fed either a normal diet or western diet. Treatments included rencofilstat and anti-PD1 IgG, alone or in combination, from Weeks 2-4 post-implantation. End-of-study analyses included tumor growth, survival, and tumor gene expression by bulk RNA sequencing. Hep53.4 tumors in fatty livers (&#8220;fatty tumors&#8221;) were more resistant to treatments compared to tumors in nonfatty livers (&#8220;nonfatty tumors&#8221;). On the normal liver background, rencofilstat and anti-PD1 IgG as monotherapies or in combination decreased tumor volumes by 76-83%. In contrast, only combination treatment consistently decreased tumor volumes (84%) in fatty livers. Rencofilstat plus anti-PD1 IgG also extended mouse survival in the fatty liver model. Tumor transcriptomic analyses revealed marked differences between treatments and tumor types. Rencofilstat altered the expression of 3-times more genes than anti-PD1 in fatty tumors (differentially expressed genes; DEGs), whereas the two treatments affected similar number of genes in nonfatty tumors. The same was true when analysis was restricted to only those genes whose expression correlated with tumor volume. The identities of the DEGs were very different between rencofilstat and anti-PD1 treatments in nonfatty tumors. In contrast, in fatty tumors, 40% of the anti-PD1 DEGs also occurred in rencofilstat-treated tumors, suggesting that rencofilstat can moderately mimic anti-PD1 in fatty tumors. Rencofilstat DEGs also overlapped significantly with combination-treatment DEGs (46%) in fatty tumors, whereas only 7% of the anti-PD1 DEGs were represented in the combination treatment tumors. DEG pathway mapping revealed that the biological pathways predicted to be affected by rencofilstat and anti-PD1 were highly dependent on the type of tumor. In nonfatty tumors both drug treatments predominantly affected cellular biology processes such as protein processing and metabolism, but in fatty tumors both drug treatments overwhelmingly affected immune-related processes such as T cell differentiation, natural killer cells, checkpoint pathways, and cytokine-chemokine signaling. These results highlight major differences in phenotype and treatment response of tumors in fatty livers compared to nonfatty livers. Furthermore, they suggest that a combination of a checkpoint inhibitor with rencofilstat may be especially efficacious for HCC in individuals with NAFLD or NASH, due in part to rencofilstat&#8217;s multi-pathway targeting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Cyclophilin,Fatty liver,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Daren Ure<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jack Leslie<sup>2<\/sup>, Lacey Haddon<sup>1<\/sup>, Claude Fu<sup>1<\/sup>, Jelena Mann<sup>3<\/sup>, Derek Mann<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Hepion Pharmaceuticals, Edison, NJ,<sup>2<\/sup>Newcastle University, Newcastle, United Kingdom,<sup>3<\/sup>Fibrofind Ltd, Newcastle, United Kingdom,<sup>4<\/sup>Newcastle University and Fibrofind Ltd, Newcastle, United Kingdom","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ff30165d-33b7-4f5c-9369-fa934def13c3","ControlNumber":"7687","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;D.

M9657 is a bispecific conditional agonist that has been developed to bind simultaneously to mesothelin (MSLN) and CD137 to stimulate an anti-tumor immune response in the tumor microenvironment. M9657 was engineered in a tetravalent bispecific antibody (mAb<sup>2<\/sup>&#8482;) format with a human IgG1 backbone with LALA mutations, which abrogates binding to Fc&#947;Rs but retains FcRn binding for IgG-like pharmacokinetics. M9657 is expected to have enhanced anti-tumor efficacy while avoiding systemic immune activation.<br \/>Methods: MSLN surface copy number was quantified in a series of cancer cell lines with a broad range of MSLN expression. CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell-mediated tumor cell cytotoxicity and cytokine release from CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells were investigated in a series of in vitro functional assays. The receptor occupancy (RO) of MSLN on the tumor cell surface and of CD137 on CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells was determined by flow cytometry. MSLN in EMT-6 cells was knocked out using CRISPR and confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The anti-tumor efficacy of FS122m, a murine-reactive surrogate of M9657, was investigated in EMT-6 parental and MSLN knockout syngeneic tumor models.<br \/>Results: M9657 displayed MSLN-dependent cytokine release and tumor cell cytotoxicity. IFN&#947; release by CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells correlated with MSLN copy number on tumor cells. MSLN copy number of 3000 was found to be the minimum required to trigger CD137 agonism. CD137 RO by M9657 on activated human CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and MSLN RO by M9657 on tumor cells increased with increasing concentrations of M9657. M9657 caused full agonism (EC<sub>100<\/sub>) when CD137 RO on activated human CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells was approximately 30-38%. The mouse surrogate FS122m demonstrated potent dose-dependent anti-tumor efficacy in the EMT-6 tumor model, while no anti-tumor efficacy was observed in MSLN knockout tumors, which further confirmed that MSLN expression is required for M9657 anti-tumor immunity.<br \/>Conclusion: M9657 exhibits promising and potent MSLN-dependent conditional immune agonism, supporting its clinical investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,Immunotherapy,Mesothelin,CD137\/4-1BB,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chunxiao Xu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Xueyuan Zhou<sup>1<\/sup>, Sireesha Yalavarthi<sup>1<\/sup>, Rene Schweickhardt<sup>1<\/sup>, Andree Blaukat<sup>2<\/sup>, Laura Helming<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>EMD Serono, Billerica, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"846c6ea5-9a0d-4d8a-83c3-ff51f2cd567f","ControlNumber":"434","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;C.

At the same time, stimulation with ANV600 results in markedly reduced STAT5 phosphorylation on Treg cells compared to aldesleukin. In activated human PBMCs, ANV600 induces PD-1 co-internalization with the CD122-CD132 complex, reducing detectable PD-1 on CD8 and CD4 T-cells. Surface PD-1 levels decrease is not observed on cells incubated with untargeted bispecific compound. In transgenic human PD-1 mice ANV600 treatment leads to marked tumor growth retardation in the B16F10 and MC38 subcutaneous tumor models compared to untargeted compound and vehicle. Immunophenotyping of the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes revealed a dose-dependent increase of intratumoral stem-like PD-1+T cells and cytotoxic GrzB+PD-1+T cells in mice treated with ANV600.

Based on these beneficial features, PNU-159,682 is currently being clinically evaluated (phase 1) for solid tumor indications as a payload in various antibody-drug conjugates (NBE-002, SO-N102). It must be noted, however, that the HNSTD of current PNU-based ADCs in non-human primates (~1 mg\/kg) may end up in a clinical dose that is sub-optimal to achieve high tumor uptake, due to putative target-mediated drug disposition in healthy tissue.<br \/>We embarked on a program to develop a set of 2nd-generation PNU-159,682 analogues with attenuated potency, to enable the generation of ADCs with a potentially improved pharmacokinetic profile.

Our group has previously shown that the combination of HSCs with two different immunotherapies improves survival in brain tumors, but it is still not curative. In this study, we wanted to explore whether modifying HSCs can drive them into a dendritic cell phenotype or suppress them from becoming immunosuppressive myeloid cells at the tumor microenvironment to increase survival when combined with immunotherapy in a glioma model. HSCs have been historically challenging to grow <i>in vitro<\/i> for long-term culture due to the short periods of time they remain undifferentiated, which creates an extra challenge for the genetic modification of HSCs. Here, we test different <i>in vitro<\/i> conditions for expansion and modification of murine and human HSCs by employing the following methods for modulation of HSCs: shRNA lentiviral delivery, overexpression constructs, RNA electroporation, CRISPR, and AAV. This study describes the efficacy of each method as well as the observed limitations of each technique on HSCs. Furthermore, preliminary data shows IL6R downregulation as a candidate for driving HSCs into the dendritic cell lineage. Ultimately, these genetically modified cells will be used as an adjuvant therapy to improve the efficacy of various immunotherapeutic strategies against solid malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stem cells,Immunotherapy,Tumor microenvironment,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Laura Falceto Font<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Dan Jin<sup><\/sup>, Connor P.

HPN328 is a Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3)-targeting TriTAC currently being evaluated in a Phase 1\/2 clinical trial enrolling patients with advanced cancers associated with DLL3 expression, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and other neuroendocrine malignancies (NCT04471727). HPN328 consists of three binding domains: a CD3 binder for T cell engagement, an albumin binder for half-life extension, and a DLL3 binder for tumor cell engagement. We have previously reported that HPN328 induces potent dose-dependent killing of DLL3 expressing SCLC cell lines together with dose-dependent T cell activation and cytokine release in T cell co-cultures <i>in vitro<\/i>. Based on these data and the proposed mechanism of TriTAC induced tumor cell killing we hypothesized that HPN328 could induce epitope spreading and long-term immunogenic effects. To test this hypothesis, we generated an immunocompetent mouse model in which six amino acid residues corresponding to the portion of human CD3&#949; which TriTAC molecules bind were added to the N terminus of the mouse CD3&#949; subunit. Homozygous knock-in mice (hCD3&#949;) were implanted subcutaneously with MC38 murine colon cancer cell line expressing human DLL3 and treated with HPN328 following tumor establishment. HPN328 treatment led to eradication of established tumors in mice. In addition, tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) analysis was performed on tumors harvested on day 4 post HPN328 treatment. Activation markers CD69 and CD25 were induced on both CD4+ and CD8+ TILs in this model. To evaluate if HPN328 can induce long-term immunity, mice whose tumors were cured by HPN328 were rechallenged on the opposite flank. As expected, tumors grew in treatment na&#239;ve mice, but no tumors were detected in mice previously treated with HPN328, demonstrating sustained and durable anti-tumor immunity induced by HPN328 treatment. Anti-tumor immunity is an indicator of T cell memory against tumor antigens. Concomitant with anti-tumor immune response, we detected increases in memory T cells in the spleens of mice previously treated with HPN328. Together these results indicate that HPN328 can induce epitope spreading and prolonged anti-tumor immunity, suggest a novel mechanism for its activity and efficacy <i>in vivo<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,Immune response,Lung cancer: small cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Mary Ellen Molloy<sup>1<\/sup>, Laura  B.

These treatment strategies enhance the effector function of immune cells, particularly cytotoxic T cells (CTL), driving tumor eradication. Methods to improve the killing mechanisms of CTLs are not well studied and largely focused on assessing\/strengthening the antigenic responses of T cells. We hypothesize that the mechanical landscape of CTL-tumor interactions can also drastically impact CTL cytotoxicity. By altering the physical context for T cell recognition of tumors, we measured cytotoxicity changes and subsequently used these changes in killing capacities to train and generate a quantitative parametrization of T cell killing. CTLs utilize cytokine expression to kill and shape the inflammatory milieu. Taking advantage of a robotic platform that enables the automatic collection of cytokines, we assembled datasets of T cell attacks of tumor cells grown on substrates with varying stiffness levels. The stiffness levels were altered using polyacrylamide (PAA) gels and ranged from 0.2kPa to approximately 113 kPa. Preliminary results from two different models (i.e., mouse and human TCR-transgenic T cells) suggest that there exists an optimal stiffness value for maximal response by T cells. These results suggest that CTLs utilize biophysical cues in addition to molecular cues (antigen) to properly elicit an immune response&#8212;modeling and fine-tuning these mechanical cues can be a novel and effective approach to improving cancer immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antitumor activity,Machine learning,Cytokines,Human,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hannah Dada<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kun Do<sup>2<\/sup>, Alexander Cartagena-Rivera<sup>2<\/sup>, Grégoire Altan-Bonnet<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>NIH-NCI, Bethesda, MD,<sup>2<\/sup>NIH-NIBIB, Bethesda, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"da9f7b01-077d-4369-9df6-09d4d2780645","ControlNumber":"2479","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

A high infiltration of macrophages in the tumor is also correlated with a poor prognosis in several cancer types. Therefore, they became an attractive target for cancer immunotherapies. Several macrophage-targeting approaches in anticancer therapy are under development, including TAM depletion, inhibition of new TAM differentiation, or re-education of TAM activation for cancer cell phagocytosis. In this presentation, we will share different examples of in vitro assays and in vivo models we are implementing to support preclinical development of novel TAM-targeting strategies. Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) has been used to demonstrate one crucial mechanism of action of different antibody (Ab) therapies targeting macrophages. Some of these Ab (including anti-CSF1) have then been tested in syngeneic in vivo tumor models. To reach this goal, we demonstrated that the tumor implantation site in mice (subcutaneous vs orthotopic) could impact the polarization of macrophages (M1 vs M2). Differences in the ratio of M1 and M2 subtypes infiltrating the PAN-02 pancreatic murine tumors were observed, and anti-CSF1 antibodies increased the survival of mice bearing orthotopic Renca murine kidney tumor by eliminating TAMs. Additionally, in xenograft models of human breast tumors in NOD-SCID mice, the eradication of TAMs by anti-CSF1R clearly demonstrated the importance of macrophages in the tumor progression and in the anti-tumor efficacy of Abs mediated by macrophages. By using an orthotopic Hepa1-6 murine liver cancer model, we showed high antitumor efficacy of compounds targeting the STAT6 pathway by reprogramming immunosuppressive TAMs into an M1 phenotype that promotes the induction of a cytotoxic immune response. For compounds displaying no cross-reactivity with murine target, we developed models and characterized the TAMs in breast, colon, melanoma and head &#38; neck PDX and CDX tumors in different huCD34-engrafted mouse models. Altogether, the panel of in vitro assays and in vivo tumor models in OncoTAM should be useful to provide insights on the mechanism of action and antitumor efficacy of novel immune-oncology strategies targeting macrophages.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor associated macrophages,Immuno-oncology,Preclinical,In vivo,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Caroline Mignard<sup><\/sup>, Damien France<sup><\/sup>, Francis Bichat<sup><\/sup>, Nicolas Legrand<sup><\/sup>, <b>Olivier Duchamp<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Oncodesign Services, Dijon Cedex, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6f9f8cca-d87f-4cd4-b5b7-627135c474ef","ControlNumber":"6077","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are ectopic lymphoid formations that develop in inflamed, infected or tumoral tissues. TLS contain HEV and B cell follicles surrounded by a T-cell zone and are characterized by abundant chemokine expression. The presence of TLS and HEV in solid tumors is positively correlated with patient survival in many cancer types, and may even be predictive of better response to immune-checkpoint blockade. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the intratumoral HEV and TLS formation remain unclear. Using murine syngeneic tumor models, we found that systemic activation of lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTBR) with an agonistic antibody induced tumor-specific HEV formation, increased dendritic cell (DC) and T cell infiltration, and enhanced T cell activation in the tumor. <i>In vitro<\/i> assays revealed that LTBR agonism directly upregulated activation and maturation markers in bone marrow-derived DCs and promoted DC-mediated CD4 and CD8 T cell activation. Single agent LTBR agonist treatment attenuated Colon26 tumor growth in a CD8 T cell-dependent manner. In combination treatment studies, LTBR agonism further augmented anti-tumor efficacy of anti-PD1 and of CAR-T therapy. Notably, LTBR agonist mAb treatment upregulated the expression of TLS-related chemokines and induced TLS-like structures in approximately 20% of treated tumors. To enhance TLS induction, we generated syngeneic tumor models engineered to express several cytokines\/chemokines and performed an <i>in vivo<\/i> screen for tumor-associated TLS formation. We identified some factors that in combination with LTBR agonism induced B cell enrichment and immature TLS formation, while others promoted robust TLS induction and anti-tumor effect. TLS formation induced by combined LTBR agonism and cytokine expression is associated with augmented anti-tumor responses to anti-CTLA-4 treatment. By studying anti-tumor mechanisms of LTBR agonism-mediated HEV and TLS formation, this work informs the future therapeutic strategies to boost T cell infiltration and activation in solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS),Checkpoint Inhibitors,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Disi An<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Guoying Chen<sup><\/sup>, Wei Wang<sup><\/sup>, Katja Mohrs<sup><\/sup>, David DiLillo<sup><\/sup>, Christopher Daly<sup><\/sup>, Gavin Thurston<sup><\/sup>, John Lin<sup><\/sup>, Namita Gupta<sup><\/sup>, Mickey Atwal<sup><\/sup>, Frank Kuhnert<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d9f9206e-2795-46b6-ad8e-672ba1e9a011","ControlNumber":"5204","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;D.

Inupadenant (formerly known as EOS100850) is an oral, non-brain penetrant, potent and highly selective small molecule antagonist of A<sub>2A<\/sub>R. In a Phase I\/Ib clinical trial (NCT03873883), inupadenant as monotherapy showed initial evidence of clinical benefit in subjects with advanced solid tumors. In this study, tumor biopsies with a high number of A<sub>2A<\/sub>R-expressing immune cells at baseline were associated with response or stable disease.We now report that infiltration of A<sub>2A<\/sub>R<sup>+<\/sup> cells was strongly correlated with the expression of B- and, more specifically, antibody-secreting cell (ASC)-related genes, as assessed by gene expression (Nanostring) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), hinting at a potential novel role for A<sub>2A<\/sub>R in B cell biology. Therefore, we explored the expression and function of A<sub>2A<\/sub>R in human B cells. Immunocytochemistry staining of A<sub>2A<\/sub>R on sorted tonsillar B cell subsets showed that A<sub>2A<\/sub>R was predominantly expressed on ASCs, including plasma cells and plasma blasts versus na&#239;ve or memory B cells. The preferential expression of A<sub>2A<\/sub>R by ASCs was confirmed on NSCLC tissues by multiplex immunofluorescence. In addition to A<sub>2A<\/sub>R, ASCs expressed other adenosine pathway markers such as CD39, suggesting that the adenosine pathway is a key mechanism through which ASC functions may be modulated. Using B cells derived from peripheral blood, the A<sub>2A<\/sub>R agonist CGS-21680 was shown to inhibit the maturation of B cells into plasma cells, and that maturation could be fully restored by inupadenant. CGS-21680 did not affect B cell or plasma cell viability, indicating that the effect of A<sub>2A<\/sub>R signaling on plasma cell differentiation is not due to preferential plasma cell death in culture. Importantly, baseline expression of B cell- and ASC-related markers measured by Nanostring and IHC was associated with response or stable disease to inupadenant monotherapy, supporting the notion that these cells may be a novel target of inupadenant. This is in line with recent reports showing that B cells, plasma cells and tertiary lymphoid structures are associated with favorable responses to cancer immunotherapy. Interestingly, four out of the five non-progressors treated with inupadenant as monotherapy and with available biomarker data showed a reduction in ASC infiltration after inupadenant treatment, suggesting that inupadenant may promote terminal plasma cell differentiation and migration out of the tumor tissue and to the bone marrow.Altogether, these data support a novel plasma cell-centric mechanism of action of inupadenant, which may complement its reported T cell-mediated anti-tumor activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Adenosine,B cells,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Chiara Martinoli<sup>1<\/sup>, Paola Tieppo<sup>1<\/sup>, Marjorie Mercier<sup>1<\/sup>, Hussein Shehade<sup>1<\/sup>, Noemie Wald<sup>1<\/sup>, Anais Vezzu<sup>1<\/sup>, Annelise Hermant<sup>1<\/sup>, Boris Pirlot<sup>1<\/sup>, Stephanie Ma<sup>2<\/sup>, Maurizio Ceppi<sup>1<\/sup>, Yvonne McGrath<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Maura Rossetti<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>iTeos Therapeutics, Charleroi, Belgium,<sup>2<\/sup>A4P Consulting Ltd, Sandwich, United Kingdom","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d9f99735-e2f8-4d14-bc7d-b26d6a3d42cc","ControlNumber":"5890","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;C.
