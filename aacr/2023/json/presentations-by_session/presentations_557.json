To gain a deeper understanding of the molecular determinants of the HGSC milieu, we carried out a single-cell analysis of primary and metastatic tumors of HGSC. Thus, our aim is to identify molecular mechanisms that lead to immunosuppressive mechanisms of HGSC in primary and metastatic tumors of HGSC.<br \/>Methods: Fresh HGSC surgical samples from 19 patients were collected right after surgery, dissociated, and then frozen. For single-cells analysis, cells were sorted by a viability dye and CD45+\/- populations followed by Single cell 10X 3&#8217;v3 protocol (10X Genomics) and sequenced using the NovaSeq6000 S2 sequencer. Cell Ranger toolkit v3.1.0 (10x Genomics) was applied for data processing, followed by further downstream analysis using multiple packages from R Package Seurat.<br \/>Results: To elucidate the cellular heterogeneity of HGSC, we analyzed 100,480 cells, including epithelial, lymphoid, and myeloid populations; these were identified and represented across all patients. We explored the epithelial compartment further, including a total of 21,144 cells. Given the importance of metastatic lesions for the treatment and outcome of patients with HGSC, we examined expression programs among primary and omentum tumors as well treated and untreated tumors. The major differences between primary and omental metastatic tumors included enrichment of EMT pathways and angiogenesis, as well as a decrease in the IFN&#945; and IFN&#947; response in the omentum. IFN&#945; and IFN&#947; response pathways were also upregulated in primary treated (P-NACT) tumors, when compared with primary untreated (P-UT) tumors. To explore the immune compartment, we clustered the immune cells across patients in 28 sub-clusters, including 19 sub-clusters of T-cells and Natural Killer cells. Altogether, the immune infiltration on P-UT indicated an immune infiltrate environment and the composition of P-UT was highly enriched in lymphoid cells with a late stage of differentiation. This finding was also demonstrated by the analysis of T cell trajectories, with a clear definition that CD8 and CD4 cells from P-UT tumors are in a late\/ final and exhausted stage of differentiation, while post-NACT tumors (independent of tissue type) are in early stages (na&#239;ve\/ central memory). The measurement of a dysfunctional score showed that P-UT tumors have the highest scores, indicating a potential increase in tumor reactivity in P-UT tumors.<br \/>Conclusions: Collectively, these data indicate that HGSC primary and omentum tumors are very distinct niches for immune cells, with primary being much more dysfunctional than omentum tissue, which could indicate that the application of immunotherapies would have different impacts in variable niches of HGSC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Ovarian cancer,Immune cells,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Elaine Stur<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Fuduan Peng<sup>1<\/sup>, Pang-ning Teng<sup>2<\/sup>, Emine Bayraktar<sup>1<\/sup>, Min Hu<sup>1<\/sup>, Sara Corvigno<sup>1<\/sup>, David J.

In this work, we aimed at combining different histopathological approaches and AI-aided analytic tools to analyze the ecosystem of tumor tissues. By deploying AI-powered standard H&#38;E and high-dimensional imaging-mass cytometry (IMC) to FFPE tissue samples, we could extract quantitative and standardized features that couldn&#8217;t have been easily identified and integrated by eye. One tissue microarray (TMA) slide containing 108 spots of NSCLC specimens (both adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma) was stained with H&#38;E and scanned through the Axio Scan.Z1 (ZEISS) to generate high-quality virtual images. A deep learning algorithm was trained and applied to H&#38;E images to identify tumor cells. The consecutive tissue section was stained with metal-labeled antibodies and processed through the Hyperion workflow (StandardBiotools), allowing quantitative detection of a panel of 23 markers related to tumor cells (Pan-cytokeratin), tissue architecture (aSMA, Vimentin, CD31, Collagen I, nuclei), CD45+ immune cells, comprehensive of myeloid cells (CD68, CD14, CD16, CD163, CD63, CCR4), lymphoid cells (CD3, CD4, CD8, FOXP3, CD20) and immune activation (S100A8, HLA-DR, Granzyme-B, KI67, Arginase-1). Data were exported as MCD files, visualized using the MCD viewer and further analyzed with the Qupath software. Cell segmentation was performed by the CellProfiler and Ilastik softwares and main cell populations were identified by a supervised approach through Cytomap. On H&#38;E images, we generated a classifier of tumor heterogeneity, by exploring the spatial localization of tumor cells with the K-function summary statistic, which analyzes the distribution of tumor cells as a function of their distance. The resulting K-score value was then used to classify each tumor spot as diffuse, poorly clustered or highly clustered. Multiparametric computational analysis of the IMC images allowed to grasp immune and stromal classifiers, including frequency of immune cell populations in the tumor nests versus fibrotic stroma and immune cell interactions. In conclusion, AI-powered analysis of H&#38;E slides is a robust approach that can improve manual scoring and unlock tissue relevant features opening to new diagnostic possibilities. Meanwhile, the analysis of the immune ecosystem by multiparametric imaging mass cytometry allows investigating spatial patterns and cell interactions at single-cell level. Integration of these approaches is feasible and allows the identification of tumor patient profiles with clinical relevance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Artificial intelligence,Patient profiling,Imaging mass cytometry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Alessandra Rigamonti<sup>1<\/sup>, Marika Viatore<sup>2<\/sup>, Rebecca Polidori<sup>1<\/sup>, Marco Erreni<sup>3<\/sup>, Maria Fumagalli<sup>3<\/sup>, Daoud Rahal<sup>4<\/sup>, Massimo Locati<sup>1<\/sup>, Alberto Mantovani<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Federica Marchesi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Milan-Humanitas Research Hospital, Milan, Italy,<sup>2<\/sup>Humanitas Research Hospital, Milan, Italy,<sup>3<\/sup>Humanitas Research Hospital, Pieve Emanuele, Italy,<sup>4<\/sup>Humanitas Research Hospital, Rozzano, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"49f5194c-6475-44eb-bb47-28712896f52e","ControlNumber":"4338","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

We recently reported that immunogenic tumors contain spatially-localized multicellular immunity hubs characterized by expression of interferon-stimulated genes, including <i>CXCL10\/CXCL11 <\/i>(T cell attracting chemokines), and the presence of <i>IFNG<\/i>+ T cells. This suggested a positive feedback loop where T cell-derived IFN&#947; stimulates production of CXCR3 ligands, thereby attracting more T cells. However, we did not know (1) whether these hubs predict response to immunotherapy and (2) how hubs intersect with the various CD8 T cell states which play central roles in anti-tumor immunity.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>To understand the composition of this immunity hub and its potential association with immunotherapy response, we performed multiplex RNA FISH to visualize hub components in NSCLC tissue from 68 patients prior to PD1-blockade. Cells were segmented and phenotyped automatically. We additionally imaged serial sections with a second panel for markers of CD8 T cell state. We then computationally registered sequential images, integrating our panels. To identify hubs in an unbiased manner, we employed kmeans clustering.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We found that the presence of the immunity hub is predictive of subsequent response to PD1-blockade. Image registration revealed that hubs are enriched for CD8 T cells in multiple states, confirming their role as key sites of anti-tumor T cell activity. Furthermore, immunity hubs in responders contained more activated CD8 T cells and <i>IFNG<\/i>+ cells than those in nonresponders. To determine how hub heterogeneity may influence hub functions, we subclustered hubs by phenotypic composition. This analysis uncovered a &#8216;hybrid hub&#8217; subclass that spatially overlaps with structures containing stem-like TCF7+ CD8 T cells, resembling the interfollicular zone of lymph nodes. The presence of a single hybrid hub was strongly associated with RECIST response (p = 0.0005), found in 85% of responders and only 24% of non-responders. Hybrid hubs also showed a striking association with patient PFS (p = 0.0014). Using ultra-highplex RNA ISH technologies, we further explored the hybrid hubs and found they are enriched in macrophages that express CXCR3 ligands.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Our study provides insight into the multicellular networks that underlie anti-tumor immunity. Immunity hubs are predictive of response to immunotherapy in human lung cancer and organize intratumoral CD8 T cell activity. Moreover, hybrid hubs may represent an active intratumoral niche for tumor-specific stem-like T cells that sustain anti-tumor immunity. These multicellular networks are excellent candidates for biomarker development and targets for immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-01 Chemokines in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemokines,Interferons,PD-1,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jonathan Chen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Linda Nieman<sup>2<\/sup>, Maxwell Spurrell<sup>2<\/sup>, Justin Gainor<sup>2<\/sup>, Nir Hacohen<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4d5524a8-9707-4865-b182-a407951a600f","ControlNumber":"5271","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

Several pan-cancer single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses have reported how TME heterogeneity profoundly differs between cancer types. These studies mainly focused on one cell type (e.g., T-cells) and combined different technologies and bioinformatics pipelines with data being collected from both published and newly generated datasets. A comprehensive pan-cancer scRNA-seq map of the TME involving all cell types is therefore still lacking.<br \/>We obtained scRNA-seq (10x Genomics) on 234 fresh tissue samples from 161 treatment-na&#239;ve patients. Samples were collected from 9 cancer types and subjected to a uniform in-house optimized protocol of tissue dissociation, sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Abundancies of cell types and subtypes were correlated with each other and a tumor-reactive T-cell signature.<br \/>From 683,184 high-quality single cells, we identified 9 cell types and 71 subtypes of T-cells, B-cells, dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes\/macrophages and endothelial-cells (ECs), shared between cancer types. <i>PDCD1<\/i><i> <\/i>(PD1) was expressed by differentiated T-cells subtypes (e.g., CD8<sup>+<\/sup> exhausted and CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T-helper-1 subclusters), while <i>CD274<\/i><i> <\/i>and <i>PDCD1LG <\/i>(PDL-1\/PDL-2) were mainly expressed by regulatory B-cells, immune-regulatory DCs, CXCL10<sup>+<\/sup> and CCL2<sup>+<\/sup> monocyte-derived macrophages as well as inflammatory ECs. Pairwise analyses showed positive correlations between PD1-expressing T-cell subclusters, CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T-regulatory cells, plasma B-cells (plasmablasts, IgA and IgG plasma cells), immune-regulatory DCs, CXCL10<sup>+ <\/sup>and CCL2<sup>+<\/sup> macrophages and lymphatic ECs. On the other hand, negative correlations were observed with na&#239;ve T- and B-cells, conventional DC2 (cDC2), monocytes, CX3CR1<sup>+<\/sup> macrophages, as well as arterial and capillary ECs. When ranking individual tumors based on a tumor-reactive T-cell signature, we found reactive tumors to correlate with positively interacting subtypes, while they anti-correlated with subclusters negatively interacting with PD1-expressing differentiated T-cells. Upon deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data using gene signatures derived from each subcluster, these correlations were replicated in TCGA datasets across cancers. These signature scores correlated with tumor mutation burden (TMB) and other immunological features, while they were also predictive of response in clinical trials involving ICB.<br \/>We provide insights into the TME complexity at unprecedented level, identifying numerous subclusters enriched in immune-reactive (hot) or -suppressive (cold) tumors across cancer types. We validate these observations in TCGA by deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data, and show that already pre-treatment several TME subclusters predict response to ICB.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Immune checkpoint blockade,Predictive biomarkers,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Francesca Lodi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sam Vanmassenhove<sup>1<\/sup>, Elena Donders<sup>2<\/sup>, Pierre Van Mol<sup>2<\/sup>, Amelie Franken<sup>1<\/sup>, Sarah Cappuyns<sup>3<\/sup>, Ayse Bassez<sup>1<\/sup>, Siel Olbrecht<sup>4<\/sup>, Liselore Loverix<sup>4<\/sup>, Michel Bila<sup>5<\/sup>, Hanne Vos<sup>6<\/sup>, Joanna Pozniak<sup>7<\/sup>, Kevin Punie<sup>8<\/sup>, Diether Lambrechts<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Laboratory for Translational Genetics, Department of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, VIB-KU Leuven Center for Cancer Biology, Leuven, Belgium,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Pneumology, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, VIB-KU Leuven Center for Cancer Biology, Leuven, Belgium,<sup>3<\/sup>Digestive Oncology, Department of Gastroenterology, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, VIB-KU Leuven Center for Cancer Biology, Leuven, Belgium,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Oncology, Laboratory of Gynaecologic Oncology, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, VIB-KU Leuven Center for Cancer Biology, Leuven, Belgium,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Oncology, UZ Leuven - KU Leuven Laboratory of Experimental Oncology, Leuven, Belgium, VIB-KU Leuven Center for Cancer Biology, Leuven, Belgium,<sup>6<\/sup>Department of Surgical Oncology, University Hospitals Leuven, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, Leuven, Belgium,<sup>7<\/sup>Laboratory for Molecular Cancer Biology, Department of Oncology, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, VIB-KU Leuven Center for Cancer Biology, Leuven, Belgium,<sup>8<\/sup>Department of General Medical Oncology, University Hospitals Leuven, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, Leuven, Belgium","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9ec85513-30a8-472e-80e7-b5581ba7081c","ControlNumber":"4423","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

However, it remains unclear which aspects of the tumor microenvironment (TME) determine a patient&#8217;s response. The TME is usually characterized by immune cell density, which ignores cells&#8217; spatial relationships relative to each other.<br \/>Methods: Using multiplex immunofluorescence data (PanCK, CD20, CD68, CD3, CD8, and FoxP3 antibody panel) of 24 pre-ICI UC transurethral resections retrieved from the NABUCCO trial (NCT03387761), we spatially profiled cancer cells, macrophages, B-cells, and distinct T-cell populations. We first quantified the TME immune cell densities at the tumor and stroma tissue compartments. We then quantified the TME spatial relationships with a novel approach based on fitting a Weibull function to the first nearest neighbor (1-NN) distance distribution, allowing us to uniquely summarize spatial relationships with two parameters (Weibull approach). We compared this approach to conventional techniques (G-functions) that rely upon a predefined distance threshold. We performed a simulation study to identify sources of variation in the spatial relationship parameters. Lastly, we associated the TME parameters with ICI (ipilimumab + nivolumab) response.<br \/>Results: Unlike the Weibull approach, the G-function quantifications manifested a variable effect size and statistical power in association studies because of its distance threshold dependence. We found that variation in density affected the spatial relationship metrics of rare cell types (i.e., B-cells) but not of abundant cell types (i.e., cancer cells). The spatial relationship metrics from the Weibull approach outperformed immune cell density in ICI response prediction. Specifically, immune cell density did not discriminate between ICI response groups (FDR&#62;10%). In contrast, the spatial relationship between either CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells or macrophages to their closest cancer cell did associate with response to ICI (FDR=1%). Furthermore, non-responding tumors were characterized by CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells close to B-cells (FDR=9%). Importantly, we validated the association between proximity and response from CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells to cancer cells (FDR=1%) and from macrophages to cancer cells (FDR=1%) using data from 25 pre-ICI head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tumors from the IMCISION trial (NCT03003637, arm B, ipilimumab + nivolumab).<br \/>Conclusion: We created a framework to quantify, study, interpret and analyze spatial relationships in the TME and illustrated its superior clinical relevance compared to density metrics for predicting ICI treatment response. Our findings emphasize the importance of spatial relationships in the TME for response and suggest that proximity between either macrophages or CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells to cancer cells are candidate biomarkers for ICI response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Immune cells,Immune checkpoint blockade,Urothelial cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alberto Gil-Jimenez<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nick van Dijk<sup>1<\/sup>, Yoni Lubeck<sup>2<\/sup>, Maurits L. van Montfoort<sup>1<\/sup>, Dennis Peters<sup>2<\/sup>, Erik Hooijberg<sup>2<\/sup>, Annegien Broeks<sup>3<\/sup>, Joris L.

ER+ disease is putatively believed to be immune cold, however, there exists a subset of ER+ tumors with high immune infiltrate and with a significant spatial heterogeneity. The clinic impact of such infiltrate - especially between the Oncotype Dx Recurrence Score risk categories - remains unclear. Moreover, the distribution of tumor and stromal tissues, while noted as significantly heterogenous, is still ill-defined and not yet clinically used prognostically, despite evidence to support its utility. Using a cohort (n=450) of serial sections taken from early-stage, ER+\/HER2- breast tumors of the Irish arm of the TAILORx clinical trial, we aimed to investigate the tumor architecture and spatial distribution of tumor immune infiltrate and proliferating tumor cells using digital image analysis. Antibodies against Ki67 (proliferation marker) and CD45 (leukocyte common antigen), and a routine Haematoxylin and Eosin stain were applied to serial sections of 450 full-face tumors via chromogenic immunohistochemistry, as outlined previously [1]. Digital image analysis was performed using open-source software, QuPath [2]. Pixel classifiers were trained and validated against an expert pathologist in order to define observed lymphocytes as tumor or stromal-infiltrating, and to establish a classifier to quantify the tumor-stroma ratio (TSR) and infiltrating tumor area. Distances of CD45-positive cells from tumor were computed, along with autocorrelation statistics [3,4] of CD45 and Ki67 hotspots; firstly in order to quantify spatial heterogeneity, and secondly to examine whether Ki67 as a component gene in the Oncotype Dx assay has a foundation in tumor biology or is being confounded by potentially Ki67-positive lymphocytes. Subdividing by Oncotype Dx risk categories, no significant difference in TSR was observed (p=0.09799), neither for intermediary risk patients receiving hormone therapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy (p=0.3873). While there was an observed trend overall (p=0.092), no significance was found for recurrence between intermediary risk subcategories (HT alone: p=0.393, HT+CT: p=0.288). However, in the cohort as a whole, median TSR was 0.3215 (range 0 - 5.023), with statistically significant differences in recurrence risk observed (cohort high v low by median TSR. HR: 6.356, 95CI: 2.263-17.84, p&#60;0.0001).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Image analysis,Prognostic factors,Tumour Microenvironment,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zak Kinsella<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Anna Blümel<sup>1<\/sup>, Mairi Lucas<sup>1<\/sup>, Andreas Lindner<sup>1<\/sup>, Claudia  A.

However, in patients with RCC brain metastases, response rates are low and survival outcomes poor. To understand the tumor microenvironmental differences between primary kidney tumors, extracranial metastases, and brain metastases, we developed a detailed single-cell atlas of RCC brain metastases along with their matched extracranial and primary tumors.<br \/>Methods: We performed single-nucleus RNA-seq on 27 samples (nearly 200,000 cells) from RCC patients; samples included 14 brain metastases, 8 matched primary kidney tumors, and 5 matched extracranial metastases. We performed multiplex IHC to validate selected transcriptomic findings. We used Nanostring CosMx 960-plex RNA spatial molecular imaging technique on selected samples to validate cellular interactions in a spatial context.<br \/>Results: We established a multi-tissue single-cell atlas of RCC brain metastases by identifying 9 major and 37 minor malignant, immune, and stromal cell clusters. Brain metastases had higher neuronal and glial cells interacting with immune and tumor cells. Brain metastasis tumor cells were also transcriptomically reprogrammed to adapt to the brain microenvironment through enrichment of MYC targets, MTORC1 signaling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, fatty-acid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and reactive oxygen species pathways. Moreover, cell-to-cell communication and downstream target gene expression analyses showed that brain metastasis tumor cells expressed ligands and receptors that induce tumor cell proliferation in both autocrine and paracrine fashions. Among T-cell populations, we found fewer proliferating cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the brain than in other sites. Moreover, T cells in brain metastases expressed higher levels of several targetable inhibitory checkpoints than did extracranial metastases. In addition, we found that na&#239;ve\/memory T cells in brain metastases were a favorable prognostic marker for overall survival after craniotomy. Our characterization of myeloid cell populations across the 3 disease sites found fewer dendritic cells and monocytes in the brain compared to other sites. Macrophages in brain metastases more highly expressed an M2 immunosuppressive gene signature than did those in primary RCC tumors.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings from the largest single-cell atlas of RCC brain metastases with matched primary and extracranial metastases suggest several unique targetable, immunosuppressive biological mechanisms in the brain microenvironment. These results provide a foundation for a deeper understanding of RCC brain metastasis biology and can serve as a resource for the scientific community to further explore therapeutically targetable tumor and immune-related mechanisms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-08 Organ-specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain metastasis,Kidney cancer,Single cell,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Elshad Hasanov<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Truong Nguyen Anh Lam<sup>1<\/sup>, Jerome Lin<sup>1<\/sup>, Patrick  K.
