This presentation will discuss early findings supporting the relevance of oncosomes, large extracellular vesicles, in early-stage breast cancer and its potential utility in early detection and cell-level staging of the disease when combined with the cellular profiles.<br \/>Breast cancer (BC) affects 1 in every 8 women in the United States and is currently the most prevalent cancer worldwide. Precise staging at diagnosis and prognosis are essential components for the clinical management of BC patients. We set out to evaluate the feasibility of a next generation liquid biopsy platform to stratify late-stage BC, early-stage BC, and age- and gender matched controls using peripheral blood samples. Utilizing 5 biomarkers, we can identify rare circulating events with epithelial, mesenchymal, endothelial and hematological origin. We detected a higher level of CTCs in late-stage patients, compared to the early-stage and normal donors. We observed more tumor-associated oncosomes in the early-stage, compared to late-stage and the normal donor groups. Overall, we were able to detect reproducible patterns in the enumeration of rare cells and oncosomes of cancer vs. normal donors with an AUC of 99%. An initial concept for cell-level staging with the liquid biopsy was applied to early-stage vs. late-stage BC samples and reached an AUC of 91% allowing for robust stratification.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL11-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Peter Kuhn<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

This aggressiveness is driven by heterogeneity between and within patients and the diffuse invasion of tumor cells deep into the normal appearing brain tissue surrounding the frank tumor abnormality. Mathematical neuro-oncology (MNO) is a burgeoning field that seeks to bring together individual patient data (like patient imaging, tissue biopsies etc) to tune mathematical models that accurately predict and quantify response to treatments <i>for each patient<\/i>. These mathematical models use both mechanistic &#8220;weather forecasting&#8221; methods and artificial intelligence pattern recognition methods. Ultimately, these models form the basis of modern \"precision medicine\" approaches to tailor therapy in a patient-specific manner. These models can be used to overcome the limited ability of imaging to accurately detect tumor cells, improve prognostic predictions, stratify patients, and assess treatment response in silico in the construction of effective clinical trials and treatment protocols, thus accelerating the pace of clinical research.<br \/>This presentation will focus on the growing translation of MNO to clinical neuro-oncology highlighting burgeoning insights into sex differences in tumor incidence, outcomes, and response to therapy. Specifically, I will discuss 1) use of our 4,500+ patient cohorts of 100,000+ annotated serial MR imaging data to develop digital twins accurately predict response and outcomes in patients and 2) our unique collection of 1000+ image-localized biopsies across nearly 200 patients to detect sex-distinct patterns of mapping between regional imaging features and underlying regional tumor biology. We will demonstrate the value of these novel combined resources in predicting response to treatment for EGFR-targeted therapies in 3 clinical trials and differentiating response to novel dendritic cells vaccines and CAR T-cell therapies in 2 additional clinical trials.<br \/>Taken together, these complimentary approaches provide a platform to incorporate inter- and intra- tumoral heterogeneity into accurate predictive models that advance precision oncology for glioblastoma patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-03 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Machine learning,Magnetic resonance imaging,Databases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kristin R.
