[{"Abstract":"Background: PRMT5, a type 2 arginine methyltransferase, has a critical role in regulating cell growth and survival in cancer. Despite this therapeutic potential, there is growing evidence that the first generation of clinical PRMT5 inhibitors may not be able to achieve high clinical efficacy due to PRMT5-driven (e.g. hematological) toxicities.<br \/>Aims: In order to pharmacologically exploit the MTAP &#8216;collateral vulnerability&#8217; mechanism for the potential of increased therapeutic index and clinical efficacy, next-generation PRMT5 inhibitors are required to bind PRMT5 in a cooperative manner with natural metabolite methylthioadenosine (MTA). Whilst MTAP-selective PRMT5 inhibitors have recently been reported,<sup>1,2,3<\/sup> there is continued interest in identifying new and structurally diverse <i>in vivo<\/i>-quality compounds to further investigate this therapeutic opportunity.<br \/>Results: To identify novel inhibitors of PRMT5 suitable for the MTAP line of sight, our hit finding strategy used a &#8216;biased&#8217; biochemical high throughput screen of a 2.4M compounds collection. MTA-cooperative hits were validated using techniques including SPR and Xray crystallography. One series identified from this screen was extensively optimized using techniques including structure-based design to improve potency, MTAP selectivity and DMPK properties. Through these optimizations, we have identified AZ-PRMT5i-1, which shows potent <i>in vitro<\/i> cellular inhibition of PRMT5, over 50-fold MTAP selectivity margin, excellent selectivity against a broad panel of methyltransferases, and suitable oral PK properties.<br \/>Conclusion: AZ-PRMT5i-1 is a structurally novel and potent PRMT5 inhibitor with high MTAP-selectivity suitable for use in <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i> PRMT5-driven models of cancer&#8217;.<br \/><i>Note: the structure of AZ-PRMT5i-1 will be disclosed at this meeting<\/i><br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{657BE2FE-4799-4F6E-B41B-7D1A5A0D0FB3}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PRMT5 Cell SDMA: IC<sub>50<\/sub> nM (HCT116 MTAP KO \/ WT)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">SDMA MTAP selectivity (fold)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">LogD \/ Rat heps CL<sub>int<\/sub> \/ Caco2 intr.

EZH2 also mediates PRC2-dependent non-histone protein methylation or directly methylates non-histone proteins to regulate gene expression independent of PRC2. EZH2 plays an important role in regulation of cell cycle, autophagy, apoptosis and cell senescence. Mutated or overexpressed EZH2 associates with cancer initiation, progression, drug resistance and immunity regulation in cancer. XNW5004 is a rationally designed selective EZH2 inhibitor which potently inhibits both wild type and mutant EZH2. XNW5004 significantly suppresses level of H3K27Me3, arrests cell cycle in G1\/S phase and promotes apoptosis in tumor. XNW5004 exhibits strong antitumor activity in EZH2-mutant lymphoma xenograft models, such as Karpas422 (Y641N), Pfeiffer (A677G) and SU-DHL-10 (Y641F). Since inhibition of EZH2 synthetically lethal in SWI\/SNF subunits mutated cancers, XNW5004 exhibits dose-dependent efficacy in solid tumor models such as G401 (SMARCB1 deficient) and COV434 (SMARCA2\/ SMARCA4 deficient) cancer cell lines and xenografts. In prostate cancer cells, EZH2 can bind to the promoter of androgen receptor (AR) gene and activate AR expression. In PARPi-treated cancer cells, inhibition of PARP (poly-ADP-ribose polymerase) diminishes PARylation of EZH2 to result in reactivation of EZH2 and drug resistance to PARPi. In tumor microenvironment, inhibition of EZH2 promotes differentiation of T cells and NK cells, enhances antigen presentation ability of dendritic cells, and increases cytokine\/chemokine secretion to recruit T cells into tumor tissue. Based on the above mechanisms, XNW5004 could potentially improve efficacy of ARi, PARPi and anti-PD-1. We have verified the synergistic effects of those combinations in multiple solid tumor xenograft models. In pharmacokinetic studies, XNW5004 has excellent oral bioavailability and exposure. XNW5004 shows good toxicological profile as well, has a wide therapeutic window in rats and dogs, and the risk of clinical safety was controllable. In summary, XNW5004 is a potent EZH2 inhibitor with promising efficacy, pharmacokinetic and safety properties. XNW5004 is expected to be a potent therapeutic candidate in cancer treatment and is now in Phase II clinical trial for both liquid and solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,EZH2,Solid tumors,Efficacy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yonghan Hu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Wei Peng<sup><\/sup>, Zhe Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Zhenwei Wu<sup><\/sup>, Xi Chen<sup><\/sup>, Yan Huang<sup><\/sup>, Xin Li<sup><\/sup>, Cungang Liu<sup><\/sup>, Xiaojun Liu<sup><\/sup>, Qifeng Shi<sup><\/sup>, Xufang Wang<sup><\/sup>, Wengui Wang<sup><\/sup>, Haiyang Wei<sup><\/sup>, Yuchuan Wu<sup><\/sup>, Jun Xian<sup><\/sup>, Linfeng Xu<sup><\/sup>, Lina Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Jinfeng Zhao<sup><\/sup>, Meijie Le<sup><\/sup>, Jing Qiang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Evopoint Biosciences Co., Ltd., Suzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d1935849-5bbe-4acb-9898-6d39eccc3ec3","ControlNumber":"1005","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

CAK is also a component of transcription factor TFIIH. CDK7 can phosphorylate RNA polymerase II at active gene promoters to permit transcription. Because of its dual role in transcription and cell cycle progression, and elevated expression level in various cancer types and association with their clinical outcomes, CDK7 inhibition could be an attractive therapeutic option for many cancers with cell cycle dysregulation and aberrant control of transcriptional processes. Here we present the potency, selectivity, and <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy of XNW9015, a potent, selective, and CNS-penetrating covalent inhibitor of CDK7. XNW9015 is covalent inhibitor with a T1\/2 of 588 min in a reversibility test on CDK7. Enzymatic assays demonstrated that XNW9015 selectively inhibited CDK7 (IC<sub>50<\/sub>, 54 nM) over other CDKs (CDK1, CDK2, CDK9, CDK12, CDK13; IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#62;10 &#956;M). XNW9015 showed excellent activities in a variety of cancer cell lines, including triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), ovarian cancer and colon cancer. In the Palbociclib-resistant breast cancer cell line MCF-7, XNW9015 exhibited antiproliferative activity, with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 81nM, while neither Palbociclib nor Fulvestrant can inhibit the cell viability. This suggests XNW9015 has a potential to overcome drug resistance to CDK4\/6 inhibitors. XNW9015 exhibited superior rodent pharmacokinetic characteristics when compared to LY3405105 (Eli Lilly and Company, WO2019099298). XNW9015 has also shown very good brain penetration capability. We measured antitumor activity of XNW9015 <i>in vivo<\/i> with that of LY3405105 in a variety of xenograft mouse models including triple negative breast cancer and colorectal cancer. These results demonstrated that XNW9015 has superior antitumor activities to LY3405105. XNW9015 has also shown a slightly better tox profile to LY3405105 in SD rats. In summary, XNW9015 has demonstrated potent<i> in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> antitumor effects, favorable pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties. XNW9015 has become a potential clinical candidate for cancer therapeutics, both as monotherapies and in combination settings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK7,Cell cycle,Breast cancer,Brain tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yonghan Hu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Dongdong Wu<sup><\/sup>, Wei Peng<sup><\/sup>, Zhenwei Wu<sup><\/sup>, Xin Li<sup><\/sup>, Xiuchun Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Yuanbao Li<sup><\/sup>, Liang Kong<sup><\/sup>, Haiyang Wei<sup><\/sup>, Xiaojun Liu<sup><\/sup>, Yuchuan Wu<sup><\/sup>, Meijie Le<sup><\/sup>, Jing Qiang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Evopoint Biosciences Co., Ltd., Suzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"50c3366e-3a5e-40da-93b6-55bff68cee0d","ControlNumber":"1000","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

TNBC is one of the most difficult cancers to treat due to the lack of three receptors, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2), found in regular forms of breast cancer (BCa). Currently, there is no targeted therapy for TNBC and treatment options to manage this lethal disease include surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. A better understanding of TNBC etiology has aided in unraveling the roles of two additional cellular targets - androgen receptor (AR) and histone lysine demethylase (KDM) - in the viability and survival of TNBC. Interestingly, AR overexpression is the most important driver of prostate cancer (PCa). A class of current medications used to treat PCa act as androgen receptor (AR) antagonists (or antiandrogens). It is therefore plausible to repurpose and optimize these antiandrogens for TNBC therapy. The proposed therapeutics are dual-acting antiandrogen-KDM inhibitors. The antiandrogen moiety of these agents will enable TNBC cell-targeting and translocation of the drug into the nucleus where inhibition of KDM will prevent transcription of KDMs that promote tumor. The three pharmacophores of these agents are (i) a surface recognition cap, (ii) a linker, and (iii) an Fe2+-binding group. Two classes of these compounds, alkyl-derivative and benzyl-derivative, vary in the design of the surface recognition cap. To optimize these agents, the linker length is varied from 2-7 methylene groups in each class and the optimal length will be determined through in vitro studies. The compounds are tested on five cancer cell lines: TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, low AR+; and MDA-MB-453, high AR+), and ER+ BCa (MCF-7) while PCa cell lines (LNCaP PCa, AR+; and DU 145, PCa, AR-) serve as controls for AR dependency of the effects of test compounds. Longer linker length compounds exhibited low micromolar cytotoxicity and selectivity for MDA-MB-231 (TNBC) and LNCaP (PCa) cell lines due to the presence of the AR. Western blot analysis on lead compounds supported significant downregulation of AR in MDA-MB-231 cells confirming the predicted mechanism of action. Thus far, the designed dual-acting therapeutics have potential to revolutionize the design of anticancer drugs and improve treatment outcome for TNBC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Androgen receptor,Histone methylation,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alexis Johnston<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Adegboyega K.

LAT-1 is used for the import of amino acid substrates (leucine, phenylalanine, and methionine) and LAT-1 expression has been showed to be increased in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells. LAT-1 is a promising target for the treatment of rapidly growing cancers, such as PDAC, in part, due to its key role in methionine import. Methionine is required for various cellular processes, including the generation of <i>S<\/i>-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and the maintenance of intracellular polyamine pools, which are essential for PDAC growth. Indeed, the biosynthesis of the higher polyamines (spermidine and spermine) requires the transfer of an aminopropyl group from decarboxylated <i>S<\/i>-adenosylmethionine (dc-SAM), illustrating the molecular connection between methionine and polyamine pools.<br \/>LAT-1 inhibition, such as with the known LAT-1 inhibitor JPH203, has shown efficacy in suppressing tumor growth in pancreatic cancer cell lines. While the early pre-clinical data is promising, competitive inhibitors of LAT-1 may have limited potency in the presence of high extracellular levels of LAT-1 substrates.<br \/>In contrast, LAT-1 efflux agonists are insensitive to extracellular LAT-1 substrates. These novel compounds reverse the flow of substrates through LAT-1, effectively depleting cells of key intracellular amino acids, rather than blocking the import of extracellular substrates like methionine.<br \/>The chiral piperazine (1), our lead efflux agonist, was discovered by a high throughput screen and was shown to deplete intracellular methionine, leucine and phenylalanine pools by LC-MS as well as decrease the synthesis of the higher polyamines (spermidine and spermine), a process which is reliant upon methionine as a precursor.

There are 2 isoforms of ADAR1 (p110 in the nucleus; p150 in cytoplasm) and both modify self dsRNA in coding and non-coding regions&#8203;. The ADAR1 p150 isoform is expressed from an interferon (IFN)-response promoter and has a Z-DNA\/Z-RNA binding domain at the N-terminus. ADAR1 p150 edits 3&#8242;-untranslated region dsRNAs comprising of inverted <i>Alu<\/i> repeats and thereby suppresses MDA5-MAVS-IFN signaling. ADAR1 is commonly overexpressed in multiple myeloma, breast, lung, liver, skin and esophageal cancer where it promotes cancer progression. Inhibition of ADAR1 has promising anti-tumor efficacy as monotherapy and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, radiotherapy and chemotherapeutic modalities. Herein, we outline the discovery of a potential first-in-class ADAR1 inhibitor for cancer immunotherapy.<br \/>Methods: AVA-ADR-001 was identified through a high throughput p110 knockout cell-based assay. The ability of AVA-ADR-001 to induce interferons was confirmed in various cell lines like A549 p110 KO, HCT116 and B16F10. Finally, the anti-tumor efficacy of AVA-ADR-001 was evaluated in B16F10 syngeneic melanoma mice model as monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD-1.<br \/>Results: We have identified a first-in-class small molecule inhibitor of ADAR1, which shows significant IFN response <i>in vitro <\/i>in an MDA5 dependent manner. <i>In vitro<\/i> binding studies have confirmed direct binding of AVA-ADR-001 with the Z&#945; domain of ADAR1 thus confirming its selectivity to the p150 isoform. AVA-ADR-001 demonstrates micromolar EC50 and anti-tumor efficacy against B16F10 melanoma syngeneic mouse model. 100 &#181;g of AVA-ADR-001 treatment resulted in 45% tumor growth inhibition (TGI), 1.5x superior to Anti-PD1 treatment. Combining AVA-ADR-001 with Anti-PD1 demonstrated a synergistic effect 2x superior to Anti-PD1 alone. Additionally, several interferon stimulated genes like IFIH1, IFN-&#946; and CXCL-10 were<br \/>significantly upregulated in the tumor samples of the AVA-ADR-001 monotherapy and combination groups.<br \/>Conclusions: To our knowledge no selective small molecule inhibitors of ADAR1 have been reported so far and AVA-ADR-001 is the first disclosure of such an inhibitor. AVA-ADR-001 is a potent and selective first-in-class ADAR1 inhibitor which has shown significant IFN induction in various cancer cell lines and <i>in vivo<\/i> in the tumor microenvironment resulting in substantial tumor growth inhibition as monotherapy and synergistically in combination with Anti-PD1. Considering the immune-suppressive and pro-metastatic role of ADAR1, AVA-ADR-001 serves as a promising starting point for novel ADAR1 inhibitors as therapeutic modalities in cancer immunotherapy.<br \/>Keywords: Cancer immunotherapy, small molecule inhibitors, ADAR1, innate immunity","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Innate immunity,Small molecule inhibitor,Combination studies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Aditya Kulkarni<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Avijit Goswami<sup>2<\/sup>, Sandeep Goyal<sup>2<\/sup>, Kawaljit Singh<sup>2<\/sup>, Princy Khurana<sup>2<\/sup>, Ishani Ghoshal<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Avammune Therapeutics, King of Prussia, PA,<sup>2<\/sup>Aten Porus Lifesciences, Bangalore, India","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"95a1d3c1-731f-4532-9218-fcec574cc74e","ControlNumber":"787","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Studies have shown ACK1 phosphorylates proteins in oncogenic pathways active in lung, leukemia, ovarian, breast, and prostate cancers. Some of these phosphorylated proteins include tyrosine-kinase B (AKT), androgen receptor (AR), tumor suppressor WWdomain oxidoreductase (WWOX), proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase (FYN), and growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (Grb2). ACK1 plays a pivotal role in leukemia, breast, and prostate cancer making it an attractive anticancer drug target. The development of novel ACK1 inhibitors using a pyrrolopyrimidine scaffold is described using molecular modeling and structure-activity relationships (SAR) studies. The synthesis of a focused library using a fragment-based design strategy will be highlighted as well as progress to optimize these compounds for potency, selectivity, and cell permeability. To gain structural insights for the development of novel, potent and selective ACK1 inhibitors, we have obtained X-ray structures of our compounds bound to human ACK1. We will describe the use of molecular docking to predict the binding mode of our compounds using both reported and our new ACK1 co-crystal structures. The key residues in the ATP binding pocket of ACK1 that are exploited for inhibitor design and kinase selectivity and synthetic routes to promising compounds will be discussed. We will present the K<sub>D<\/sub>s of the most potent compounds derived using a differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) thermal shift assay and cellular activities in UKE1 leukemia and MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. We will present preliminary assessment of drug-like properties, used to optimize the inhibitor class for selection of a candidate for mouse studies. Overall, our work will highlight identification\/optimization of novel ACK1 inhibitors via a fragment-based approach using pyrrolopyrimidine scaffolds and their potential use as anticancer agents.

G4 sequences are widely though not randomly distributed in the human genome. They are over-represented in telomeres and in the regulatory regions of many cancer-related genes such as KIT, MYC, VEGF, RAS and HIF. G4 structures can be unwound by helicase activity but can be stabilized by the binding of high-affinity small molecules. The compound QN-302, a tetra-substituted naphthalene diimide (ND) derivative, has nanomolar affinity and selectivity for several DNA and RNA G4s over duplex DNA. QN-302 has single-digit nM anti-proliferative activity in a panel of human pancreatic cancer (PDAC) cell lines (Ahmed et al., ACS Med Chem Lett, 2020, 11, 1634-1644). It has significant anti-tumor activity in several models for PDAC - in a MIA-PACA2 xenograft, in the genetic KPC model and in an orthotopic BX-PC3 model. QN-302 is currently in an advanced stage of pre-IND development by Qualigen Inc as a novel anti-cancer agent. QN-302 is the latest in several generations of NDs developed by us and designed by computer modelling based on earlier G4 co-crystal structures determined in this laboratory. The database of seven ND-containing crystal structures includes four different NDs with distinct side chain end groups, all with intramolecular telomeric parallel G4s. End-groups include N-methyl piperazine, hydroxyl, morpholino and N-dimethyl. These structures have been systematically compared for example using least-squares overlays of the structures. All the structures have their four substituents positioned each in a G4 groove, although there are significant differences in orientations of the end groups. Surprisingly, the naphthalene diimide cores do not retain the same orientation in each structure, with three distinct orientations being apparent. Examination of ND core overlap with the adjacent G-quartet has revealed variation in the degree of heterocycle-guanine base overlap, which is dependent on the nature and size of each substituent. However, all structures show minimal ND-guanine overlap, with typically just one out of four guanines in a G-quartet being involved. This strongly implies that most of the contribution to ND-G4 affinity comes from the side chains, and especially from the protonated end groups. These and other observations have led us to develop a structure-activity framework for tetra-substituted NDs, which has culminated in their optimization and the design of QN-302, with enhanced cellular potency and G4 affinity compared to previous NDs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug design,DNA binding,Pancreatic cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Stephen Neidle<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>School of Pharmacy, University College London (UCL), London, United Kingdom","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"46c6b4b9-d96e-4d0c-a816-bcf650b49ce5","ControlNumber":"3375","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

Based on the in vitro and in vivo characterization studies of dasatanib, several metabolites were identified. Dasatinib and its metabolite 20 were the major circulating species identified which represented 25.5% and 12.5% of total radioactivity in human plasma respectively. Here, we report the identification of HND-01, a small molecule inhibitor of Bruton&#8217;s tyrosine kinase (BTK) which was achieved by modifying metabolite 20 of dasatinib. Bruton&#8217;s tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a non-receptor kinase and a key regulator of the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway. BCR is critical for proliferation and survival of leukemic cells in many B cell malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). BTK is a key target for the development of small molecule inhibitors in B cell malignancies. There are several covalent BTK inhibitors including ibrutinib that have been approved. These covalent inhibitors <i>bind with high affinity to Cys-481 in the active site of BTK<\/i><i>.<\/i> However, some patients develop acquired resistance to ibrutinib due to <i>Cys-481 <\/i>mutation in the BTK binding site. The acquired resistance to covalent inhibitors can be overcome with the design of new reversible BTK inhibitors. The reversible BTK inhibitors will bind to different sites other than the cysteine residue of BTK and inactivate BTK. These drugs would potentially be active in the presence or absence of the cysteine-to-serine mutation. HND-01, a novel and potent reversible BTK inhibitor inhibits wild type &#38; C481S mutant BTK with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 0.157 nM for WTBTK and 0.032 nM for C481SBTK. HND-01 inhibits K562 cell proliferation (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 0.183 nM) and it is more stable than dasatinib in human liver microsomes (in vitro clearance; 142 mL\/min\/kg for HND-01 vs 211 mL\/min\/kg for dasatinib). In an established human lymphoma efficacy model (TMD-8 model), HND-01 showed stronger tumor inhibition (80.6%)<b> <\/b>than Ibrutinib (58%). These data demonstrates that HND-01 is a BTK inhibitor that is more potent with potential desirable ADME properties than ibrutinib.

Challenges in targeting GBM arise from the involvement of various pro-survival pathways, being comprised of four different cellular states, and displaying heterogeneity between each tumor. Marketed FDA-approved drugs for GBM have demonstrated limited efficacy, toxicity issues, resistance, and poor BBB penetrance. Further probing into pathway breakdowns led to the discovery of the DYRKs (dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase), CLKs (CDC-like kinases), PDGFRA\/B (platelet-derived growth factor receptor), and PI3K&#945; (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) involvement and overexpression. The upregulation of these kinases are found to be prominently involved in GBM cell proliferation, survival, replication, aggression, metastasis, and resistance. Herein, we believe that the development of pleiotropic competitive inhibitors for the treatment of GBM could be a promising therapeutic option based on literature precedence and current data from research. DYR726, a water-soluble, pleiotropic inhibitor [IC<sub>50<\/sub> PDGFRA\/B\/PI3K&#945;\/CLk2\/3DYRK1a\/2\/3 ( 53.0\/ 48.0\/ 6.2\/15.13\/137\/4\/38.6\/11.2 nM)] has demonstrated <i>in vitro<\/i> cellular efficacy across various GBM cell lines. When treated in non-cancerous cell lines, DYR726 displayed an optimal therapeutic window, which is not observed in any glioma drugs currently in clinical trials. At 1&#181;M concentrations, complete dissociation of the formation of neural stem cells and neurosphere growth in glioma cells are observed. Reduction in metastasis and proliferation are found when treated with DYR726 over three weeks. <i>In vitro<\/i> efficacy against current approved FDA treatment options and clinical candidates has been extensively tested across numerous GBM cell lines. When benched against one of the best PI3K kinase inhibitors in the clinic, Buparlisib, DYR726 was comparable, indicating a disruption in the RTK signaling survival pathway that is commonly associated with GBM. DYR726 performed favorably against Avapritinib (clinical trials for gliomas are beginning at Stanford) and when treated against FDA-approved combination treatment Dabrafenib+Trametinib (for 2% of glioma patients), it performed identically, suggesting that DYR726 can inhibit the cells at the same rate as the new FDA drug. Within patient-derived cell lines, it behaves identically to Buparlisib, and DYR726 has been shown to outperform AstraZenecas&#8217; Osimertinib (which was significantly less potent) and Tafinlars&#8217; Dabrafenib (displayed no effect). Based on the significance of efficacy, this series is on the CRUK Glasgow Cancer Center grant renewal as a potential Phase 0 within the next five years.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Small molecule inhibitor,Drug design,Glioblastoma multiforme,Kinase inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alessandra Fistrovich<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Vasudah Tandon<sup>2<\/sup>, Carly Cabel<sup>3<\/sup>, Laura Basantes<sup>1<\/sup>, Curtis Thorne<sup>4<\/sup>, William Montfort<sup>1<\/sup>, Sourav Banerjee<sup>5<\/sup>, Christopher Hulme<sup>6<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Chemistry and Biochemistry, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ,<sup>2<\/sup>Cellular Medicine, The University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom,<sup>3<\/sup>Molecular and Cellular Biology, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ,<sup>4<\/sup>Cellular and Molecular Medicine, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ,<sup>5<\/sup>School of Medicine, University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom,<sup>6<\/sup>Pharmacy, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8d7584db-5394-44de-bea0-07d175c9d68c","ControlNumber":"7456","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

LC3, a ubiquitin-like protein, plays a key role in the regulation of cargo selection and autophagosome formation. Given small molecule inhibitors have not been well developed to target LC3, we aim to design and synthesize an LC3 binder and evaluate its activity in the inhibition of autophagy pathway in cancer cells.<br \/>Methods: The crystal structure of LC3 and p62 complex (PDB: 2ZJD) was used to assist our design of helical sulfonyl-&#947;-AApeptides to the LC3 interacting region of p62. The peptidomimetics were synthesized on the solid phase and purified by HPLC. We used fluorescent polarization assay to assess the binding affinity of the peptidomimetics to LC3. We then utilized an LC3 HiBiT reporter cell line (U2OS) from Promega, which was engineered to have a fused human LC3-HiBiT with a HaloTag in between to study the effect of the lead LC3 binder on autophagic flux. In addition, confocal microscopy enabled direction visualization of the colocalization of FITC-labeled LC3 binder with LC3 and lysosome, respectively. Cytotoxicity of LC3 binder was evaluated in colorectal cancer cell line HCT116.<br \/>Results: We designed and synthesized 6 helical sulfonyl-&#947;-AApeptides (JC1-6) to target the binding interface of LC3 and p62. These peptidomimetic compounds were designed to retain essential LC3 and p62 interactions at the W and L regions and yet have different functional groups on the helical scaffold. Compounds JC1 and JC6 have binding affinity of K<sub>d<\/sub> 280 nM and 150 nM with LC3, respectively. FITC-labelled JC6 was able to penetrate U2OS and HCT116 cells. It had intracytoplasmic colocalization with not only lysosomes but also LC3 aggregates. Direct visualization of intracytoplasmic LC3 aggregates showed that JC6 at 50 &#181;M significantly inhibited the autophagic degradation of LC3 aggregates. This effect was augmented by the presence of 2 &#181;M autophagy activator PP242. Lastly, JC6 demonstrated cytotoxicity with IC<sub>50<\/sub> approximately 50 &#181;M in HCT116 cells bearing baseline autophagy activation compared to lack of cytotoxicity in U2OS cells with no baseline autophagy activity.<br \/>Conclusion: We designed and synthesized novel helical sulfonyl-&#947;-AApeptide LC3 binders. With the ability of cellular penetration, they demonstrated inhibition of autophagic flux and preliminary cytotoxicity in cancer cells. Future studies may focus on structural activity relationship and further evaluation of its mechanisms of action in cancer cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Autophagy,peptidomimetics,LC3,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Mentalla Mahmoud<sup>1<\/sup>, Jianyu Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Jianfeng Cai<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Hao Xie<\/b><sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Chemistry, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL,<sup>2<\/sup>Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"56c83872-fa09-41a2-b9f1-4517a63e7479","ControlNumber":"2669","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Female breast cancer is the second leading cancer in incidence rates among women after lung cancer. It is also more deadly amongst Black and Hispanic women as mortality rates increase by 40% compared to their caucasian counterparts. Hence, there is a dire need to design and develop novel molecules as effective anticancer agents. Rational design-based drug discovery has led to advancements in developing novel small molecules as effective anticancer agents. Chronic inflammation is directly related to cancer. Literature testifies to the presence and overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in various inflammation-based ailments, diseases, and many cancers. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the relevance of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition in cancer therapy. The tetrahydropyridine structure has been documented in several natural products. They display biological properties including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and chemotherapeutic. Substituted benzoylamino-5-ethyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine analogues have been designed as COX-2 inhibitors. This project aims to synthesize thirteen novel THP analogues using a 4-step synthesis. The synthesis of these 1,2,3,6-THP analogues primarily involves the hydrolysis of ethyl-o-(mesitylenesulfonyl) acethydroxymate to render O-(mesitylsulfonyl)hydroxylamine (MSH). MSH then acts as an aminating agent as it reacts with 3-ethyl pyridine. This amination reaction affords the mesitylene salt, 1-amino-3-ethylpyridin-1-ium. Next, the salt product undergoes acylation with various substituted benzoyl chlorides to generate stable N-ylide products. Finally, the partial reduction of the ylides yields the desired final tetrahydropyridine products. Purification was completed by flash chromatography. The novel THP analogues were characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Computer-aided drug design studies provided the preliminary data constituting that the likelihood of the THP moiety generating more effective COX-2 inhibitors is dependent on suitable modifications to the structure. Further studies include testing the novel THP analogues as cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors using COX-2 inhibition assays, and lastly, determining their anti-breast cancer activity in MDA-MD-231, MCF-7 and Ishikawa cell lines to assess their antiproliferative effects. <i>This research was supported by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number U54 MD007582.

The G-quadruplex formed in the <i>MYC<\/i> oncogene promoter (MycG4) is a transcriptional silencer and amenable to small molecule targeting. G-quadruplexes are noncanonical four-stranded DNA or RNA secondary structures that have emerged as novel therapeutic targets. Indenoisoquinolines are human topoisomerase I inhibitors with improved physicochemical and biological properties as compared to the clinically used camptothecin anticancer drugs. Three indenoisoquinolines, indotecan (LMP400), indimitecan (LMP776), and LMP744, have entered phase I clinical trials in adults with relapsed solid tumors and lymphomas. However, some indenoisoquinolines showed potent anticancer activity without being strong topoisomerase I inhibitors, suggesting additional mechanisms of action. Herein, we demonstrate that a large number of anticancer indenoisoquinolines strongly bind and stabilize MycG4<i> in vitro,<\/i> using fluorescence, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, as well as gel electromobility shift assay (EMSA).

Structure-activity-relationships of MycG4 recognition by indenoisoquinolines were investigated to understand structural requirements for binding. Systemic analysis of indenoisoquinoline derivatives led to the discovery of a synergistic effect of MYC inhibition and topoisomerase I inhibition on anticancer activity. Therefore, these results indicate that targeting the MYC promoter G-quadruplex to downregulate MYC is a new mechanism of action for anticancer indenoisoquinolines. Moreover, our data reveals dual targeting of MycG4 and topoisomerase I as a novel strategy for cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"G-quadruplex,Topoisomerase I inhibitor,Drug design,Myc,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Danzhou Yang<sup><\/sup>, Mark Cushman<sup><\/sup>, Kai-Bo Wang<sup><\/sup>, Mohamed  S.

One approach to achieve the reactivation of endogenous antitumor T cells is by blocking PD-1\/PD-L1 immune checkpoints expressed on T cells and other leukocytes.<sup> <\/sup>However, only limited cancer patients (15-25%) respond to anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 immunotherapy. One of the most pressing current clinical challenges is to convert nonresponsive, &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors to responsive, &#8220;hot&#8221; tumors. Interestingly, after DNA-damaging chemotherapy, the immune environment may be changed from &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors to &#8220;hot&#8221; tumors by increasing the tumor mutation burden and the generation of neoantigens on the surface of cancer cells. Therefore, we surmised that a molecule capable of inducing promutagenic DNA and block PD-1\/PD-L1 could not only induce neoantigens but also synergistically enhance immune response against the targeted tumor. Using an approach developed in our laboratory termed the &#8220;combi-targeting&#8221; strategy, we designed and synthesized a series of &#8220;combi-molecules&#8221; programmed to generate the promutagenic species and a small molecule capable of blocking PD-1\/PD-L1.<br \/><i>Material and methods.<\/i> Melanoma cell line B16-F10 was used to determine IC50 of the new molecules with SRB assay.

Interestingly, HCC occurs two to four times more in males than females. A possible explanation for this sexual dimorphism is the implication of androgen and the Androgen Receptor (AR). However, previous clinical trials among HCC patients have shown no significant survival benefit after the administration of antiandrogen drugs (e.g. Enzalutamide) that block the Ligand-Binding Domain (LBD) of the Full-length Androgen Receptor (AR-FL). Instead, our lab has developed a novel approach using small molecular analogs of the previously FDA-approved drug, Niclosamide, to degrade full-length AR and its spliced variants within HCC cell lines. The primary goal of this project was to evaluate the minimal necessary pharmacophores for the biological activity of the Niclosamide scaffold. To do so, 23 analogs were synthesized and tested on three different HCC cell lines (SNU 475, 423, and LM3) using a CCK8 cell viability assay. Preliminary results have shown that only Niclosamide analogs with i.) electron-withdrawing groups on the aniline ring; ii) a conserved hydroxy group on the salicylic ring, and iii) a free amide group in the middle have cytotoxic activity. Further work will be completed using western blot to determine if there&#8217;s any correlation between androgen receptor degradation and <i>in vitro <\/i>potency. In conclusion, Niclosamide analogs have indicated promising potential to inhibit HCC cell lines by targeting the Androgen Receptor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Androgen receptor,Androgen,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jeffrey Cheng<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Enming Xing<sup><\/sup>, Shabber Mohammed<sup><\/sup>, Emma Montgomery<sup><\/sup>, Lauren Granchie<sup><\/sup>, Christopher Coss<sup><\/sup>, Pui-Kai Li<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"14e2d3b7-087c-4bd8-b845-81c5fba97658","ControlNumber":"6139","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) is a protein kinase involved in the JAK\/STAT pathway which is one of the 12 core cancer pathways; thus, the regulation of JAK2 is important in the maintenance of normal cell function. A fragment-based drug discovery approach was taken to synthesize novel JAK2 inhibitors based using building blocks suitable for PROTAC development. Small molecule inhibitors were analyzed through computational analysis to probe the binding interactions in the hinge region of the ATP active site of JAK2. PROTACs were designed to investigate the degradation of JAK2 based on small molecule ligands with high binding affinity to JAK2. Pyrrolopyrimidine and pyrimidine scaffolds were used to probe the hydrogen bonding interactions in the hinge region to investigate binding affinity. Modification of A-ring and B-ring fragments of the inhibitors and PROTACs were used to develop SAR through data obtained by functional assays, including differential scanning fluorimetry and <sup>33<\/sup>P HotSpot&#8482; kinase assay, in addition to in-vivo cell viability assays as models for myeloproliferative neoplasms.

The pathway consists of four JAK kinases and seven STAT transcription factors (STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5A, STAT5B and STAT6). STAT3 is the best-studied family member of the JAK-STAT pathway in cancer and is a known oncogene in various types of tumor. Besides its important role in cancer development, STAT3 is also essential in normal tissues. Completely blockage of STAT3 can lead to serious side effects. How to balance the efficacy and adverse effect is a critical issue in development of STAT3 inhibitor. HZ-R078 is a novel selective STAT3 degrader which exhibits long-lasting STAT3 degradation effect in tumor tissue, while the clearance in plasma and other organs are high. Based on this unique PK character, HZ-R078 shows potent efficacy and high safety.<br \/>Experimental Design: In-vitro STAT3 degradation was evaluated in various caner cell lines. In-vitro wash-out assay was conducted in a one-week cycle. In this wash-out assay, SU-DHL1 cells in different groups were treated with HZ-R078 at the concentration of DC<sub>95<\/sub> for 24, 48, 72h firstly, then the drug was washed out, the cell growth and STAT3 protein level were evaluated daily in next 6, 5, 4 days recovery-period respectively. PK\/PD study was performed in SU-DHL1 xenograft model in a 168 h-period. The drug concentration was determined in plasma and tumor tissue at different time points, the STAT3 degradation rate was also evaluated in corresponding tumor tissues. In-vivo anti-tumor effect was determined in two T-cell lymphoma models.<br \/>Results: HZ-R078 can completely degrade STAT3 in various types of cell, the DC<sub>50<\/sub> values ranges from 5 to 150 nano-molar. In wash-out assay, we demonstrated that maintain the drug concentration above DC<sub>95<\/sub> for more than 48 hours can completely suppress the STAT3 level and irreversibly inhibit the cell growth in the following recovery-period in T-cell lymphoma cell lines. This important finding was further validated in PK\/PD study. In PK\/PD study, we also find that HZ-R078 has much lower clearance in tumor tissue than plasma and other organs. The ratio of plasma AUC to tumor AUC is approximate to 1. In in-vivo anti-tumor evaluation, HZ-R078 can significantly suppress the growth of tumor in SU-DHL1 and Karpass299 models in a weekly administration. In pre-clinical safety study, HZ-R078 exhibits higher MTD dose in Rats.<br \/>Conclusion: HZ-R078 is a selective and potent STAT3 degrader which has tumor-enriched distribution character. The pre-clinical efficacy and safety study support its further development in clinical stage for T-cell lymphoma therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"STAT3,PROTAC,Hematology,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yizhe Wu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Xinxin Jin<sup><\/sup>, Xinglu Zhou<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>HealZen Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9b93bb87-86a8-4e09-bba8-2fb042d1cfc3","ControlNumber":"6064","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Only one compound, BC-2059 (tegavivint, Iterion Therapeutics), has been reported to promote apoptosis by disrupting the TBL1\/&#946;-catenin interactions and show promising therapeutic effects in Wnt-driven cancers, such as colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and leukemia. However, recent studies showed that TBL1 modulates Wnt-regulated genes in a &#946;-catenin-independent manner in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Although the involvement of &#946;-catenin is still under debate, TBL1&#8217;s engagement in the antitumor effects of BC-2059 is certain and critical. In this study, we aimed to develop proof-of-concept BC-2059-based TBL1 selective degraders against DLBCL using the Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) strategy and use them as chemical probes to investigate TBL1-related pathways in DLBCL. Two series (N- and O-linked) of BC-2059-based PROTACs were synthesized, and their cytotoxicity and protein degradation profiles were tested in cellular assays. Several compounds showed low micromolar to nanomolar cytotoxic activity. The TBL1 degradation of these PROTACs is currently underway. In the meantime, we modeled the ternary complex formation by developing a workflow where two binary complexes and a library of PROTACs having varied linker lengths\/chemical compositions were modeled by PRosettaC. The protein-protein interactions of the generated ternary complexes were analyzed by Rosetta and the interactions between the linkers and the protein were calculated by Autodock 4. The results suggested that short linkers (8-14 heavy atoms) are more suitable for N-linked series degraders in terms of PROTAC-induced ternary complex formation, while long linkers (&#62;18 heavy atoms) are preferable for O-linked series.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug design,PROTAC,TBL1,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Rui Yang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lapo Alinari<sup>2<\/sup>, Pui-kai (Tom) Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaolin Cheng<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Division of Medicinal Chemistry & Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH,<sup>2<\/sup>Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9dabfbdf-56c0-4672-ac5c-3147187a43e4","ControlNumber":"1853","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.

However, the successful development of these bioavailable heterobifunctional degraders relies on the identification of a combination of ligase recruiter, linker and exit vector that allow formation of a competent ternary complex and target degradation. To this end, conventional single-compound synthesis is time-consuming and poses challenges for selection of degrader components with predictive SAR and ADME properties of the assembled bifunctional compound.<br \/>Here, we demonstrate a high-throughput integrated platform for generation and assessment of bifunctional degraders, incorporating combinatorial chemistry using both commercial and bespoke linkers, cell-based activity assays, and assessment of in vitro DMPK properties (lipophilicity, metabolic stability and experimental polar surface area). Alongside this, we have in place computational methods for ternary complex modelling, linker design and PROTAC prioritisation.<br \/>Altogether, our approach facilitates rapid screening and identification of bifunctional lead compounds for challenging oncology targets with the potential to deliver significant patient benefit. Our platform approach has been exemplified through application to oncology targets of significant current interests and our results in this area will be highlighted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,PROTAC,Degrader,Heterobifunctional,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Roland Hjerpe<sup>1<\/sup>, Louise Birch<sup>1<\/sup>, Alex Brien<sup>1<\/sup>, Lola Cusin<sup>1<\/sup>, Lorna Duffy<sup>1<\/sup>, Benoit Gourdet<sup>1<\/sup>, Rachel Lawrence<sup>1<\/sup>, Philip MacFaul<sup>2<\/sup>, Hannah Mortlock<sup>1<\/sup>, Hannah Neal<sup>2<\/sup>, Christopher Pearce<sup>1<\/sup>, Erica Pitti<sup>1<\/sup>, Gonzalo Robles<sup>1<\/sup>, Edith Rodrigues<sup>1<\/sup>, Catriona Scott<sup>1<\/sup>, Rajesh Singh<sup>1<\/sup>, Stuart Thomson<sup>1<\/sup>, Yujia Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Allan Jordan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Sygnature Discovery, Nottingham, United Kingdom,<sup>2<\/sup>Sygnature Discovery, Macclesfield, United Kingdom","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"25b83861-3d9a-4bc9-a615-c98950e427f0","ControlNumber":"4317","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.
