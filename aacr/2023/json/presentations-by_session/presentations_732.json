[{"Abstract":"<b>Purpose:<\/b> Platinum derivatives are widely used for treating a variety of solid tumours. Besides its direct cytotoxic action, Platinum derivatives play an important role in antitumor immune response, mainly by its inherent capacity to induce immunogenic cell death. Induction of apoptosis using novel therapeutics can be considered a key therapeutic strategy for preventing recurrence and metastasis in cancer patients. Bioplatin is an oral, nano platinum-based compound manufactured using patented innovative processing, based on green technology with an aim of retaining its anti-cancer properties while at the same time reducing its dose limiting toxicities. This compound has demonstrated the property of inducing apoptosis in cancer cells by preventing DNA replication. Since Bioplatin is developed with an aim of arresting disease progression and improving progression-free survival \/disease-free survival its administration is expected to be for a longer duration hence its oral dosing and good tolerability are of utmost importance.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The present study, Phase-I multicentric clinical trial (CTRI\/2017\/06\/008778) was conducted. with an aim of determining the maximum tolerated dose, safety, tolerability and effect on Quality-of-life (QoL) Bioplatin was administered orally for 21 consecutive days to advanced-stage cancer patients of solid tumours who were not responding to any conventional anticancer therapy. Dose escalation was carried out to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> A total of 14 patients received Bioplatin at 4 dose levels, 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg Cohort. The mean progression-free survival (PFS) was 40.25 &#177; 13.47 days. The highest mean PFS of 50.67 &#177; 6.66 days was observed in the 40 mg Cohort. The mean PFS was 37.67 &#177; 16.74 days in 60 mg cohort. Analysis of QoLusing FACT-G showed improvement in QoL (FACT-G) in the 60 mg cohort as compared to Day 1 (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.05). No dose-limiting toxicity was reported.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Considering that Bioplatin can be administered orally, its tolerability, and its property to delay tumor growth, we propose that it can be used for the treatment of patients with platinum-sensitive tumours. Bioplatin has the potential as an orally consumable immunotherapy agent for longer duration. It is expected to increase disease-free survival (DFS) post-surgery \/chemotherapy or as maintenance therapy with other agents in advanced stages patients of platinum-sensitive tumours for improving Quality of life and increasing survival .The findings of the study warrant further clinical evaluation.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Solid tumors,Bioplatin,oral chemotherapy,platinum derivatives,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Yogesh Bendale<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vikram Gota<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rajnish Nagarkar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Eeshani Bendale<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nandinee Khot<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Surendra Nagre<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Avinash Kadam<\/i><\/presenter>.

SaNPs are administered IV to the patient and accumulate in tumors through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The patient then undergoes regional AMF application (300kHz) that is converted to thermal energy, inducing sub-ablative hyperthermic cancer cell death. Based on extensive pre-clinical testing, treatment was proven safe and biocompatible in animal models without any associated toxicities. Efficacy studies in a murine metastatic cancer model, demonstrated the ability to reduce the number and size of metastatic lesions.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> A First-in-Human open label dose escalation study was designed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of treatment in patients (n=18) with advanced metastatic solid tumors. A secondary objective was to evaluate initial efficacy signs. Eligibility criteria included patients with a life expectancy of at least 30 days with measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1. The patients underwent toxicity analysis and MRI scans without contrast media before (baseline), after treatment, and at the end of the follow-up period of 1 month. Vital signs were monitored before, during, and after treatment. Measurements included ECG, oral and body surface temperatures, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> 3 patients were enrolled in the first cohort that received a single SaNP injection of 10% (first dose level) without AMF. No systemic toxicity was observed. 7 patients were then enrolled and SaNP was administered at the same dose followed by AMF irradiation (first dose level of 40%) of the torso area, conducted for two intervals of 5 min. each. SaNP administration procedures were successful in all cases whereas, 3 patients succeeded to complete the full treatment in accordance to the study protocol. During AMF exposure, the patients were covered with a cooling blanket and temperatures were monitored using fiber-optic sensors. There were no significant temperature deviations beside one patient, where a rise in oral temperature was noted due to the presence of dental implants which heated up. In all patients there were no significant differences in any of the vital signs post-injection nor before or after AMF except for one patient, for whom increased heart rate was observed during irradiation, returning to baseline thereafter. No treatment-related abnormal clinical pathology or urinalysis results were identified. Some fluctuations were observed, attributed to the disease stage. Although tumor response was not expected at the first dose levels, MRI and CT results for one patient showed a reduction in a breast tumor and in another patient, stable disease was reported.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b> SaNP administration either alone or followed by AMF application was not associated with any significant adverse reactions, and no clinical or humoral toxicity was observed at initial doses of 10% SaNP and 40% AMF.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Hyperthermia,Solid tumors,Metastatic tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sarah Kraus<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cheri Tal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Boaz Shalev<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Moshe Eltanani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pazit Rukenstein<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shir Arbib<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michal Eck<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Raz Khandadash<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shaul Atar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Arnoldo Cyjon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ofer Shalev<\/i><\/presenter>.

Preclinically, M4076 when combined with DNA damage&#8209;inducing therapy or other DDR inhibitors caused unrestricted cell cycle progression and DNA damage accumulation, resulting in tumor cell death.<br \/>Part 1A of this ongoing open&#8209;label study (NCT04882917) evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of M4076 monotherapy in patients (pts) with advanced solid tumors. Dose escalation was guided by safety, along with Bayesian analysis, PK, and PD.<br \/>In total, 22 pts received M4076 at 4 different dose levels (100-400 mg once daily [QD]); 21 pts (95.5%) discontinued treatment (progressive disease: 11 [50%], adverse events [AEs]: 5 [22.7%]). Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported in 4 pts. Overall, 6 pts had &#8805;1 treatment&#8209;related AE (TRAE) of Grade &#8805;3 (including one Grade 4 hypersensitivity). The most common TRAEs were rash and anemia (Table 1). MTD was determined at 300 mg QD. As per preliminary PK across cohorts, M4076 was rapidly absorbed with median T<sub>max<\/sub> ~0.5-2 h and mean elimination half&#8209;life (t<sub>1\/2<\/sub>) ~2-10 h; exposure increased in a dose&#8209;related manner, with minimum accumulation after multiple QD doses. At &#8805;200 mg QD, unbound steady state plasma concentration exceeded <i>in vivo<\/i> pCHK2 IC<sub>90<\/sub> throughout the dosing interval. PD evaluation was based on the modulation of &#947;-H2AX (a direct ATM target) in <i>ex vivo<\/i> bleomycin stimulated CD45+ lymphocytes, by flow cytometry. Preliminary analyses showed a trend of reduction of &#947;&#8209;H2AX levels from day 1 to day 2, reaching 80-100% of target inhibition on day 2 with the dose range 100-400 mg QD.<br \/>The MTD of M4076 was determined, and target exposure and engagement were achieved without significant hematological toxicity.

We report the results of a phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of PRT1419 in pts with advanced\/metastatic solid tumors (NCT04837677).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Adults with select advanced\/metastatic solid tumors were enrolled. Key inclusion criteria were absolute neutrophil count &#62;1.0, platelets &#62;75, hemoglobin &#62;9, and left ventricular ejection fraction &#8805;50%. Key exclusion criteria were active central nervous system malignancy, significant cardiac disease, and concurrent strong CYP2C8 inhibitors. The study employed a 3+3 dose escalation design. PRT1419 was administered as a once-weekly (QW) infusion. Primary outcome measures were to evaluate dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and establish the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Secondary outcome measures included safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Pts with melanoma (n=8), sarcoma (n=5), esophageal (n=4), cervical (n=3), head and neck (n=3), non-small cell lung, small cell lung, and triple-negative breast cancer (all n=1) were enrolled. Median age was 59.5 (range, 32-78) years, 61.5% pts were female, and median prior lines of systemic therapy was 3 (range, 1-8). Overall, 26 pts received &#8805;1 dose of PRT1419 (20 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> [n=4], 40 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> [n=4], 80 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> [n=15], and 120 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> [n=3]). Most pts (84.6%) discontinued treatment (primary reason: progressive disease, 72.7%). No DLTs, adverse events (AEs) of increased troponin or heart failure, or grade 5 (fatal) AEs were observed. Any grade treatment-related AEs (TRAE) occurred in 80.8% pts; the most common were nausea (50.0%), diarrhea (46.2%), and vomiting (46.2%). Grade 3\/4 TRAEs occurred in 11.5% pts; the most common was neutropenia (11.5%), which was dose related. Due to neutropenia observed at doses &#62;80 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>, further dose escalation was not investigated. BAX and caspase 3 activation in peripheral blood monocytes was observed at 80 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> and 120 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>. Stable disease was the best response observed. Tumor shrinkage was seen in 1 pt with melanoma (10% reduction) and 1 pt with lung cancer (4% reduction) but did not meet the criteria for partial response. At Week 3, mean clearance was 12.6 L\/hr and mean half-life was 2.5 hrs; no PRT1419 accumulation was seen with QW dosing.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> PRT1419 demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability in pts with advanced\/metastatic solid tumors, with primary TRAEs of neutropenia, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.

We report phase 1 dose-escalation results from an ongoing open-label study of PRT2527 (NCT05159518), a potent and highly selective CDK9 inhibitor, in pts with advanced solid tumors.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Key inclusion criteria include pts aged &#8805;18 years; selected sarcomas, castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), HR+\/HER2- breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, or <i>MYC<\/i>-amplified solid tumors; received prior therapy; measurable disease (evaluable for CRPC); ECOG PS &#8804;1; and adequate organ function. Central nervous system disease is allowed if stable and adequately controlled. Pts received a once-weekly (QW; 21-day cycle) infusion of PRT2527 (3, 6, and 12 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> QW, n=3 pts per dose level using a Bayesian optimal interval dose escalation design) until intolerance, progression, death, or withdrawal. Primary objectives were to evaluate dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of PRT2527. Secondary objectives included safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: At data cutoff (30 September 2022), 9 pts (CRPC, n=5; breast cancer, n=2; sarcoma, n=2) were treated in the first 3 dose levels of dose escalation. Median age was 64 (range, 57-73) years and 56% of pts were male. No DLTs were observed, the MTD was not reached, and evaluation of the RP2D is ongoing. Overall, 89% of pts have discontinued therapy (75% due to progressive disease); no discontinuations or dose reductions due to adverse events (AEs) and no deaths were reported. One pt on 12 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> QW had a dose interruption due to grade 2 myalgia and arthralgia; both events were considered related to study drug. All-cause, any grade AEs occurred in 89% of pts, most commonly nausea (44%), decreased appetite (33%), diarrhea (33%), and vomiting (33%). All-cause grade 3\/4 AEs occurred in 22% of pts, including anemia (11%) and hyperglycemia (11%); both were unrelated to study treatment. One serious AE unrelated to treatment was reported (pneumothorax). Dose-dependent inhibition of CDK9 transcriptional targets was observed.

Pleiotropic causal variants with opposing effect on risks for cancer and immune diseases, referred to as an IO signature, were observed in 3 components of the CD200R1 pathway.<br \/>23ME-00610 is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody that potently inhibits the CD200R1 immune checkpoint (K<sub>D<\/sub> less than 0.1 nM). The dose escalation portion of the first-in-human, Phase 1\/2a study of 23ME-00610 (NCT05199272) has been completed and we are reporting data for the first time.<br \/>Methods: Eligible patients were alteast 18 years with histologically diagnosed locally advanced (unresectable), or metastatic carcinoma or sarcoma who have progressed on standard therapies with ECOG 0 or 1. Key exclusion criteria included active autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy and Grade 3 or above immune-mediated toxicity related to prior immunotherapy that led to discontinuation. Dose escalation consisted of accelerated titration (2 and 6 mg) followed by a 3+3 design (20, 60, 200, 600 and 1400 mg). Up to 12 participants were included in a PKPD backfill cohort at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) or a previously evaluated dose level. Participants received 23ME-00610 intravenously every 3 weeks (Q3W) infused over 30 minutes. The primary objectives of Phase 1 were determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)\/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), safety and tolerability. Key secondary and exploratory objectives included pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and antitumor activity of 23ME-00610.<br \/>Results: Between January 5<sup>th<\/sup>, 2022 and November 28, 2022, 21 participants (11\/10 male\/female; age range: 21-80 years) were enrolled and received &#8805; 1 dose of 23ME-00610 across the 2 to 1400 mg cohorts (median duration of exposure: 50 days; range:1-231 days). No dose limiting toxicities, treatment related serious adverse events (TRSAEs) or AEs leading to discontinuation were observed. 14\/21 (67%) participants experienced atleast 1 TRAE; the majority were Grade 1 or 2. The most commonly reported TRAEs occurring in atleast 2 participants across all dose levels were headache, fatigue, nausea and pruritis. There was 1 Grade 3 TRAE of increased blood creatinine phosphokinase. Investigator-assessed immune-related AEs including hypothyroidism, pruritis, fatigue and chills were observed at doses 60 mg and above. The PK of 23ME-00610 were dose-proportional at doses 60 mg and above, with a median terminal half-life of ~12 days at 1400 mg. Peripheral saturation of CD200R1 was observed at doses 60 mg and above, as measured by receptor occupancy on T cells and neutrophils, and levels of free soluble CD200R1. Analysis of additional PD data, including cytokines, is ongoing.<br \/>Conclusion: 23ME-00610 demonstrated an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, with favorable PK and peripheral CD200R1 saturation. Increased immune-related AEs were observed at higher, pharmacologically relevant dose levels.

So far, Treg depletion has not been successful in patients, either because adequate Treg depletion was not achieved or because Teff cells have either been impacted or depleted as well. RG6292 is the first anti-human CD25 antibody developed to specifically deplete human Tregs while preserving IL-2R STAT5 signaling and Teff activity. It has been optimized for ADCC and selective depletion of cells with high CD25 density (Treg).<br \/>MATERIALS and METHODS: Adult patients with advanced solid tumors were given RG6292 i.v. Q3W as monotherapy (S1: NCT04158583) or in combination with atezolizumab 1200 mg Q3W (S2: NCT04642365) in a Ph1 dose escalation study. 76 pts have been treated at dose levels ranging from 0.3 mg to 165 mg in S1 and 48 pts at dose levels ranging from 0.3 mg to 160 mg in S2. In both studies a Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control guided dose escalation was utilized. Data cutoff was May 27, 2022. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses were undertaken in peripheral blood and tumor tissue. PK\/PD modeling applied to Treg and Teff cells helped characterize and identify the optimal therapeutic window to ensure (1) relevant Treg depletion and (2) limited impact on T effector.<br \/>RESULTS: RG6292 has a linear and time independent PK with no ADA detected. A Population PK-PD modeling approach was applied to Treg and Teff cells in the periphery. To predict the RG6292 effects in the tumor microenvironment (TME), the PK\/PD relationships observed and characterized in the periphery for all cell subpopulations were considered the same, a tumor uptake factor of 15% was considered. At steady-state trough, a 70 mg Q3W dose was predicted to lead to 72% of patients with concentration above the Treg (%CD4) EC50 in tumor and 40% of patients with concentration above the Non-Treg (%CD4) EC50 in plasma. RG6292 induced a dose-dependent peripheral and intratumoral Treg depletion in on-treatment biopsies taken 28 days after initiation of treatment. Treatment did not appear to impact the number nor the functionality of intratumoral CD8 T cells nor any evident effect observed on PDL1 expression. In blood, stable levels of all other immune cells were observed after treatment. Moreover, in both studies a marginal increase of IFNg, CXCL10, IL-10, TNF was observed. No consistent gene expression alterations nor immune signatures could be observed when comparing BSL vs OT biopsies in S1.<br \/>CONCLUSION: RG6292, consistent with its proposed mechanism of action, induces profound and preferential depletion of Treg cells over CD8+CD25+ in the periphery and in the TME at clinically safe doses between 35-70mg. Further development of RG6292 is currently being explored.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Regulatory T cells,Phase I,Pharmacodynamics,Pharmacokinetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Tamara Tanos<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin Smart<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Valentina Gambardella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristoffer Rohrberg Kristoffer Rohrberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Ong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Maria Esperanza Rodriguez Ruiz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jean-Pascal Machiels<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Miguel Fernández Sanmamed<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josep Tabernero<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Spreafico<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Renouf<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephen Luen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rachel Galot<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bernard Doger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emiliano Calvo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aung Naing<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Samira Curdt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicolas Staedler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mike Flores<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Enrique Gómez Alcaide<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chiahuey Ooi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Hettich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sebastian Dziadek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuying Xie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabriel Schnetzler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Theresa Kolben<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linxinyu Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vaios Karanikas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christophe Boetsch<\/i><\/presenter>.

It is a glycoengineered antibody by GlymaxX&#174; technology to potentiate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity. DLK-1 is a membrane protein with 6 tandem EGF-like motifs in extracellular region. Overexpression of DLK-1 has been reported in variety of cancer types including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), suggesting that DLK-1 could be an ideal target for cancer therapy.<br \/>Methods: This is a first in human, multicenter, open-label Phase I study. The purpose of part 1 is to evaluate the safety and tolerability in patients with advanced solid tumors who had no standard therapy or were refractory or intolerant to standard therapies and to determine the starting dose for part 2 in HCC patients. The standard 3+3 dose escalation design was utilized in seven cohorts (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 20, 30 mg\/kg). CBA-1205 was administered at 2-week intervals in a 28-day cycle. If the patient had no Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) during 28 days after the first two doses, CBA-1205 administration will be continued for further cycles unless any of the criteria for discontinuation. Serum DLK-1 concentration before the start of CBA-1205 administration was analyzed using the Human Pref-1\/DLK1\/FA1 DuoSet ELISA (R&#38;D Systems, Inc.). Immunohistochemical analysis of DLK-1 expression in the archival tumor specimen was determined in FFPE tissue sections using mouse anti-hDLK-1 antibody (clone DI-2-20, Chiome Bioscience).<br \/>Results: 22 patients with advanced solid tumors were enrolled. CBA-1205 was well tolerated in these patients and no DLT was observed even at the highest dose tested. No &#8805; Grade 3 treatment related adverse events was observed throughout the study periods. The serum concentration of CBA-1205 increased dose-proportionally. The exposure to CBA-1205 exceeded the effective concentrations observed in a mouse xenograft model. No serum anti-CBA-1205 antibody was detected. The disease control was seen in 8 patients (38.1%, all with SD). Especially, long SD was observed in 3 patients with invasive thymoma, malignant melanoma, and pancreatic carcinoma, where progression free survival (PFS) was 39, 72(ongoing, at data cutoff), and 41 weeks, respectively. The serum concentration of soluble DLK-1 was detected in 6 out of 22 patients. Patients with SD by the best overall response had a higher rate of detectable serum DLK-1 concentration and a higher mean concentration than patients with PD. No DLK-1 expression in tumor was detected by IHC method, in 14 patients who consented to use the archival tumor specimens.<br \/>Conclusions: CBA-1205 was well tolerated without any severe toxicity in patients with advanced solid tumors.Part 2 of this Phase I study with two cohorts (20, 30 mg\/kg) in patients with unresectable advanced\/recurrent HCC refractory or intolerable to the standard therapy has been initiated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC),delta-like 1 homolog (DLK-1),First in class,First in human (FIH),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Masafumi Ikeda<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nobuaki Matsubara<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chihiro Kondoh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shose Taoka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuki Katsuya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Takafumi Koyama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noboru Yamamoto<\/i><\/presenter>.

We have previously reported interim results from a Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) study of PRTX007. PRTX007 demonstrated a favorable safety profile with no serious adverse events (SAEs) and a lack of the adverse events (AEs) historically associated with TLR7 agonists. Robust systemic immune induction was achieved, without counter-regulation or evidence of systemic inflammation, in participants receiving PRTX007 in the 300 - 500 mg MAD cohorts.

Herein, we present the preliminary clinical results of the FIH study of SHR-A1921.<br \/>Methods: This is a multi-center, open-label, phase 1 trial (Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT05154604) consisted of dose-escalation, dose-expansion and efficacy-expansion phases. Patients with advanced solid tumors who had failed standard therapy were enrolled. In the dose-escalation phase, SHR-A1921 was planned to be administered from 1.5 mg\/kg to 12.0 mg\/kg (Q3W, iv) in an i3+3 design, with accelerated titration used for the starting dose; in the dose-expansion phase, additional patients (up to 20-30 per dose level) were enrolled to 2-3 selected tolerable dose levels. The primary objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SHR-A1921 and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and\/or recommended phase 2 dose.<br \/>Results: As of Oct 21. 2022, 38 enrolled patients were included for analysis: 18 enrolled during dose-escalation (1.5 mg\/kg, n=1; 3.0 mg\/kg, n=4; 4.0 mg\/kg, n=8; 6.0 mg\/kg, n=5) and 20 during dose-expansion (3.0 mg\/kg). 71.1% (27\/38) were driver gene-negative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who had previously received platinum-based chemotherapy and anti-PD-(L)1 antibody. 4 patients reported dose-limiting toxicities, with all being grade 3 stomatitis (6.0 mg\/kg, n=3; 4.0 mg\/kg, n=1). The MTD was established as 4.0 mg\/kg. Across all dose cohorts, the most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs; &#8805;30%) were nausea (71.1%), stomatitis (65.8%), anemia (42.1%), vomiting, decreased appetite, decreased weight, and rash (36.8% each). Grade &#8805;3 TRAEs occurred in 12 patients (31.6%); of these, the most common was stomatitis (n=7, 18.4%), and all other events were reported in &#8804;2 patients. No patients discontinued study treatment due to TRAEs. As of cut-off date, 10 patients (NSCLC, n=5; triple-negative breast cancer, n=2; ampullary cancer, n=2; ovarian cancer, n=1) had partial response: 4 confirmed and 6 requiring further confirmation. The objective response rate was 33.3% (10\/30; 95% CI 17.3-52.8) and disease control rate was 80.0% (24\/30; 95% CI 61.4-92.3) in evaluable patients.<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>SHR-A1921 showed a manageable safety profile and promising anti-tumor activity in patients with pretreated advanced cancer.

MTH1 protects cancer cells from oxidative DNA damage by preventing incorporation of oxidized nucleotides. OXC-101 (Karonudib) is a dual-action mitotic disruptor and MTH1 inhibitor, preventing exit from mitosis and sanitation of oxidative damage to DNA subunits in cancer cells.

New cohorts were opened following review of safety and PK data by the safety data monitoring board after the first treatment cycle of 4 weeks (w). All patients had progressive stage IV disease with no treatment options in SOC at inclusion. Radiological tumor response evaluation (RECIST 1.1) was performed 8w of the first 24w, 12w thereafter. The first 29 patients (cohort 1-10) obtained an oral solution. From cohort 11 pts obtained 100mg tablets.<br \/>Results: 50 subjects (50% female, 50% male) were enrolled at 16 dose levels of OXC-101 at varying posology: 25-900 mg BID, 800-1000mg QD; every second day, once or twice weekly. Mean age was 52 years (range:20-74). 92% of pts had received previous chemotherapy (mean: 5 lines, range:0-34), 18% endocrine therapy and 52% other therapies (incl immunotherapy). OXC-101 was generally well tolerated and with manageable toxicity for dose levels for an average of 121 days (range:2-513 days), and 43\/50 subjects discontinued due to disease progression. A total of 20 SAEs were reported: 8 SAEs in 7 subjects were considered related\/possibly related to OXC-101 and included pneumonia (3\/8), febrile neutropenia (2\/8), ileus (1\/8), unspecified infection (1\/8) and fever (1\/8). There were 14 dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) reported in 7 subjects. At 510mg every second day (1785mg weekly) 2\/5 subjects reported G4 neutropenia; at 500mg BID\/1000mg QD, twice per week (2000 mg weekly) 2\/9 subjects reported G4 neutropenia; at 900mg BID, once weekly (1800 mg weekly) 3\/3 subjects reported decrease in white blood count incl. neutropenia. PK was robust and predictable with good exposure correlation between solution and tablet formulation, with an average half-life of 10 hrs in plasma. 15\/49 (31% ) of the subjects showed stable disease at first radiological evaluation. One subject had stable disease during 73 weeks on OXC-101 treatment. IHC and western blot analysis on tumor biopsies confirmed mechanism of action. A dose of 900mg (500mg mane, 400mg nocte) twice a week (total weekly dose 1800mg) was determined as the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D). This will be further explored in tumor specific cohorts.<br \/>Conclusion: OXC-101 has a favorable safety profile with an RP2D of 900mg twice a week.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,Microtubules,Cancer therapy,MTH1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jeffrey Yachnin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lars Ny<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Teresa Sandvall<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kumar Sanjiv<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Scobie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Björn Platzack<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pawel Barancewski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Olof Breuer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vassilis Gorgoulis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ioannis S.

ERAS-601 is a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable allosteric inhibitor of SHP2. In combination with cetuximab, an antibody that targets epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), ERAS-601 has demonstrated robust nonclinical activity in human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and RAS\/RAF wild-type colorectal cancer (CRC) tumors.<br \/>Method: FLAGSHP-1 is the first-in-human trial of ERAS-601 administered as monotherapy and in combination with other cancer therapies in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The primary objectives are to characterize the safety profile, determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)\/recommended dose (RD), and characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of ERAS-601 as a monotherapy and in combination with other cancer therapies. Secondary objectives include tolerability and antitumor activity in solid tumors. Presented here are results from the combination dose escalation cohorts in which patients received ERAS-601 twice a day for three weeks followed by a one-week break (BID 3\/1) in combination with cetuximab (500mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>) administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) on a 28-day cycle.<br \/>Results: As of October 31, 2022, a total of 15 patients with previously treated advanced or metastatic solid tumors received ERAS-601 BID 3\/1 at the following dose levels: 20 mg BID 3\/1 (n=4), 40 mg BID 3\/1 (n=8), or 60 mg BID 3\/1 (n=3) in combination with cetuximab. Combination therapy MTD was determined&#8203; to be 40 mg BID 3\/1. ERAS-601 Treatment Related Adverse Events (TRAEs) at or below the MTD were all Grade 1 and 2. TRAEs occurring in &#8805;20% of patients included diarrhea (27%), AST increase (27%), ALT increase (20%), dermatitis acneiform (20%). Grade &#8805;3 TRAEs included Grade 4 hypokalaemia, Grade 3 diarrhea, platelet count decreased anemia (each 7%); high grade TRAEs were only observed at 60 mg BID 3\/1 (above the MTD). Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were only observed at the 60mg BID 3\/1 dose levels and included Grade 3 platelet count decreased (n=1) and Grade 4 hypokalemia (n=1). Pharmacokinetics of ERAS-601 and cetuximab in combination were generally comparable to historical monotherapy PK values, suggesting lack of drug-drug interaction. The evaluation of clinical activity is still ongoing.<br \/>Conclusions: ERAS-601 in combination with cetuximab in patients with previously treated advanced or metastatic solid tumors shows promising preliminary safety and tolerability with reversible and manageable TRAEs. Further evaluation in relevant tumor types are ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Phase I,SHP2,Cetuximab,PTPN11,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Meredith McKean<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ezra Rosen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minal Barve<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tarek Meniawy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Judy Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>David S.

BYON3521 has demonstrated potent and selective killing of c-MET expressing tumor cells in preclinical models, even at low c-MET expression levels. In addition, <i>in vitro<\/i> studies showed that the active toxin can passively permeate the cell membrane and kill neighboring, c-MET negative cells as a bystander effect.<br \/>Methods: Patients with previously treated progressive locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, c-MET positive membrane staining by immunohistochemistry and\/or <i>MET-<\/i>amplified by dual <i>in situ<\/i> hybridization and\/or known activating <i>MET<\/i>-mutation (excluding exon14m), ECOG performance status 0-1 and adequate organ function are eligible for the dose-escalation part of this first-in-human trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05323045). An adaptive approach using the Continual Reassessment Method of Neuenschwander (N-CRM model) is used to evaluate the safety of BYON3521 and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for expansion (RDE). BYON3521 is administered intravenously every three weeks until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity.<br \/>Results: Up to 01 January 2023, 8 patients (1F, 7M, median age 61 yrs) were enrolled. Tumor types were: 4 colorectal cancer, 1 NSCLC, 1 renal cell carcinoma, 1 esophageal cancer and 1 pancreatic cancer. One patient received 0.8 mg\/kg, three patients each 1.6 and 3.2 mg\/kg and one patient received 4.8 mg\/kg. So far, no grade 3 or 4 related adverse events and no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred. Most commonly observed related AEs were decreased appetite\/weight, fatigue, abdominal pain, back pain, vomiting and chills. Typical ADC associated AEs as keratitis and pneumonitis have not been observed so far. Stable disease was the best response observed in 2 patients at a dose of 3.2 mg\/kg. Human PK was in line with predicted preclinical in vivo PK.<br \/>Conclusions: To date, BYON3521 is well-tolerated with no DLTs at the investigated dose levels. Patient enrollment is ongoing and updated safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic data will be presented. After the dose-escalation phase the trial will continue with expanded cohorts of patients with specific c-MET expressing cancer types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"c-Met,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),BYON3521,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>N.
