[{"Abstract":"A subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients respond poorly to clinical drugs targeting defined oncogenic driver mutations. To improve the efficacy of these drugs in drug refractory NSCLC, the identification of supporting therapeutic targets and discovery of the binding molecules are urgently needed. Photoreactive fragment-like probes can discover target proteins that constitute novel cellular vulnerabilities and provide the chemical basis for drug discovery. However, the rational design of the fragment probe library, target prioritization, and sample throughput are still challenging. We applied a structurally diverse panel of BioCore fragments fully functionalized with orthogonal diazirine and alkyne moieties. These probes were used for protein crosslinking in live cells and subsequent target identification through label-free quantitative LC-MS\/MS analysis. High-confidence targets were queried against a pharmacogenomic database (DepMap) and prioritized through multiple cross-comparison with other probes. The top-ranked probe-binding target was validated using a competitive affinity assay, an enzymatic activity assay, and RNA interference. Proteome-wide tyrosine reactivity was profiled using sulfur-triazole exchange chemistry (SuTEx). The tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins was investigated using a pY-100 antibody and western blotting. Using sotorasib-refractory KRAS G12C H1792 lung cancer cells, we identified 932 probe-enriched proteins from panel-wide cross-comparisons suggesting the high potential of exploring the ligandable proteome. We also performed intensive cross-comparison analysis and identified 31 unique high-confidence targets, with glutathione S-transferase zeta 1 (GSTZ1) identified as a unique target of probe 17.<b> <\/b>We found that high expression of GSTZ1 was significantly associated with poorer NSCLC patient survival.<b> <\/b>Probe 17 was validated to physically bind to GSTZ1 and inhibit the enzymatic activity of GSTZ1. In addition, <i>GSTZ1<\/i> gene knockdown sensitized drug-refractory NSCLC cells with KRAS G12C, FGFR1 amplification, and DDR2 mutation to clinical targeted drugs and induced more cell apoptosis in combination with these targeted drugs. SuTEx proteomics suggests modulation of drug resistance pathways leading to the identification of altered KRAS and FGFR1 tyrosine phosphorylation by GSTZ1, which provides a functional insight into the mechanism of drug sensitization. We developed a chemical biology workflow for the simultaneous discovery of high-confidence targets and their binding probe molecules, such as probe 17 and GSTZ1. GSTZ1 was found to cooperate with oncogenic alterations in supporting refractory NSCLC cell survival signaling, which may form the biological basis for developing novel GSTZ1 inhibitors to improve the therapeutic efficacy of oncogene-directed targeted drugs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-04 Target identification, small molecule probes, and libraries,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Target discovery,Therapy resistance,Proteomics,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yi Liao<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sean Chin Chan<sup><\/sup>, Eric  A.

Stabilization of MycG4 with small molecules downregulates <i>MYC<\/i> expression and has devastating effects on many cancers. Thus, targeting MycG4 is an attractive anti-cancer strategy especially since the MYC protein is considered a very difficult target. DNA G-quadruplexes are four-stranded secondary structures and enriched in promoters of oncogenes. Their globular shape and high structural diversity distinguishes them from the thread-like and uniform DNA duplex ubiquitously found in the cell. High-resolution structures reveal the molecular interactions between ligands and G-quadruplexes and are the key for structure-based rational design of new and improved drugs. Here, we present the new MycG4 binder PEQ, a quinoline derivative, and describe its molecular recognition of the MycG4. PEQ is more drug-like than many prominent G-quadruplex binder because it lacks an extensive aromatic moiety. Most of the reported G-quadruplex binding ligands include extended and rigid aromatic moieties with less drug-like properties. We used solution NMR and molecular dynamics calculations to first determine the high-resolution structures of the unbound wild-type MycG4, and next structures of PEQ in complex to wild-type MycG4 or the most commonly studied modified MycG4. This modified MycG4 sequence bears a mutated residue in the binding pocket that is critical for ligand interactions. PEQ binds the MycG4 with a 2:1 stoichiometry and stacks on the G-quadruplex ends. Specific binding pockets are formed in which a flanking residue is recruited by the PEQ to form a joint-plane. The identity of the recruited residue controls the orientation of the ligand and the resulting interactions, as shown by structural comparison of PEQ in complex with either the wild-type or mutated MycG4. Including the PEQ structure, four ligand-MycG4 complexes are now available and we performed the first systematic analysis. We show that despite the dynamic character of the flanking sequences, all ligands recruit DNA bases in a conserved and sequence-specific manner. Moreover, we propose the design of complementary hydrogen bonds to match the recruited DNA base with a drug via structure-based rational design. In conclusion, our work introduces the quinoline PEQ as new lead compound for cancer therapeutics targeting MYC through the MycG4. We present the MycG4-ligand structure with wild-type binding sites as more accurate target and identify important aspects of ligand binding to guide future design of cancer therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-05 X-ray and NMR structures,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"G-quadruplex,Myc,Drug design,Small molecule drugs,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jonathan Dickerhoff<sup>1<\/sup>, Jixun Dai<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Danzhou Yang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN,<sup>2<\/sup>The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7e70e552-ec91-428d-8317-774e93ea2437","ControlNumber":"6075","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

They contain a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain that catalyzes the histone H3, lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) mark at regulatory elements such as enhancers and promoters. Transcription factors associate with stretches of H3K27ac marks (known as &#8216;super-enhancer&#8217; elements) and result in gene transcription that ultimately establishes cell identity and fate. They are implicated in cancer pathology, and small molecule inhibition of the bromodomain (BRD) or HAT domain of CBP\/p300 are considered promising therapeutic strategies for a number of cancer types.<br \/>CBP and p300 are highly homologous but have distinct roles that have to date been hard to delineate, since small molecule inhibitors developed to date are unable to selectively target each protein independently. Additionally, small molecule inhibitors that target individual domains are unable to entirely abrogate the full functionality of CBP\/p300. A bromodomain-recruiting dual CBP\/p300 PROTAC Degrader &#8216;dCBP1&#8217; was therefore recently developed to provide a chemical tool to explore the phenotypic consequences of CBP\/p300 chemical knockdown. A further study demonstrated that it is possible to degrade p300 with some selectivity by converting a CBP\/p300 dual HAT-domain inhibitor into a PROTAC, called &#8216;JQAD1&#8217;.<br \/>We have used a different HAT-domain recruiting ligand to develop novel PROTACs that elicit proteasome-mediated degradation of p300 with significantly enhanced selectivity over CBP, compared with JQAD1.

It is an established anticancer target and PDGFR-&#946; inhibition via kinase inhibitors has been actively sought-after. However, PDGFR-&#946; kinase inhibitors often lack specificity. The PDGFR-&#946; gene promoter forms DNA G-quadruplexes that are transcription silencer whose stabilization by small molecules represses PDGFR-&#946; expression. Therefore, targeting PDGFR-&#946; promoter G-quadruplexes for transcriptional silencing is a promising alternative strategy for cancer therapy. G-quadruplex is an exciting family of non-canonical DNA secondary structures. DNA G-quadruplex within the PDGFR-&#946; gene promoter forms novel vacancy pockets (vG4) that can be filled-in by guanine metabolites such as dGMP and cGMP. This presents an attractive target for small molecule targeting. Herein, we present the binding of the natural product berberine with the unique PDGFR-&#946; dGMP-vG4 binary complex to form a novel ternary complex, the first case observed in DNA G-quadruplexes. Using circular dichroism, fluorescence, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we demonstrated that berberine binds with high affinity and strongly stabilizes the dGMP-fill-in PDGFR-&#946; vG4. Our determined high-resolution NMR structure of this ternary complex in K<sup>+<\/sup>-containing solution reveals a 2:1 binding stoichiometry of berberine to the dGMP-fill-in PDGFR-&#946; vG4. Significantly, one berberine directly stacks upon and extensively covers the dGMP. This direct binding mode provides structural basis for targeting the unique PDGFR-&#946; promoter G-quadruplex by small molecules and suggests an intriguing strategy of designing drug-like, guanine-conjugated molecules to selectively silence the PDGFR-&#946; gene. Because vG4 formation and dGMP fill-in is a unique property of the PDGFR-&#946; promoter G-quadruplex, our study provides a structural basis for rationally designing small molecule drugs to specifically target the PDGFR-&#946; promoter G-quadruplex to inhibit oncogenic PDGFR-&#946; for cancer therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-05 X-ray and NMR structures,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"G-quadruplex,Platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR),Drug discovery,Molecular targets,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Kai-Bo Wang<sup><\/sup>, Jonathan Dickerhoff<sup><\/sup>, <b>Yichen Han<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Danzhou Yang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"712551d6-4752-4b4b-aacc-913ba98efe93","ControlNumber":"5134","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

The Protein kinase Cs (PKCs) expression at a high rate is a key indicator of cancer cell proliferation and survival. In particular, the over-expressions of aPKCs were found to be directly associated with various cancer cells in benign and malignant stages. Several cancer growth blockers (inhibitors) are available for targeted therapy. However, these inhibitors had to pass through rigorous <i>in silico<\/i> screening, <i>in vitro,<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> assays before FDA approval. During the characterization studies of the protein, insights into binding interactions between aPKCs and drug molecules are crucial. For successive studies such as for biophysical characterization, the recombinant bioactive full-length PKC- &#953; (an aPKC) expression in the bacterial system is still a challenge. In addition, the binding interaction studies of aPKCs with inhibitors in physiological conditions providing structural details are limited to some X-ray crystallography structures and computational studies. Here we addressed these two challenges and report a protocol detailing the bioactive full-length and catalytic domain of PKC- &#953; expression and purification from the bacterial system. The further characterization of the recombinant protein by the determination of melting temperature, functional activity, and circular dichroism reported here provides important information on the characteristics of the protein in its native state. Moreover, we show the chemical interactions of five novel anti-cancer inhibitors ICA-1S<b> <\/b>(Nucleosidic homolog) 5-amino-1-((1R,2S,3S,4R)-2,3-dihydroxy-4-methylcyclopentyl)-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide), ICA-1T (Phosphorylated nucleosidic homolog of ICA-1S, [4-(5-amino-4-carbamoylimidazol-1-yl)-2,3-dihydroxycyclopentyl] methyl dihydrogen phosphate), ACPD (2-acetyl-1,3-cyclopentanedione), DNDA (3,4-diaminonaphthalene-2,7-disulfonic acid) and &#950;(ZETA)-Stat (8-hydroxy-1,3,6- naphthalenetrisulfonic acid) to locate their regions of binding on the catalytic domain of the aPKCs (PKC- &#953; and PKC- &#950;). We have utilized the chemical shift changes obtained from various multi-dimensional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiments. Moreover, we have applied the isothermal calorimetry method to understand the biophysical properties of the aPKCs in presence of these inhibitors. The observed biophysical properties of the protein and chemical shift perturbations in the amide backbone of the catalytic domain upon binding shed light on the molecular recognition process, binding characteristics, and atomic-level structural details of the aPKCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-03 Small molecule, protein, and nucleic acid interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Protein kinase C,Chemistry,Drug design,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Radwan Ebna Noor<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Tracess  B.

PTEN dysfunction triggers disease phenotypes, ranging from cancer and PHTS to NDDs such as ASD. The most common PTEN mutations, nonsense, frameshift, and deletion\/insertion, may cause premature termination of translation. PTEN has a considerable number of missense mutations that may result in loss of protein function through reduced catalytic activity and protein stability. To decipher mechanistic details of the mutations and structural features of the mutant proteins, comprehensive computational studies were performed for PTEN mutants at an anionic lipid bilayer containing PC, PS, PIP<sub>2<\/sub>, and PIP<sub>3<\/sub>. Six PTP mutations (Y68H, H93R, A126T, R130Q, G132D, R173C) and two C2 mutations (F241S, D252G) were considered. The PTP mutations are known to associate with cancer, PHTS, macrocephaly, and ASD, while the C2 mutations are exclusively related to macrocephaly and ASD. Our studies indicate that the PTEN mutants can effectively absorb the anionic lipid bilayer, similar to wild-type PTEN. However, Y68H significantly disrupts the core of PTP domain, reducing protein stability. H93R hijacks the substate PIP<sub>3<\/sub>, interrupting the catalytic site residues recruitment of the substate for catalysis. A126T, R130Q, and G132D in the P loop directly influence the dynamics of the loop, yielding a collapsed loop conformation. The collapsed P loop loses the interaction with the WPD loop, leading to dehydration in the catalytic site. R173C and D252G at the interface between two major domains disrupt the domain-domain interaction, allosterically biasing the P loop dynamics. However, F241S in C2 exhibits less effective allosteric connection to the catalytic site than that observed in the wild type. PCA of the sampled conformations found that the macrocephaly and ASD-related H93R and F241S are likely to sample the conformations present in the wild type. In contrast, the sampled conformations for the cancer and PHTS-related Y68H, A126T, and G132D are different from those for the wild type. These distinct structural features seem to correlate with mutation strength and timing of the expression of the genes that determine the cancer and NDD outcomes. The isoform expression data extracted from the BrainSpan indicate that exon 5 is impacted by NDD or non-NDD mutations. Interestingly, PTEN splicing isoforms that do not carry exon 5 are exclusively impacted by the NDD mutations, F241S and D252G. The increased life expectancy of PTEN variants carriers carrying exons 5 and 7 is highly correlated to increased lifetime risk for certain cancers. Our results underscore the detailed structural and functional mechanisms of PTEN with mutations at the membrane, and suggest that tissue-specific splicing isoform expression should be taken into consideration while predicting the effect of mutations in various diseases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PTEN,Protein phosphatase,Signaling pathways,Gene expression analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hyunbum Jang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jiaye Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Lilia  M.

Target ID for membrane proteins is particularly challenging due to hurdles such as poor protein solubility, instability and low expression levels. Addressing these hurdles, recent proteomics-based strategies allow to analyze proteins in their native environment, and do not require compound modification or genetic manipulation of target cell lines.<br \/>Limited proteolysis coupled to mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) is a peptide-centric strategy that exploits structural protein alterations and steric hindrances induced by drug to detect drug-protein interactions, estimate potency (EC50) and predict binding sites across the proteome. Our previous reports (AACR 2020 and 2021) showed the applicability of LiP-MS on cytosolic proteins such as kinases and phosphatases. Here, LiP-MS workflow was adapted for multi-pass membrane proteins which are often underrepresented in global, unbiased target ID approaches.<br \/>For protein targets in the cytosol or intracellular organelles, LiP-MS deploys a dose-response (DR) analysis recorded by incubating cell lysates with a given compound. Here, to monitor proteins in plasma membrane, live cells were treated with the compound in a DR curve for a short period of time before lysis and subsequent LiP-MS analysis. Live cell treatment allows to achieve target ID by 1) locking the receptor in its native conformation to detect the structural difference between the drug-bound and unbound forms and; 2) detecting structural changes in downstream signaling cascades resulting from changes in protein-protein interactions, post-translational modifications or other mechanisms. We evaluated the performance of this workflow using a tool compound (IAX16840) targeting specific G-protein coupled receptors. Our unbiased LiP scoring identified atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3), the primary known compound target, among the top 3 hits. Additional 82 proteins were perturbed in drug-treated samples based on the LiP scores. Mapping the altered peptides on the GPCR signaling network showed enrichment of perturbations in ACKR3 downstream pathways, providing additional evidence of ACKR3 binding.<br \/>Taken together, we demonstrate that the live cell LiP-MS is applicable for target ID of multi-pass membrane proteins. The approach also provides a system-level view of protein and pathway perturbations downstream of a signaling protein (e.g. GPCR), revealing possible mechanisms of its endogenous action. Further optimization of LiP-MS protocol is sought to accommodate different classes of receptors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-04 Target identification, small molecule probes, and libraries,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR),Chemokine receptor,Drug discovery,Small molecule drugs,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Martin Soste<sup>1<\/sup>, Dominique Kamber<sup>1<\/sup>, Nadine Dobberstein<sup>2<\/sup>, Mirjam Zimmermann<sup>2<\/sup>, Aurelien Rizk<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Yuehan Feng<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yaroslav Nikolaev<sup>2<\/sup>, Nigel Beaton<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Biognosys AG, Schlieren, Switzerland,<sup>2<\/sup>InterAx Biotech AG, Villigen, Switzerland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b8027de5-a663-401d-95dc-eb02b0ee4444","ControlNumber":"3826","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.
