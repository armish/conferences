[{"Abstract":"The Cxcl12\/Cxcr4 signaling axis has been shown to promote metastasis in multiple mouse models of breast carcinoma, and has been linked to breast cancer cell seeding, homing, survival, and proliferation at future metastatic sites. The precise mechanism by which Cxcr4+ breast cancer cells escape the primary tumors (which also highly express Cxcl12), remains poorly understood. By using a novel multichannel immunofluorescence (mIF) based methodology for quantifying chemotactic gradients in fixed tissue, we here demonstrate that Cxcl12 gradients in mouse primary breast tumors are concentrically expressed around sites of cancer cell intravasation known as Tumor Microenvironment of Metastasis (TMEM) doorways. Via distance analysis algorithms, we additionally demonstrate that TMEM doorway-mediated Cxcl12 gradients associate with Cxcr4+ breast cancer cells migrating towards the underlying TMEM doorways. Consistent with this observation, pharmacological inhibition of the Cxcl12\/Cxcr4 pathway significantly abrogates the translocation of Cxcr4+ cancer cells to TMEM doorways, suppressing TMEM doorway-mediated metastatic dissemination. However, targeted elimination of the Cxcr4 gene specifically from breast cancer cells, paradoxically results in a suboptimal response, thus suggesting the existence of a bypass or compensatory mechanism. Previously, it was shown that Cxcr4+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) support the invasive and migratory properties of tumor cells that utilize TMEM doorways. We thus hypothesized that, absent Cxcr4 expression in tumor cells, accompanying Cxcr4+ TAMs may still &#8220;read&#8221; TMEM-generated Cxcl12 chemotactic gradients. Indeed, clodronate-mediated TAM depletion results in the significant suppression of Cxcr4+ cancer cell translocation to TMEM doorways and their subsequent dissemination to the peripheral circulation and future metastatic sites. Finally, we used a variety of stromal and immune cell lineage markers to identify the precise source of TMEM doorway-generated Cxcl12 gradients in mouse primary breast cancers. Despite the fact that blood vessels (irrespective of presence of TMEM doorways) were primarily lined by Pdgfrb+ stromal cells with basal Cxcl12 expression, TMEM-generated Cxcl12 gradients were specifically linked to a subset of Cxcl12+Iba1+ perivascular TAMs. Pharmacological inhibition of Pdgfrb depletes Pdgfrb+Cxcl12+ stromal cells, but does not significantly affect Cxcl12\/Cxcr4- mediated translocation of Cxcr4+ tumor cells to TMEM doorways. Overall, our data support a new paradigm implicating the Cxcl12\/Cxcr4 axis during the early stages of the metastatic cascade, and point to a new avenue for rationalized antimetastatic treatments for breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-01 Chemokines in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Tumor microenvironment,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dimitra  P.

Despite our knowledge that DTCs give rise to incurable bone metastatic PC, the molecular mechanisms underpinning their entry into dormancy and exit, remain under-investigated. To address this, we developed a novel in vitro model of PC dormancy as determined by increased entry into G0\/G1 state (flowcytometry) and increased p38\/ERK activity ratio &#38; p27 (immunoblotting). Interestingly, we also observed dormancy entry resulted in the formation of clusters that remained dormant for long periods (21 days) and could be reawakened via serum addition. RNASeq and bioinformatic analysis of control vs. dormant cells revealed PRDM16 to be significantly elevated during entry into dormancy across mouse (RM1) and human cell lines (LAPC4, 22RV1). In vitro, we observed that genetic silencing of PRDM16 leads to a significant reduction in the ability of PC cells to enter dormancy. Analyses show that PRDM16 increases the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins including BCL-2 while inhibiting pro-apoptotic proteins such as BIM and NOXA. Our preliminary data shows that PRDM16 expression in CRPC cells can be induced by BMP7 and conversely decreased by the BMP signaling antagonist, noggin, factors with known critical roles in regulating bone homeostasis. In vivo, we used intrailiac-artery technique to deliver actively growing RM1 cells or dormant RM1 clusters (D-RM1) to the hind limbs (n = 8) of syngeneic mice (C57BL\/6). Bioluminescence shows that D-RM1 remains dormant for more than 30 days. Subsequent histological analyses show that D-RM1 home preferentially to the endosteal niche where, compared to RM1 controls, they remain largely negative for ki-67 and cleaved caspase 3 and exhibit high expression of PRDM16. In conclusion, our data points to PRDM16 as a key regulator of survival pathways during PC entry into dormancy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-10 Tumor dormancy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Dormancy,Metastasis,Prostate cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mostafa Nasr<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Tao Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Ryan  T.

However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for the effects of stress on tumor progression remain unclear. To determine how stress promotes metastasis, we established new mouse models in which multiple chronic stress exposure promoted breast cancer metastasis to the lungs. We found that chronic stress generates a pro-metastatic lung microenvironment with e.g., reduced T cell infiltration and increased extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and neutrophil infiltration. Among them, neutrophils were required for these changes as their depletion abolished the pro-metastatic effects of stress and normalized the lung tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we analyzed neutrophils from chronically stressed mice and identified dramatically altered transcriptomes, including increased expression of several glucocorticoid receptor regulated genes. Phenotypically, neutrophils from stress exposed mice exhibited increased ROS production, and an increased ability to inhibit T cell activation and to form spontaneous neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The stress-associated changes to neutrophils were dependent on glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling as neutrophil-specific GR knockout mice showed no increase in NET-formation, a normalized lung microenvironment and no increase in lung metastasis upon stress exposure. Among the changes in the neutrophils caused by stress exposure, we found that the formation of pro-metastatic NETs was critical as directly digesting NETs with DNase I prevented stress-induced metastasis and normalized the lung microenvironment. In sum, this work shows that chronic stress exposure causes a glucocorticoid-mediated increase in NET formation and that NETs are critical drivers in the establishment of a stress-induced, metastasis-promoting microenvironment. Targeting NETs could be an important strategy to prevent metastatic recurrence in cancer patients, many of whom will experience stress due to their cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Stress,Metastasis,Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xue-Yan He<\/b><sup><\/sup>, David Ng<sup><\/sup>, Yuan Gao<sup><\/sup>, Evdokia Michalopoulou<sup><\/sup>, Shanu George<sup><\/sup>, Jose M.

Osteosarcoma illustrates the need to address this knowledge gap&#8212;about 40% of patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma will die from their disease, almost always from complications associated with lung metastasis, which tend to be resistant to conventional treatments.<br \/>To identify interactions between tumor and stromal cells that facilitate the formation of metastatic lesions, we utilized a niche-labeling system to isolate tumor and tumor-associated cells from mice at four time points during metastatic lesion development. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on the isolated samples and used the resulting data to identify critical tumor-host interactions and characterize the changes that occur in both tumor and stromal cell phenotypes over developmental time. We validated key pathways suggested by the bioinformatic analysis using cell culture, tumor-on-lung metastatic organoid systems, immunofluorescence of lung metastases from both mouse models and human patients, and single-cell RNA sequencing of primary tumors and lung metastases from human patients. We ultimately evaluated the functional relevance of key vulnerabilities using pharmacologic manipulation in murine models of metastatic osteosarcoma.<br \/>We found that osteosarcoma tumors exhibit significant transcriptional heterogeneity. This heterogeneity is conserved across cell lines, mouse models, and patient specimens and is preserved as cells colonize lung tissues, even as the process of colonization drives broad changes in the overall transcriptional phenotypes of both tumor and lung cells. A small subset of tumor cells engages the lung epithelium in a paracrine loop that drives feed-forward production of IL1, IL6, and CXCL8. These &#8220;anchor cells&#8221; survive initial dissemination to the lung, while other tumor cell subsets do not. Anchor cells express high levels of p21 and are hypo-proliferative. Their presence elicits a wound-healing response from the surrounding lung epithelium, causing the proliferation of type 2 epithelial cells and arrest of those cells in a fibrogenic transitional state, quite literally creating a non-healing wound. The IL6 and CXCL8 produced by established osteosarcoma cells act as chemo-attractants for circulating osteosarcoma cells that exhibit a growth\/proliferative phenotype. Cells with this growth phenotype gradually replace the anchor cells as metastatic lesions develop. When established lesions are treated with conventional therapy, growth cells within lesions die while anchor cells survive. Disruption of the anchor-epithelial interaction using drugs that block IL1 signaling, IL6\/CXCL8 signaling, or anti-fibrotic TKIs prevents metastatic colonization of the lung.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-08 Organ-specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Tumor initiating cells,Tumor microenvironment,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"James  B.

This halt in disease progression is driven by cancer dormancy, a stage in which residual disease is present but remains asymptomatic before reawakening and often causes lethal forms of the disease. Cell fate decisions, such as the ones that underlie dormancy and reawakening of cancer cells, often require extensive epigenetic remodeling, which in turn allows for the expression of specific genetic programs that trigger cell fate decisions. Therefore, epigenetic remodeling is likely essential for the switch between dormant and proliferative states throughout the metastatic process. Here we focus on epigenetic regulator, histone H3.3 chaperone HIRA and its role in the proliferation-to-dormancy switch in breast cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrate that HIRA suppression leads to cell cycle arrest and induces canonical dormancy pathways via phosphorylation of p38 and induction of p27 expression. In addition, HIRA suppression triggers induction of stress-inducible transcription factors NRF2, MITF and ATF3 to enable the activation of genetic programs that maintain homeostasis and promote survival in dormant cells. Our data also portray that HIRA is suppressed in the well-established isogenic models of dormancy when compared to their metastatic counterparts. Altogether we present for the first-time histone chaperone HIRA as a major regulatory point of cell fate for disseminated cancer cells by controlling their transition between dormant and proliferative states, and therefore suggest HIRA as a novel and tremendously needed therapeutic target for metastatic breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-10 Tumor dormancy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Dormancy,Epigenetics,Breast cancer,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Stanislav Drapela<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Devesh Raizada<sup>1<\/sup>, Ananya Mukherjee<sup>2<\/sup>, Joanne Tejero<sup>1<\/sup>, Didem Ilter<sup>1<\/sup>, Jose Javier Bravo-Cordero<sup>2<\/sup>, Ana P Gomes<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Molecular Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Medicine, The Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f926394d-addd-44c4-8f73-daa5e42e360e","ControlNumber":"2842","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Galectin-1 (Gal1) is a known modulator of tumor growth and progression in multiple cancer types including head and neck cancer (HNC). However, its contribution to the regulation of metastasis is poorly understood. Through this study we report a previously unknown role for Gal1 in modulating the STING pathway to regulate metastasis. The cGAS-STING pathway has paradoxical roles in cancer depending on the kinetics and strength of its induction, with chronic STING activation being linked to immune suppression and tumor progression while acute activation being associated with immune activation. However, little is known about the pathways that promote chronic STING activation. Using HNC and lung cancer models, we show that Gal-1 enhances STING protein stability, leading to sustained NF-&#954;&#914; activation and heightened chemokine-driven recruitment of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). We show that Gal1-STING connection fosters the establishment of pre-metastatic niche through polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs), which modify the local lung microenvironment to support metastatic spread. Notably, RNA sequencing of MDSCs isolated from pre-metastatic lungs indicate the role of PMN-MDSCs in remodeling collagen and the extracellular matrix in the pre-metastatic compartment. Our findings reveal an unexpected role of STING activation in metastatic progression of HNC and lung cancer models and establish Gal1 as an endogenous positive regulator of STING.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck cancers,Immunosuppression,Microenvironment,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dhanya K.

Previous studies demonstrated that soluble factors modulates cancer-associated biological processes, including cell proliferation, angiogenesis and survival. Therefore, the dysregulation of secretory pathways is a crucial driver of CRC progression. This study aims to explore the influence of the microenvironment on the and the impact of the secretome on tumor biology. Initially, we implanted in immune-compromised NSG mice one representative CRC cell line (highly metastatic HCT-116, low metastatic HT-29 and non-metastatic 269) of a cluster analysis performed on cytokines profiles data of 20 CRC cells cultured in different <i>in vitro<\/i> conditions. Orthotopic and subcutaneous implantations of the cells were performed in two different set of experiments. Here, we found that the secretome pattern of the selected CRC lines was predictive of their tumor growth and metastatic dissemination <i>in vivo. <\/i>To determine if CRC standard care treatment might affect specific secretory pathways and <i>in vivo<\/i> metastasis, we orthotopically implanted again the three CRC cells (n=10 NSG mice for each cell line) and treated the mice with Bevacizumab (n=5) or with a control vehicle (n=5). Bevacizumab, was chosen due to the high expression of VEGF-A in the <i>in vitro<\/i> cytokine analysis and an upregulation in the serum of orthotopically implanted mice compared to the subcutaneous group. Serum was harvested before each treatment and at the termination time point. Tumor growth was followed by optical imaging and metastases were confirmed by terminal ex vivo imaging of the organs. As observed in the previous experiments, mice implanted with HCT-116 cells had the shortest latency and the highest intensity of tumor signal, compared to HT-29 and 269 lines, which belonged to the clusters of weakly and non-metastatic cells. The treatment with Bevacizumab did not influence the metastatic dissemination in the mice bearing HCT-116 and 269, whereas Bevacizumab-treated group implanted with HT-29 showed lower tumor signals compared to the control group, suggesting a sensitivity of these cells to Bevacizumab. Nevertheless, no statistically significant differences were observed in the ex vivo imaging analysis between Bevacizumab-treated and control groups in the different organs. A marked influence of Bevacizumab on tumor invasion <i>in vivo<\/i> was not determined. Future investigations could evaluate the co-injection of human monocytes and\/or the administration of cross-reactive antibodies such as 2G11-2A05 to enhance the <i>in vivo<\/i> antitumoral activity of Bevacizumab. Furthermore, the human and mouse cytokine analysis of the organs and serum will help us to identify key players of the secretome to investigate their functional role in metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-01 Chemokines in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemokines,Metastasis,Imaging,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jacqueline Bersano<sup><\/sup>, Dorothee Lenhard<sup><\/sup>, <b>Julia Schueler<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Freiburg, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"29b75284-b096-4648-9adb-290eca74792c","ControlNumber":"4473","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Increased implementation of low-dose computed tomography (CT)-guided screening has led to the identification of non-solid lesions or ground-glass opacities (GGOs) that are not visible on plain chest radiography and can harbor very early-stage tumors. Growth of the lesions and\/or development of a solid component can indicate more aggressive behavior. Using the low-dose CT reduced lung cancer mortality by &#62;20%, underscoring the need for early detection and intervention. However, the cellular and molecular determinants that contribute to the malignant progression of those early preinvasive lesions remain poorly understood. To assess intratumoral heterogeneity and associated dynamic changes in the immune contexture during early lung carcinogenesis, we performed single-cell RNA-seq and Hyperion imaging on surgically resected freshly harvested tissues from 21 patients (matched solid and non-solid components of lesions and adjacent non-involved lungs), representing a spectrum from preneoplasia to invasive disease. Analysis of &#62;300K cells identified cellular, transcriptomic, and metabolic alterations as well as tumor-stroma cross-talk pathways. Specifically, preinvasive to invasive disease progression was associated with significant changes in the immune landscape determined by an increase in exhausted CD4\/CD8 T-cells, suppressive T-regs, polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and M2-like macrophages; and a decrease in cytotoxic CD8 T-cells, NK cells, and inflammatory cDC2 cells, suggesting that activation of immunosuppressive\/anti-inflammatory microenvironment and suppression of immune activation microenvironment may enable tumor progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microenvironment,Single cell,Immune cells,Lung adenocarcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Liron Yoffe<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Alain Borczuk<sup><\/sup>, Timothy  E.

Inefficient treatment is influenced, in part, by the unique composition of the brain microenvironment. Brain metastases (BrM) grow in two distinct patterns, either as minimally invasive (MI) masses with well-defined borders, or as tumors with highly invasive (HI) growth into surrounding brain tissue. HI BrM are associated with poor prognoses compared to MI BrM; however, differences in the tumor immune microenvironments (TIME) between these two lesion types remain largely unknown. Here, we investigate how the TIME differs between HI and MI BrM.<br \/>Methods: We use Nanostring Digital Spatial Profiling coupled with the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas panel on 5 MI and 15 HI BrM patient samples (lung and breast cancer). This technique enables specific isolation of cancer cells at the tumor-brain interface and quantification of 1,825 cancer-specific RNA targets. Additionally, we perform imaging mass cytometry (IMC) on 119 BrM samples (lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, other) from 46 patients, encompassing over 350,000 cells. Samples represent BrM from various primary sites, and include patient-matched samples from the brain-tumor interface (&#8216;margin&#8217;) or the centre of the metastatic lesion (&#8216;core&#8217;).<br \/>Results: The Nanostring Digital Spatial Profiling revealed a list of 106 and 73 differentially expressed genes in MI vs HI breast and lung BrM, respectively. Gene set enrichment analyses revealed that an interferon gamma (IFN&#947;) pathway signature was enriched in MI BrM and lost in HI BrM, which was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining for pSTAT1, consistent with an &#8220;immune hot&#8221; TIME in MI BrM when compared to HI lesions. Using IMC technology, we identified 20 different cell types, activation states, and spatially-defined cellular neighbourhoods across our BrM patient samples. In comparison to MI samples, HI BrM have lower numbers of B cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD4- CD8- T cells in both the core and margin samples, and lower numbers of CD8+ T cells and regulatory T cells in the margin samples only.<br \/>Discussion: These data suggest that HI BrM invade into an immunosuppressed microenvironment while MI BrM are characterized by an active anti-tumor immune infiltrate. Together, this work suggests potential immune regulation of BrM invasion, which warrants further investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-05 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Tumor invasion,Immune cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sarah  M.

Of great interest, abrogation of myeloid specific TGF-&#946; signaling increased the number of CD103+DCs that displayed elevated TNFa production, which in turn increased IFNg+ production in T cells leading to improved innate<br \/>and adaptive immunity. Importantly, depletion of CD103 DCs in tumor-bearing T&#946;RII<sup>myeKO<\/sup> mice diminished the dormancy phenotype, which was not observed for the pDC depletion in the WT control mice.

As patients age, anti-tumor responses decline, making age a negative independent prognostic factor of overall survival in melanoma. Despite advances in immunotherapeutic modalities, there remains a subset of patients who do not benefit from these treatments. Understanding cancer and age-related changes to immune cell development in the bone marrow can improve patient outcomes. We hypothesize that during aging, the bone marrow niche is reshaped, driving precursor cells to become immunosuppressive. This ultimately decreases the anti-tumor response to melanoma due to the skewing of hematopoiesis to yield decreased immune function. In order to tackle this hypothesis, flow cytometry was used to analyze immune compositional changes in the bone marrow of mice challenged with melanoma. Our preliminary data suggests that when melanoma is present in the skin, there are changes to the bone marrow niche, such as an increase in total myeloid cells. Specifically, in the bone marrow of aged tumor-bearing mice, we see a decrease in Ly6C+Ly6G+ granulocytic progenitor cells and an increase in Ly6C+Ly6G- monocytic progenitor cells compared to the bone marrow of young tumor-bearing mice. We predict that the secretome of the aged bone marrow niche will impact immune cell development by producing more immature myeloid cells that can travel to the tumor site. We also saw an increase in the proportion of CD4+ T-cells in the aged bone marrow when melanoma is present. Thus, there appears to be a shift in cell populations in the aged bone marrow niche when the mice are burdened with melanoma. As a future direction, we plan to investigate the role of the aged bone marrow niche and its secretome on the effectiveness of immunotherapies, such as anti-PD-1. These insights could lead to improved outcomes for elderly patients with melanoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bone marrow,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Aging,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alexis Erasta Carey<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yash Chhabra<sup>2<\/sup>, Ethan Black<sup>2<\/sup>, Murilo Ramos Rocha<sup>2<\/sup>, Mitchell Fane<sup>2<\/sup>, Vania Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Daniel Zabransky<sup>1<\/sup>, Gloria Bravante<sup>2<\/sup>, Laura Hueser<sup>2<\/sup>, Ashani Weeraratna<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore, MD,<sup>2<\/sup>Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5f341743-4d82-4007-b66d-3c65b70caa10","ControlNumber":"7643","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

We have shown that the WNT10B network, composed of &#946;-CATENIN, HMGA2, and EZH2, is predictive of higher rates of TNBC metastasis and poorer overall survival in TNBC. The stroma-tumor microenvironment (TME) interactions in metastatic breast cancer remain poorly defined, and prior to our work, the role of WNT10B signaling in the TME was unknown. Global gene expression profiling of the <i>Wnt10bKO <\/i>total mammary glands demonstrated a gene signature consistent with altered metabolism and markers promoting adipocyte differentiation. <i>Wnt10b<\/i> ablation in the mammary gland increases adipogenic differentiation and decreases the number of mammary gland terminal-end buds, and epithelia to stroma\/fibroblast cell ratios. Therefore, we questioned the role of WNT10B in stromal cancer-associated fibroblast (CAFs) and cancer-associated adipocytes (CAAs) in the TME of transformed mammary glands. By backcrossing our <i>Wnt10bKO<\/i> mice to the highly metastatic <i>MMTV-PyMT (PyMT)<\/i> transgenic mammary tumor model, we demonstrated alteration in the age of tumor onset, changes in the incidence of transformation of thoracic and abdominal-inguinal tumors, and impacts on survival rates.<i> <\/i>Moreover, adipogenic markers are higher and persist through transformation in <i>PyMTWnt10bKO<\/i> mice compared to <i>PyMT <\/i>mice<i>.<\/i> Proliferation, migration, and invasion are also impacted in the <i>PyMTWnt10bKO <\/i>CAFs when co-cultured with <i>PyMT<\/i> tumor cells. The ability of <i>PyMTWnt10bKO <\/i>CAFs to alter cellular plasticity and generate CAAs is higher than <i>PyMT<\/i> CAFs. Additionally, <i>PyMTWnt10bKO<\/i> CAFs lose expression of canonical Wnt markers DVL and LRP and gain non-canonical Wnt signaling <i>via<\/i> WNT5B\/ROR pathways that persist in the KO CAAs. We also observed alterations in chemoresistance in KO tumor epithelium. The resistance to paclitaxel from enriched <i>PyMT <\/i>epithelia from thoracic tumors was higher than epithelia enriched from the abdominal-inguinal tumors. Interestingly, the <i>Wnt10bKO<\/i> TME inverted the response to paclitaxel and the abdominal-inguinal epithelial tumor cells were more resistant than those from the thoracic epithelium. Furthermore, resistance to paclitaxel was associated with higher responses to PRI-724, a CBP-&#946;-CATENIN inhibitor. Neither WT nor KO epithelial subtypes were resistant to olaparib exposure. Therefore, we conclude that <i>Wnt10b<\/i> is essential to<i> <\/i>educate highly metastatic breast cancer stromal cells to promote growth, metastatic colonization, and resistance to paclitaxel.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Wnt signaling,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Adipocytes,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hannah  R.

Tumor Associated Macrophages (TAMs) and Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs) are a major part of this immune suppressive network. Targeting these populations remains challenging. Previously, we have reported that pharmacological and genetic blockade of p38 MAPK impeded the expansion and mobilization of monocytic and granulocytic MDSCs in mouse mammary carcinoma models. We also found that blockade of p38 or depletion of MDSCs reduced tumor growth and metastasis while enhancing the levels of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the primary tumors. In the present study, we asked whether CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells contribute to the anti-metastatic activity of p38 inhibitor (p38i) and how p38 blockade affects the functional status of T cells and MDSCs. By using the mouse mammary carcinoma 4T1 model, we found that depletion of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells negated the effects of p38i on tumor growth and metastasis, indicating that CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells contribute to the anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects of p38 blockade. Next, we examined whether p38i exhibits a direct effect on T cells. The results of the T cell proliferation <i>in vitro<\/i> assays revealed that p38 blockade did not have a direct impact on T cell proliferation in response to &#945;CD3\/&#945;CD28 stimulation. To determine the effect of p38 blockade on T cells <i>in vivo<\/i>, we performed single cell RNA-seq on the 4T1 tumor models treated with p38i and the 4T1 model with p38&#945; (<i>Mapk14<\/i>) knockout (p38ko). This study revealed that p38 blockade by p38i or by inactivation of p38 in tumor cells decreased the amount of exhausted T cells and increased Th1 cells in the TME, indicating a positive effect on T cell functions. Furthermore, we observed a significant decrease in inflammatory signaling in granulocytes and monocytes upon p38 blockade. Our previous study showed that p38i did not affect generation of MDSCs <i>in vitro <\/i>in response to G-CSF &#38; GM-CSF. To determine whether p38i alters MDSCs <i>in vivo<\/i>, we assessed MDSC gene signature in monocytic and granulocytic MDSCs isolated from spleens of tumor-bearing mice subjected to p38 blockade. This work revealed that the MDSC gene signature was reduced in both p38i and p38ko groups compared to tumor bearing mice treated with vehicle-control. These results indicated a reduction in the MDSC generation in the <i>in vivo<\/i> model. Our study revealed that blockade of p38 reduces tumor induced immune suppression and may enhance anti-tumor immune response in metastatic breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-02 Drug targets in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p38,MDSC,T cell,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Priyanka Rajan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Justin Zonneville<sup>1<\/sup>, Robert Zollo<sup>1<\/sup>, Mackenzie Honikel<sup>1<\/sup>, Sofija Raudins<sup>2<\/sup>, Sean Colligan<sup>1<\/sup>, Brian Morreale<sup>1<\/sup>, Mohammed Alruwaili<sup>1<\/sup>, Mohammed Alqarni<sup>1<\/sup>, Scott Olejniczak<sup>1<\/sup>, Joseph Barbi<sup>1<\/sup>, Scott Abrams<sup>1<\/sup>, Andrei Bakin<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY,<sup>2<\/sup>Kent State University, Kent, OH","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f1939f86-ae83-4839-8283-54e543731dcb","ControlNumber":"6980","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

One of the reasons behind failure of current treatments is the continuous evolution of tumor cells and of their microenvironment at both the primary and distant sites, which leads to drug resistance.<br \/>Primary tumor-derived signals such as secreted chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors can alter the host microenvironment at the metastatic site, leading to the recruitment of immune cells and to the formation of pre-metastatic microenvironments which promote metastasis. However, in some cases, primary tumor-derived signals have also been shown to have metastasis-suppressive effects, a phenomenon known as concomitant resistance. For example, unexpected increase in metastatic outgrowth upon surgical resection of a primary tumor has been reported for some breast cancer patients. Loss of concomitant resistance is a barrier to surgical intervention of primary tumor. This is currently being managed by chemotherapy and further identification of actionable mechanisms behind this phenomenon is necessary. The molecular mechanisms leading to concomitant resistance are poorly understood, and it remains poorly defined how this phenomenon evolves over time, during tumor progression.<br \/>To investigate the effect of tumor progression on metastasis efficiency, non-tumor bearing (na&#239;ve) and tumor bearing mice were challenged with tail-vein injection of tumor cells and lung metastases were quantified. Our data indicate that primary tumors inhibit overt lung metastasis by impairing the ability of circulating tumor cells to seed in the lungs. Through time course studies, we found that early-stage (day 7 and 14) tumors impede early metastatic seeding, but later-stage tumors (day 28 and 35) do not. While adaptive immunity, involving T cells, can inhibit metastasis, results from depletion experiments suggest that the observed effect is T and B cell independent. Platelets can bind circulating tumor cells and recruit neutrophils at metastatic sites to facilitate seeding. We discovered that platelet activation and neutrophil recruitment to platelet-tumor cell clusters are impaired in tumor-bearing mice, suggesting that defects in these immune cell-tumor cell interactions might cause concomitant tumor resistance. Overall, our study uncovered that inefficient metastatic seeding mediates concomitant tumor resistance. Current and future work is directed towards identifying precise mechanisms by which platelets and neutrophils mediate concomitant tumor resistance, so that novel strategies could be developed to prevent metastasis.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor progression,Cytokines,Platelets,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Akshita  B.

We validated the accuracy and scalability of SNuBar in cell lines and applied this method to investigate the spatial microenvironment of 4 normal breast tissues, 7 normal adjacent DCIS tissues, and 8 DCIS cancers. The analysis of single cells isolated from 596 macrodissected spatial regions identified 13 major cell types and 43 cell states, that co-localized in different combinations across four main topographic areas. Spatial analysis revealed that vascular and myoepithelial cells were reprogrammed in localized zones near the premalignant cells, while fibroblasts, T-cells and myeloid cells were reprogrammed across broader fields.

One major factor contributing to the high mortality rate of CRC is the presence of microscopic minimal residual disease (MRD) that remains radiographically undetectable and persist regardless of therapeutic interventions. In fact, many CRC patients who have received therapy with curative intent will experience recurrence years later due to MRD, which can progress to recurrent disease that results in clinical morbidity. While immune modulation is crucial for mediating progression and metastasis of primary CRC tumors, how micrometastases suppress or evade antitumor immunity and\/or maintain a state of dormancy before growing into macrometastases remains poorly understood. Filling this knowledge gap requires establishing and utilizing models capable of accurately recapitulating the immune phenotype of human microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic CRC. To this end, we generated genetically engineered, syngeneic mouse colonic organoids using CRE recombinase technology to recapitulate MSS metastatic CRC models with APC and TP53 mutations. After establishing hematologic experimental metastases, histopathological examination confirmed that those present in the liver bore a close resemblance to human colorectal adenocarcinoma liver metastases. We then leveraged our model to test the hypothesis that the activation of suppressive immune cell populations is key for enabling the establishment and progression of MRD. We performed high-plex immunofluorescent co-localization analysis to delineate the immune compartments of micro- and macrometastases. Our results showed that, overall, leukocytes (CD45+ cells) decreased as metastatic tumor foci in the liver progressed. Specifically, cytotoxic CD8+ T cell densities were markedly reduced as tumor metastases progressed to macroscopic disease. Furthermore, populations of CD4+FOXP3+ (T-reg) cells increased as tumors progressed, with an increase in the ratio of CD4+FOXP3+ to CD8+ cells during tumor progression. Additionally, M2 macrophage density (IBA-1+, CD163+) increased as the liver metastases progressed in size. Overall, our findings support our hypothesis, and initiate the first step for identifying suppressive immune infiltrates that may be exploited for therapeutic targeting. Importantly, our somatic mutation-based modeling strategy enables a highly precise recapitulation of the mutational drivers and heterogeneity that occurs in CRC patients as well as provides a valuable resource for research aimed at elucidating the immunobiology of MRD.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Colorectal adenocarcinoma,Micrometastases,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alaa  M.

We investigated the microenvironmental cues responsible for the induction of cellular dormancy in breast cancer cells in different culture scenarios.<br \/>Methods: We characterized an <i>in vitro <\/i>model in distinct conditions defined hierarchically by the following: a) normoxia or hypoxia (1% O<sub>2<\/sub> and 5% CO<sub>2<\/sub>), b) dishes coated with fibronectin or laminin or none, and c) presence or absence of 10 ng\/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) in the culture medium, added on day 0 of culture. Two cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) were cultured at clonogenic densities for 9 days (day-1, day0, up to day+7). The day +7 cells were characterized using crystal violet staining for colony growth (&#60;\/=12 cells=dormant), p-p38\/p-ERK ratio (&#62;1=dormant), Ki67 expression (no expression=dormant) by immunofluorescence, and &#946;-galactosidase staining as a senescence marker.<br \/>Results: For induction of dormancy in MCF-7 cells, under hypoxic conditions, fibronectin or laminin were sufficient, whereas under normoxic conditions, FGF-2 with fibronectin (but not laminin) was required. For induction of dormancy in MDA-MB-231 cells, under hypoxic conditions, FGF-2 with laminin (but not fibronectin) was sufficient, whereas under normoxic conditions, laminin or fibronectin alone were sufficient, but the addition of FGF-2 led to a proliferative state. The detailed results are shown in Table 1. The dormant cells showed lack of &#946;-galactosidase staining and were viable after 7-day doxorubicin treatment (2 &#956;M), whereas there was complete cell death in proliferating cells.<br \/>Conclusion: Specific combinations of FGF-2, laminin and fibronectin in microenvironment induce a state of dormancy in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The dormant cells show resistance to doxorubicin and lack senescence markers, suggesting their possible role in drug resistance and disease relapse.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{CA92883C-E35F-4356-A0C6-D2EAE1DBEE9F}\"><caption>Table 1.

CCOC is chemo-resistant at the time of diagnosis and response to chemotherapy in the recurrent setting is less than 10%. Literature suggests a potential role for immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). However, only a subgroup of patients (20%) responds to ICI and little is known about the mechanisms of response and resistance to therapy. We postulate that a better understanding of CCOC tumor microenvironment (TME) could help predict patients&#8217; response to ICI.<br \/><b>Objective:<\/b> The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between TME immune infiltrate and clinical\/outcome in 22 CCOC cases and identify subsets of CCOC who may benefit from immunotherapy.<br \/><b>Material &#38; Methods:<\/b> We characterized the immune landscape of 11 early and 11 advanced CCOC through a multiplex IHC Discovery Platform. Spatial single-cell proteomics analyses (cyclic-IF) and spatially-resolved RNAseq in 10 CCOC cases using an OC tissue microarray (TMA) were performed. Results were corelated with clinical and treatment outcome.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The percent of CD8, CD4, CD20 B cells Tregs, PD1, PDL1, monocytes and M2 monocytes and myeloid cells was significantly higher in advanced than early-stage cancers. Recurrent cancers were more immunosuppressive than cases with no recurrence. Tumor infiltrate was dense in 4 cases. Four patients with early-stage disease had a high number of CD8 na&#239;ve cells and experienced no recurrence. TME analysis of single case of advanced CCOC (before and after chemotherapy), revealed that hot tumor changed to cold tumor, suggesting the resistance to treatment. Cyclic IF analyses identified 3 tumor phenotype groups in a subset of 10 CCOC present on the OC TMA. The majority of CCOC had high expression of CCNE and high PI3K-AKT-mTor activity, low expression of hormone receptors (AR, ERa, PRg) and low cell cycle activity. Some tumors were also high for HER2. The stromal compartment was enriched in collagen VI, aSMA and PDGFR. The immune monitoring of several of those samples also revealed an immunosuppressive microenvironment, including the presence of M2 macrophages and expression of immune checkpoint proteins PD-L1 and B7-H4.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our study shows that various phenotypes of CCOC are defined by the cancer cell profiles and TME content. Importantly, a strong immunosuppressive microenvironment was detected in many samples, suggesting a potential response to ICI. Furthermore, we detected the expression of several therapeutic targets (MAPK, CCNE, PI3K-AKT-mTOR, HSP90, HER2), including oncogenic signaling pathways (RTK, MAPK). Different tumor phenotypes identified across our CCOC samples suggest that clear cell carcinoma could be subclassified into subtypes that should be treated differently.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Ovarian Clear Cell Carcinoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tanja Pejovic<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sonali Joshi<sup>1<\/sup>, Shawn Campbell<sup>1<\/sup>, Dhanir Tailor<sup>2<\/sup>, Joanna Pucilowska<sup>3<\/sup>, Benjamin Tate<sup>3<\/sup>, Pierre-Valérien Abate<sup>4<\/sup>, Korina Mouzakitis<sup>5<\/sup>, Marilyne Labrie<sup>5<\/sup>, Elizabeth Munro<sup>1<\/sup>, Jenna Emerson<sup>1<\/sup>, Sanjay  V.

The current study aims to characterize the expression dynamics of CD3, CD4 and CD20 lymphocytes from the pre- to post-malignant prostate environment and the association of these dynamics with aggressive prostate cancer.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: The study sample included 72 prostate cancer cases (44 whites and 28 African American) that underwent surgery as their primary treatment and had a benign prostate biopsy at least one year before diagnosis and were followed for biochemical recurrence (BCR). Counts of CD3-, CD4- and CD20-positive lymphocytes were quantified by immunohistochemistry using an automated multi-image processing procedure in pre-malignant benign biopsy (BB), tumor-adjacent benign (TAB) and malignant tumor glandular (MTG) regions of prostatectomy. A cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of time to BCR associated with inflammatory marker count in different regions of the prostate. Clustering was performed to identify similar trends of expression changes of CD3, CD4 and CD20 between the regions - BB, TAG and MTG using Time-series Anytime Density Peaks Clustering (TADPole).<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: The risk of BCR was significantly reduced in men who had an elevated CD20 count in the TAG (HR=0.80, p=0.01) after adjusting for race, age at diagnosis, PSA at the time of benign biopsy and the Gleason grade group. CD3 and CD4 counts in the prostate regions did not show any significant association to BCR. TADPole identified four main different patterns of CD20 expression changes across the BB-TAB-MTG regions namely 1) minimal to no change in expression between the regions (n=45 pairs); 2) high expression in BB\/no expression in TAG\/higher expression in MTG (n=3 pairs); 3) high expression in BB\/higher expression in TAG\/no expression in MTG (n=8 pairs); 4) no expression in BB\/higher expression in TAG compared to MTG (n=16 pairs). In comparison to the reference group (Cluster 1), Cluster 4 was at 3.5 times higher risk of BCR with an adjusted HR of 3.5 (p=0.0184).<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Elevated CD20 expression in TAG was associated with less aggressive disease. Furthermore, cases that had CD20 expression highest in their benign prostate adjacent to tumor preceded by absence of CD20 expression in their pre-malignant benign prostate had the most aggressive disease course.

Melanoma liver metastases are less likely to respond to ICI compared to other sites of metastases, and the presence of liver metastases has also been associated with reduced responses to ICI at other metastatic sites. We aimed to profile circulating and tumor immune profiles of melanoma patients with versus without liver metastases to elucidate the factors behind this observation.<br \/><b><u>Methods<\/u><\/b> Pre-treatment PBMCs from 37 advanced melanoma patients (Cohort A) were profiled using mass cytometry (CyTOF) spanning 46 markers. Expression of specific immune cells were compared between those with (n = 8) vs without (n = 29) liver metastases. In a separate independent cohort of 93 untreated metastatic melanoma patients (Cohort B), FFPE tumour samples comprised of subcutaneous, lymph node (LN) and brain metastases were stained for myeloid and T cell markers using multiplex IHC. Immune cell populations in cohort B tissues were compared between patients with (n=40) vs without (n=53) liver metastases.<br \/><b><u>Results<\/u><\/b> PBMCs from patients in Cohort A with liver metastases had an increased proportion of a myeloid population characterised as HLA-DR+CD14+CD16- compared to patients without liver metastases (p = 0.035). However, a difference in CD68+CD14+CD16- myeloid cells was not seen in cohort B melanoma tissues (subcut, LN, brain metastases) between patients with vs without liver metastases. In subcutaneous tissues, there was a significantly reduced density of T cells in patients with liver metastases (median = 59 cells\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>) compared to those without (median = 217 cells\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>; p = 0.037). This trend was also observed in LN and brain metastases but did not reach significance. In brain metastases, a higher proportion of FoxP3+ T cells was observed in patients with liver metastases (p = 0.003). An increase in this population was also observed in the LN and subcutaneous metastases in the presence (vs absence) of liver metastases, however this did not reach significance. LN metastases also showed a reduced proportion of both TIM3+ (p = 0.049) and CD103+ (p = 0.048) T cells in patients with liver metastases (vs absence), and a similar trend was observed in subcutaneous metastases. In contrast, brain metastases showed the opposite trend as well as higher proportion of PD1+ T cells in patients with liver metastases vs those without (p = 0.033).<br \/><b><u>Conclusion<\/u><\/b> These data provide insights into the differences in the anti-tumor immune profiles of patients with versus without liver metastases; the presence of liver metastases may have a specific impact at different metastatic sites.

Up to 90% of advanced prostate cancers metastasize to bone, and there are currently no curative therapies for bone metastatic prostate cancer (BM-PCa). BM-PCa cells interact with bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts to induce aberrant bone remodeling, which leads to skeletal related adverse events such as increased risk of fractures, bone pain, and poor quality of life. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells that can differentiate into osteoblasts. Cook lab data show BM-PCa cells interact with MSCs and promote MSC differentiation into osteoblasts. Microarray analysis of MSC gene expression changes in response to BM-PCa show significant upregulation of CXCL8. To determine the importance of MSC-derived CXCL8 to BM-PCa, CXCL1 (the murine homolog of CXCL8) was genetically deleted in murine MSCs. While CXCL1 knock out (KO) had no significant impact on MSC proliferation, loss of CXCL1 decreased MSC migration, which suggests upregulation of MSC CXCL1 by BM-PCa cells functions to increase MSC migration into the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, CXCL1 KO MSCs have altered osteoblastic differentiation, whereas adipogenic differentiation was unchanged. RNA sequencing of MSCs stably expressing CXCL1-targeted shRNAs compared to scrambled controls show extensive gene expression changes, including altered expression of multiple osteogenic genes. In vivo data show intratibial co-injection of CXCL1 KO MSCs with murine RM1 BM-PCa cells in an immunocompetent mouse model increases tumor burden compared with co-injection of wildtype MSCs and BM-PCa cells, indicating a role for MSC-derived CXCL1 in suppressing BM-PCa tumor growth in bone. This project shows for the first time the importance of CXCL1 in MSC migration, osteogenesis, gene expression, suppression of BM-PCa progression in bone and tumor-induced bone remodeling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-01 Chemokines in the microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemokines,Bone,Mesenchymal stem cell,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Catherine S.

While numerous changes arise with age, we posit that the accumulation of p16<sup>INKA4<\/sup> (p16)+<sup> <\/sup>senescent stromal cells&#8212;which express cytokines, chemokines, and enzymes together recognized as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)&#8212;promote cancer progression. Indeed, high p16 positivity in stroma strongly correlates with breast cancer recurrence. To investigate how senescent stroma impact tumorigenesis, we crossed MMTV-PyMT (PyMT) mice that spontaneously develop mammary tumors to INK-ATTAC (INK) mice, which allows selective elimination of p16+ cells. Depletion of p16+ stroma in PyMT\/INK mice led to a significantly delayed tumor onset and changes in tumor-infiltrating immune cells, both of which could be recapitulated by treating PyMT mice with a senolytic drug. scRNA-seq analyses of murine and human tumor samples revealed that senescence is restricted to a specific cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) subpopulation that expresses numerous immune and extracellular matrix SASP factors that could impact T cells and Natural Killer (NK) cells. We refer to these cells as senescent CAFs (senCAFs). To assess the impact of senCAFs on T and NK cells&#8217; anti-tumor effect, we depleted each population and found that the elimination of senCAFs no longer restricted tumor development in the absence of NK cells. We thus focused on addressing how senCAFs modulate NK cell function. Together our data highlight how senescent CAFs contribute to mammary gland tumorigenesis by modifying tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Senescence,Cancer associated fibroblasts,Tumor microenvironment,Tumor immunity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jiayu (Jennifer) Ye<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ana Paula Delgado<sup>2<\/sup>, Qihao Ren<sup>1<\/sup>, Robert  S.

Breast cancer can recur in approximately 20-25% of patients months to decades after an initial diagnosis, and there are few biomarkers that predict which patients will suffer from the recurrent disease. Unfortunately, this means clinicians and their patients must take a frustrating wait-and-see approach. Notably, disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) are frequently detected in early-stage breast cancer patients, and their presence predicts a higher chance of recurrence. However, why some patients with DTCs recur while others do not remains a mystery. Previous work has suggested that changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) play an important role in the maintenance of tumor cell dormancy. When assessing the impact of doxorubicin (DOXO), a chemotherapeutic agent often used to treat breast cancer patients, on the TME, we noted that DOXO treatment led to the activation of dormant breast cancer cells in the visceral adipose tissue. Moreover, in accordance with the clinical observation that obese patients suffer a higher risk of cancer recurrence, we found that diet-induced obesity further exacerbated DOXO ability to reactivate dormant breast cancer cells in adipose tissue and this reactivation was associated with robust macrophage infiltration. These findings were interesting in light of our observation that tumor cells can metastasize to visceral fat depots in breast cancer patients. To understand why macrophages were recruited to the adipose tissue and how they led to tumor cell reactivation, we profiled the microenvironmental changes in visceral fat from Veh- and Doxo- treated mice using single-cell RNA-sequencing and found that the infiltrating macrophages exhibited unique pro-inflammatory and lipid-regulatory phenotypes. Our study provides novel insights into how TME impacts breast cancer dormancy and also highlights the importance of adipose tissue as a unique reservoir that potentiates cancer relapse.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-10 Tumor dormancy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Dormancy,Doxorubicin,Adipose tissue macrophages,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Qihao Ren<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jiayu Ye<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiaoyu Yuan<sup>1<\/sup>, Sheila Stewart<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO,<sup>2<\/sup>Cell Biology & Physiology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"17e76cca-8ae6-4513-9611-71d34d438f04","ControlNumber":"8073","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Q.

Preliminary observations and published work has established that metastatic breast cancer cells have increased expression of Miro1 in comparison to breast cancer cells with low metastatic potential. Furthermore, tumors from breast cancer patients with high Miro1 expression have poorer survival rates compared to patients harboring tumors with low Miro1 expression. This data suggests that Miro1 has a functional role in aggressive breast cancers although this has not been widely studied or confirmed in advanced preclinical models. The objective of our research is to investigate the role of Miro1 in breast cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis. We hypothesize that that Miro1-mediated mitochondrial dynamics support subcellular signaling events driving cell migration, invasion, and tumorigenesis. To examine the function of Miro1 in promoting metastatic phenotypes in vitro, we generated human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, T-47d, and MCF7) with Miro1 knockdown using adenoviral shRNA. Knockdown of Miro1 to levels greater than 50% of that in control cells resulted in mitochondria sequestered around the nucleus and reduced cell migration. Additionally, MDA-MB-231 cells with &#8805;50% Miro1 knockdown resulted in a significant decrease in cell invasion through Matrigel coated membranes in transwell invasion assays. Our research has also uncovered altered phosphorylation of key cell migration and stress-response proteins including vinculin, focal adhesion kinase and ERK &#189; when Miro1 is knocked down. To investigate the role of Miro1 in vivo, we generated a novel transgenic mouse model with inducible, tissue specific Miro1 deletion in mammary epithelial cells with concurrent polyomavirus middle T-antigen oncogene activation. We found that when breast cancer formation is induced utilizing the transgenic middle-T antigen system, our control mice form tumors at all mammary gland sites and have metastasis to the lungs. Conversely, mice with concurrent Miro1 deletion and middle T- antigen activation fail to develop tumors. This data suggests that Miro1 has a functional role in both mammary tumor onset and tumor cell migration and invasion, providing a possible new biomarker of tumor status and pathway for therapeutic intervention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB04-05 Genes that regulate migration and invasion,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Invasion,Transgenic mouse models,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Randi Gravelle<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Margaret McCoy<sup><\/sup>, Nathaniel Shannon<sup><\/sup>, Martin Chang<sup><\/sup>, Brian Cunniff<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"fa70f729-25f2-4675-9572-a9a3eeef8882","ControlNumber":"3745","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.
