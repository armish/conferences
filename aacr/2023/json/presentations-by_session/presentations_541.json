CD47 is a ubiquitous receptor that serves as a &#8220;don&#8217;t eat me&#8221; signal by binding to SIRP&#593; on macrophages and is often over-expressed by cancer cells. Despite individual promise of CAR T and anti-CD47 therapies, neither has demonstrated clear efficacy in treating solid tumors in the clinic and there is thus an urgent need to develop novel approaches that enhance the potency of these therapies. We interrogated the potential pairing of CAR T with anti-CD47 therapy to overcome tumor resistance mechanisms inherent to each therapy alone, by engaging non-redundant properties of two arms of the immune system. However, upon coadministration of anti-CD47 therapy and CAR T cells across multiple tumor models <i>in vivo<\/i>, we observed potent and consistent macrophage-mediated clearance of CAR-T cells via on-target, off-tumor binding of anti-CD47 therapies to CAR T cells. This anti-CD47 mediated CAR T cell depletion blunts the therapeutic benefits of treatment and renders the pairing of the current versions of the two agents impractical.To overcome this challenge, we used directed evolution and yeast surface display to engineer a novel variant of CD47 (eCD47) with selective binding, identifying mutations that resulted in loss of binding to the anti-CD47 antibody B6H12, while maintaining the CD47 &#8220;don&#8217;t eat me&#8221; function through binding to SIRP&#593;, which is essential for T cell persistence <i>in vivo<\/i>. T cells engineered to express eCD47, but not native, wild-type CD47, were resistant to targeting by multiple anti-CD47 antibodies but maintained binding to SIRP&#593;. These T cells were no longer susceptible to anti-CD47 mediated macrophage phagocytosis <i>in vitro, <\/i>nor were they depleted <i>in vivo<\/i> after B6H12 administration. We demonstrated a striking improvement in therapeutic efficacy upon treatment of multiple solid tumor models when anti-CD47 therapy was combined with CAR T cells expressing eCD47, compared to combination with CAR T cells expressing wild-type CD47. We interrogated a mechanistic basis for this improved efficacy in an osteosarcoma model through single-cell RNA-sequencing of isolated tumors. We discovered that CAR T treatment led to a large influx of unique populations of macrophages into the tumor, which were lost upon CAR T depletion after anti-CD47 treatment. These T cell recruited-macrophages were maintained after anti-CD47 treatment in the presence of CAR T cells expressing eCD47, harnessing macrophage mediated anti-tumor activity after combination treatment. Thus, for the first time, eCD47 allows for effective pairing of CAR T therapy and anti-CD47 therapy for cancer treatment, by sparing T cells from macrophage mediated depletion, and revealing impressive synergy when adoptive T cell therapy is combined with macrophage activation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,CD47,Immunotherapy,Pediatric cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sean  A.

However, most patients derive little or no clinical benefit from these therapies and many cancer types are notoriously non-responsive. Motivated by (1) the correlation between tumor neoantigen abundance and anti-tumor immunity and (2) that most cancers are characterized by widespread dysregulation of RNA processing, we reasoned that pharmacologic modulation of RNA splicing might increase cancer cell immunogenicity via the generation of splicing-derived neoantigens. We demonstrated that two compounds which modulate RNA splicing via distinct mechanisms, inhibited tumor growth and enhanced response to immune checkpoint blockade in a manner dependent on host T cells and peptides presented on tumor MHC class I. Critical for their clinical translatability, therapeutic doses of splicing inhibitors were non-toxic, tolerated by the host immune system, and did not affect T cell activation, proliferation, and anti-cancer killing activities. Mechanistically, splicing modulation induced stereotyped, dose-dependent &#8220;splicing failure&#8221; &#8212; dramatic intron retention, alternative exon skipping, etc. &#8212; that was consistent across multiple mouse and human tumor types. By combining RNA-seq-based peptide predictions and mass spectrometry of the MHC I-bound immunopeptidome, we identified drug-induced, splicing-derived peptides that promote the expansion of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and trigger anti-tumor T cell responses in vivo. These data definitively identify splicing modulation as an untapped source of immunogenic peptides and provide a means to enhance response to checkpoint blockade that is readily translatable to the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Immunotherapy,RNA,Neoantigens,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>James  D.

Among the underlying causes are redundant mechanisms driving cytotoxic lymphocyte dysfunction. Motivated by the discovery of JAK inhibitors as hit compounds in a screen for the reversal of T cell exhaustion, this study investigates the hypothesis that JAK inhibition could enhance the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors.<br \/>Methods: Murine immunocompetent models of cancer were utilized (A20, EL4, LLC1, MC38). The combination therapy of systemic treatment with the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib with anti-PD1 + anti-CTLA4 was evaluated for efficacy and biomarkers compared to checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) alone. Tumor-infiltrating, blood and lymphoid organ immune cells were phenotyped using single-cell transcriptomics, functional assays and flow cytometry. The combination therapy was clinically tested in an investigator-initiated Phase I\/II clinical trial of ruxolitinib with nivolumab in relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (NCT03681561). Patients who previously failed to respond to ICI received ruxolitinib for 1 week then nivolumab every 4 weeks concurrent with ruxolitinib twice daily. Peripheral blood was collected at baseline, 1 week after ruxolitinib and 4 weeks after 1<sup>st<\/sup> nivolumab dose. Hematologic and transcriptomic analyses were performed on peripheral blood samples.<br \/>Results: The ruxolitinib + ICI combination was superior to ICI in 3\/4 of the tumor models examined in controlling tumor growth. Tumor sizes were reduced by &#62;50% in the MC38 (mean volume 123.1 vs 283.2 mm<sup>3<\/sup>, ICI + rux vs ICI, respectively, n=9 per group, ANOVA<i> p=<\/i>0.0094), LLC1 and A20 models (survival hazard ratio 0.24, ICI + rux vs ICI, n=8 per group, <i>p<\/i>=0.048). Remarkably, we observed a broad shift of tumor monocytes and granulocytes from a suppressive into an immunostimulatory state characterized by the expression of MHC molecules and the ability to stimulate T cell proliferation. Hodgkin lymphoma patients in the ruxolitinib with nivolumab trial exhibited an interim disease control rate of 76% (13\/17). Ruxolitinib treatment in these patients did not impair T cell cytokine production but significantly reduced the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR, mean difference -0.82, n=14, <i>p<\/i>=0.0023) and the expression of myeloid derived suppressor cell markers in monocytes (normalized enrichment score -1.74, n=14, q&#60;0.001) compared to pre-treatment. The reduction in NLR was significantly greater in complete responders than in progressive disease patients (mean -2.6 vs -0.58, respectively, <i>p<\/i>=0.023).<br \/>Conclusions: The combination of ruxolitinib with ICI was effective in preclinical models of cancer and in a Phase I\/II Hodgkin lymphoma clinical trial. Unexpectedly, JAK inhibitor-mediated reprogramming of myeloid cells and the associated enhanced T cell activity may be important for the observed efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"JAK,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Monocyte,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jaroslav Zak<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Isaraphorn Pratumchai<sup>1<\/sup>, Brett  S.

Despite the enhancement of the therapeutic index, when the concentration of the payload in blood exceeds a certain threshold, patients may experience dose-limiting immune-related adverse events (irAEs). In most cases, irAEs disappear when the immunocytokine is cleared from circulation (Ko et al. 2004; Spitaleri et al. 2013; Rudman et al. 2011). Here, we describe an innovative approach to mask off-target activity of immunocytokines by transient inhibition of their intracellular signaling cascade. Small molecules are particularly attractive for this application since their serum half-life matches the clearance rate of the immunocytokine from circulation. L19-TNF and L19-IL12 are two clinical-stage antibody-cytokine fusion proteins that display potent activity by triggering the receptor-interacting serine\/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) signaling pathways, respectively (Amin et al. 2018; Hu et al. 2021). In a first study, GSK&#8217;963, a potent small molecule inhibitor of RIPK1, was tested in tumor-bearing mice with the aim to reduce acute systemic toxicity associated with TNF signaling. Transient inhibition of RIPK1 allowed the administration of L19-murTNF doses which would otherwise be lethal. The combination with GSK&#8217;963 did not affect the selective localization of the immunocytokine to tumors. Moreover, L19-murTNF was still able to induce tumor necrosis and to exert potent anti-cancer activity. In a second study, tumor-bearing mice receiving L19-murIL12 were pretreated with Ruxolitinib, a commercially available JAK2 inhibitor. The addition of Ruxolitinib could significantly improve the tolerability profile of L19-murIL12 without affecting the anti-cancer properties of the immunocytokine. In clinical trials, it has been observed that IL12 treatment can induce cytokine release syndrome and liver damage (Atkins et al. 1997). Our data demonstrate that the pre-treatment with Ruxolitinib restricted the pro-inflammatory effects of L19-murIL12 to the tumor site, protecting the mice from body weight loss as well as reducing blood cytokine levels and hepatotoxicity. Overall, this preclinical work is of clinical relevance, as patients treated with targeted cytokines could potentially benefit from judicious combinations treatments using small molecule inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunocytokines,Small molecule inhibitor,Interleukin-12,Combination studies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Giulia Rotta<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ettore Gilardoni<sup>2<\/sup>, Domenico Ravazza<sup>2<\/sup>, Jacqueline Mock<sup>3<\/sup>, Samuele Cazzamalli<sup>4<\/sup>, Roberto De Luca<sup>1<\/sup>, Emanuele Puca<sup>3<\/sup>, Dario Neri<sup>3<\/sup>, Sheila Dakhel Plaza<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Therapeutic Antibodies, Philochem AG, Otelfingen, Switzerland,<sup>2<\/sup>Bio-MS, Philochem AG, Otelfingen, Switzerland,<sup>3<\/sup>Philochem AG, Otelfingen, Switzerland,<sup>4<\/sup>Chemistry, Philochem AG, Otelfingen, Switzerland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"453edc07-6d69-49c7-bf6c-b8481d1cbe42","ControlNumber":"4426","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>G.

Underlying chronic liver disease due to hepatitis B\/C infection, alcohol abuse, hemochromatosis, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis promotes HCC development. Current therapeutic strategies include surgery, radiotherapy and multikinase inhibitors alone or with immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB). In particular, the receptor tyrosine kinase MET and its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) are known drivers of HCC through promotion of tumor growth, survival, tissue invasion, and angiogenesis. Previously, our collaborators showed that the limited clinical benefit of MET kinase inhibition was partially a result of induced upregulation PD-L1 leading to local T cell suppression. We hypothesized that combining MET inhibition with blockade of the PD-1 immune checkpoint would overcome the limitations of each individual approach and act synergistically to promote HCC tumor regression. We first validated that both MET selective (Capmatinib and Tivantinib) and non-selective (Cabozantinib) inhibitors all induced PD-L1 on HCC cell lines in vitro. Next, we compared Capmatinib and Cabozantinib alone and with PD-1 ICB in vivo in the ICB-sensitive Hepa1-6 and HCA-1 models of HCC. In HCA-1, statistically significant benefit of the MET inhibitor and &#945;PD-1 combination was evident in limitation of tumor growth and extension of survival. In each case, the Capmatinib combination trended toward better outcomes with PD-1 blockade. Mechanistically, the Capmatinib and &#945;PD-1 combination decreased tumor Treg cells while promoting increased accumulation of activated, non-exhausted, proliferating CD8 T cells. Central memory CD8 T cell frequencies were increased by the combination during the effector phase, and combination treated animals were better protected against subsequent rechallenge than those cured by &#945;PD-1 alone. In the myeloid compartment, M1 macrophage frequencies were increased while PMN-MDSC both decreased in frequency and in Arginase 1 levels. Finally, we studied a serially-passaged, &#945;PD-1 refractory DEN HCC model. Despite lack of efficacy of either component therapy, the MET inhibitor and &#945;PD-1 combination significantly extended survival and inhibited tumor growth. As in the &#945;PD-1 sensitive setting, Capmatinib appeared to offer the most therapeutic benefit with &#945;PD-1. Ongoing studies are focused on characterizing changes mediated by the combination therapy which confer aPD-1 sensitivity to the otherwise refractory DEN HCC tumor microenvironment. Molecular studies are focused on understanding the superior ICB potentiating capacity of Type I MET inhibitors versus the other classes. Given the clinical availability of numerous MET and PDL-1 inhibitors, we hope to inform near-term optimization of MET and &#945;PD-1 clinical trial design for HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Combination therapy,Mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET),Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ricardo  A.  de Azevedo<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Broderick Turner<sup><\/sup>, Priyamvada Jayaprakash<sup><\/sup>, Krithikaa Rajkumar Bhanu<sup><\/sup>, Anupallavi Srinivasamani<sup><\/sup>, Brittany Morrow<sup><\/sup>, Michelle Winkler<sup><\/sup>, Shweta Mahendra Hedge<sup><\/sup>, Arthur Liu<sup><\/sup>, Ravaen Slay<sup><\/sup>, Michael  A.

The T-SIGn (Tumor Specific ImmunoGene) platform generates viral vectors that can produce combinations of transgenes selectively within the tumor microenvironment (TME). T-SIGn is clinically validated for intravenous (i.v.) delivery, enabling vectors to reach primary and metastatic sites to produce their therapeutic payloads specifically in malignant epithelial cells. Using an A549 human tumor xenograft and metastasis model, we previously demonstrated that i.v. administration of a T-SIGn vector encoding IFN&#945;, MIP1&#945; and CD80 results into potentiated CAR-T cell activation and therapy efficacy (Sonzogni et al. 2022). Here, we further evaluated the potential of T-SIGn combination with Cell Therapy by investigating the impact on CAR-T cell activity of vectors encoding different arrays of cytokines and chemokines. Using an <i>in vivo<\/i> A549 model and anti-HER2 CAR-T cells in NSG mice, we demonstrated that T-SIGn vectors can enable effective CAR-T cell therapy against solid tumors by providing diverse localized cytokine\/chemokine-mediated T cell boosting, with IL-12-encoding vectors resulting in complete and durable tumor clearance. Furthermore, we explored the use of the T-SIGn platform to encode secreted bispecific &#8220;adaptor&#8221; molecules able to simultaneously bind to a tumor surface antigen and to a CAR specific for an antigen not naturally expressed by the tumor, allowing the redirection of CAR-T cells against desired tumor types. We designed a vector (NG-1125) encoding an anti-HER2 ScFv_CD19 bispecific construct as a model &#8220;adaptor&#8221; molecule, together with IFN&#945; and CXCL9, and we showed that this construct can effectively redirect anti-CD19 CAR-T cell against HER2<sup>+<\/sup>CD19<sup>-<\/sup> tumor cells. <i>In vitro<\/i> X-CELLigence-based cytotoxicity assays demonstrated killing of both HER2<sup>+<\/sup>CD19<sup>-<\/sup> A549 and SKOV3 cells by anti-CD19 CAR-T cells in presence of vector-derived anti-HER2 ScFv_CD19. Following i.v. NG-1125 dosing of A549 tumor-bearing mice, <i>ex vivo<\/i> flow cytometry analysis of tumor masses revealed binding of the encoded adaptor molecule to both vector-infected and uninfected tumor cells. Furthermore, <i>in vivo<\/i> NG-1125 administration together with anti-CD19 CAR-T cells resulted into increased intra-tumoral densities of transferred T cells. Collectively, these data show the potential of T-SIGn vectors in overcoming solid tumor resistance mechanisms to CAR-T and pave the way for the development of other immunotherapeutics to be expressed within the TME via T-SIGn vectors in combination with CAR or TCR-based therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,CAR T cells,Gene therapy,Tumor targeting,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maria Stella Sasso<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Rachel Bergin<sup><\/sup>, Rochelle Lear<sup><\/sup>, Darren Plumb<sup><\/sup>, Manuela Zonca<sup><\/sup>, Eva Vainiute<sup><\/sup>, Meg Snowden<sup><\/sup>, Tae Hyun Jang<sup><\/sup>, Alice Muntzer<sup><\/sup>, Carla  C.

Yet, the induction and maintenance of functional tumor antigen specific T cell responses represent still one of the greatest challenges in cancer immunotherapy.<br \/>Therapeutic cancer vaccines based on engineered arenavirus vectors have been shown preclinically to overcome self-tolerance to tumor associated antigens (TAA) and mount unprecedented T cell responses, both, in preclinical tumor models as well as HPV16+ cancer patients in an ongoing Phase 1\/2 trial. The novel PD-1 targeted IL-2 variant (PD1-IL2v) was created to maximize the potency of IL-2R activation of effector T cells while overcoming the toxicities of wildtype IL-2. <i>Cis<\/i> binding of PD1-IL2v to PD-1 and IL-2R&#946;&#947; on the same cell was recently shown to promote differentiation of stem-like CD8 T cells into better effectors and was therefore identified as an ideal compound for combination therapies with arenavirus vectors. Combination of vectors encoding tumor associated foreign or self-antigens with PD1-IL2v lead to a massive, up to 60-fold, increase of peripheral tumor specific CD8 T cell numbers compared to vector treatment alone. Notably, frequency of peripheral regulatory T cells was not enhanced by this combination. The massive increase of TAA specific CD8 T cells was associated with synergistic anti-tumor efficacy in two independent tumor models, resulting in longer survival times and up to 60% complete responders. Complete tumor clearance resulted in a stable memory T cell population and protection against tumor re-challenge. Ongoing studies will address modifications of the tumor microenvironment and further characterization of tumor infiltrating T cells upon combination therapy.<br \/>These preclinical data establish the combination of arenavirus vectors and PD1-IL2v as a promising next generation cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,Cancer vaccine,Immunocytokines,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Judith Strauss<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Diana Reckendorfer<sup>1<\/sup>, Kimberly Pojar<sup>1<\/sup>, Laura Codarri Deak<sup>2<\/sup>, Valeria Nicolini<sup>2<\/sup>, Roger Sutmuller<sup>2<\/sup>, Christian Klein<sup>2<\/sup>, Pablo Umaña<sup>2<\/sup>, Klaus  K.
