In preclinical CLL models, VAY736 showed antileukemic activity and, when combined with ibrutinib, significantly reduced disease burden, which may allow some pts to discontinue ibrutinib.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> This Phase Ib dose-escalation (ESC)\/-expansion (EXP) trial (NCT03400176) enrolled pts with CLL who did not achieve a complete response (CR) after &#62;1 year of ibrutinib or had developed a resistance mutation to ibrutinib. Pts received IV VAY736 (ESC: 0.3-9 mg\/kg; EXP: 3 mg\/kg) once every 2 weeks and oral ibrutinib (420 mg) once daily for up to 8 28-day cycles. Pts achieving undetectable MRD (uMRD) at C9D1 could discontinue ibrutinib at investigator discretion. The study aimed to characterize the safety and tolerability of VAY736 + ibrutinib, assess antitumor activity, PK, and characterize PD profiles.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> By Jul 29, 2022, 39 pts were enrolled (ESC: n=15; EXP: n=24). <b>Table 1<\/b> shows pt characteristics, safety, and efficacy data. The overall response at C9D1 for 37 evaluable pts was 40.5% CR + CRi and 16.2% PR (1L: 63.6% CR + CRi and 18.2% PR). At C9D1, 17 pts (45.9%) had uMRD in blood or bone marrow (BM). In the 2-year follow-up period, 16 pts discontinued ibrutinib and were off therapy for 4.9-19.8 months. Frequency of peripheral NKp46+ NK cells increased at least 50% after VAY736 in over 50% of pts. Preliminary coverage-based limiting-cell experiment analysis of RNAseq (CLEAR) data from 10 pts supports peripheral NK cell activation with VAY736.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b> VAY736 + ibrutinib appears highly active and has an acceptable safety profile. Multiple pts attained uMRD in blood or BM. Biomarker data suggest NK cell activation with VAY736. More pts will be included in the RNAseq analysis at presentation. Future development of VAY736 for CLL is strongly indicated based on these promising data.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{C877EF1E-328F-4AD0-BE10-A6A23B0477B4}\"><caption>Table 1.

Lancet Oncol 2020, Duell J, et al. Haematologica 2021). Here, we report the final, 5-year follow-up of L-MIND. Data cut-off was Nov 14, 2022.<br \/>Methods: Pts were aged &#8805;18 years with ASCT-ineligible R\/R DLBCL, 1-3 prior systemic therapies (including a CD20-targeting regimen), and ECOG PS 0-2. Tafasitamab (12 mg\/kg) was given for up to 12 cycles in combination with LEN (25 mg), then as monotherapy until disease progression (PD) or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was best objective response rate (ORR; complete response [CR] or partial response [PR], by independent radiology committee). Secondary endpoints included duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs). Exploratory analyses evaluated efficacy endpoints by prior lines of therapy (pLoT).<br \/>Results: Of 81 pts enrolled, 80 were treated (full analysis set [FAS]). The ORR (FAS) of 57.5% [95% CI: 45.9-68.5], with CR of 41.2% [30.4-51.6] (n=33) and PR of 16.2% [8.9-26.2] (n=13), was generally consistent with the primary and 3-year analyses. Median DoR was not reached (NR) with median follow up (mFU) of 44.0 months [29.9-57.0]. Median PFS was 11.6 months [5.7-45.7] (mFU 45.6 [22.9-57.6]) and median OS was 33.5 months [18.3-NR] (mFU 65.6 [59.9-70.3]). At data cut-off, OS was &#62;60 months in 21 pts (18 with best response of CR, 1 PR, 1 stable disease and 1 PD), including 14 with 1 pLoT and 7 with &#8805;2 pLoT. Pts with 1 pLoT (n=40) in the FAS had higher ORR (67.5%; 52.5% CR [n=21] and 15% PR [n=6]) compared to pts with &#8805;2 pLoT (n=40; 47.5%; 30% CR [n=12] and 17.5% PR [n=7]). However, median DoR was not reached for both subgroups, indicating similar long-term efficacy for responders. AEs were consistent with previous reports and manageable; incidence declined after transition from combination to tafasitamab monotherapy and again with monotherapy &#62;2 years.<br \/>Conclusion: The final, 5-year analysis of L-MIND showed prolonged durable responses with tafasitamab + LEN combination therapy, followed by long-term tafasitamab monotherapy, in pts with R\/R DLBCL ineligible for ASCT, with median DoR not reached after 44 months mFU. No new safety signals were identified, confirming the tolerability profile observed with earlier data cuts. These long-term data suggest that this immunotherapy may have curative potential that is being explored in further studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL03-01  Placeholder Abstracts: Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD19,Targeted therapy,Immunotherapy,Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Johannes Duell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pau Abrisqueta<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marc Andre<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marinela Augustin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gianluca Gaidano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva González Barca<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wojciech Jurczak<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Nagesh Kalakonda<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna Marina Liberati<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kami J.

Engineering na&#239;ve\/memory T (T<sub>N\/MEM<\/sub>) cells with a bispecific anti-CD19\/CD20 CAR could improve outcomes by mitigating these limitations. Here we report an update of the first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial with T<sub>N\/MEM<\/sub> cells expressing a bispecific anti-CD19\/CD20 CAR (CART19\/20) for patients with R\/R NHL (NCT04007029). Eligible patients were &#8805;18 years old with R\/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) after &#8805;2 prior lines of therapy, or with mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), or CLL\/SLL after &#8805;3 prior lines of therapy. Prior CAR-T cell therapy was excluded, but other forms of CD19- or CD20-targeted therapies were allowed. Autologous leukocytes were obtained by leukapheresis and sorted for CD14-\/CD25-\/CD62L+ T<sub>N\/MEM<\/sub> cells, followed by lentiviral transduction of the bispecific CD19\/CD20 CAR. Bridging therapy after leukapheresis was allowed. Lymphodepletion chemotherapy with fludarabine 30 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>\/day and cyclophosphamide 500 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>\/day was administered for 3 days from Day &#8722;5 to Day &#8722;3 prior to CAR-T cell infusion. The primary endpoint was safety and the secondary endpoints were ORR, progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and CART19\/20 transgene persistence. As of December 19, 2022, 11 patients have been treated with CART19\/20 cells (7 DLBCL, including 4 transformed FL and 1 PMBCL; 3 FL; and 1 MCL). Patients were enrolled at two dose levels, including 50 x 10<sup>6 <\/sup>CAR+ cells (8 patients) and 200 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> CAR+ cells (3 patients). The median age was 58 (range: 34 to 70). All patients had stage IV disease and 9 of 11 patients received bridging therapy. Six patients had grade-1 cytokine release syndrome (CRS), without any occurrence of higher-grade CRS. Neurotoxicity was not observed. Ten of the 11 patients achieved an objective response (91% ORR), with 8 patients (73%) achieving complete response (CR). One patient with FL relapsed at 18 months, received a second CART19\/20 cell infusion (112 x 10<sup>6 <\/sup>CAR+ cells), and re-achieved a CR that has persisted for &#62;6 months at last follow-up. With a median follow-up of 20.9 months (range: 3.4 - 37 months), 7 patients remain in CR with a median PFS of 18.2 months (95% CI 3.4 months - not estimable) and the median OS was not reached. This phase 1 study demonstrates robust safety and tolerability of CART19\/20 T-cells in patients with R\/R NHL, without occurrence of severe CRS or neurotoxicity. CART19\/20 cells, utilizing a bispecific CAR and T<sub>N\/MEM <\/sub>cells, may be an effective strategy to overcome the challenges of poor CAR T-cell persistence and antigen escape.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,CD19,CD20,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Benjamin R.

AFM13 is a tetravalent, bispecific Innate Cell Engager (ICE<b><sup>&#174;<\/sup><\/b>) that binds CD30 when expressed on PTCL cells, and CD16A on innate effector cells, redirecting and enhancing the innate immune response to CD30<sup>+<\/sup> tumor cells. Phase 1 clinical studies of AFM13 in patients with R\/R Hodgkin lymphoma and cutaneous CD30<sup>+<\/sup> lymphomas showed a tolerable safety profile and clinical activity; early correlative science data in a small group of patients with HL showed increased natural killer (NK) cell activity in responsive patients. A Phase 2, open-label, multi-cohort study (NCT04101331) assessing the efficacy of AFM13 in patients with R\/R PTCL was initiated in 2019. Patients had histologically confirmed CD30 expression in &#8805;1% of tumor cells and had received &#8805;1 prior systemic therapy. The primary endpoint was to assess the overall response rate (ORR) based on FDG-PET per independent review committee. Secondary endpoints included safety, complete response rate (CRR), duration of response (DoR), pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and quality of life. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were exploratory endpoints. Patients received 200 mg AFM13 intravenously once weekly until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, termination at the investigator&#8217;s discretion, or withdrawal of consent. A total of 108 patients (age 21-93; 61% male) received AFM13, with a median (min, max) number of infusions of 9.0 (1, 116). Numbers of patients per PTCL subtype assessed were: PTCL not&#8209;otherwise&#8209;specified (PTCL-NOS), 41; angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL), 30; anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), 26; other, 11. Patients received a mean number of 2.7 prior treatment lines; 46.3% received prior brentuximab vedotin (BV), 17.6% received prior auto-transplant. The ORR was 32.4% (CRR was 10.2%); ORR in each subgroup was 22.0% (PTCL-NOS), 53.3% (AITL), 23.1% (ALCL), and 36.4% (other). Median DoR, PFS, and OS were 2.3 months, 3.5 months, and 13.8 months, respectively. Reported treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were as anticipated based on previous studies. AFM13-related TEAEs occurred in 79\/108 patients (73.1%), with 14 events in 9 patients (8%) considered serious. The most frequent TEAE was infusion&#8209;related reactions, observed in 34\/108 patients (31.5%), including 12 Grade 3 events in 6 patients (5.7%). Neutropenia was the most frequent TEAE with Grade &#8805;3 occurring in 9.3% of patients. AFM13 monotherapy was well managed and showed robust clinical activity in selected R\/R PTCL subtypes. These data, together with encouraging preliminary efficacy seen in AFM13 combination studies in HL, support further evaluation of AFM13 in combination with NK cells to augment the innate immune response to CD30+ tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,Solid tumors,Immune cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Won Seog Kim<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jake Shortt<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pier Luigi Zinzani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natalya Mikhaylova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ana Marin-Niebla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dejan Radeski<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vincent Ribrag<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva Domingo Domenech<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ahmed Sawas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Karenza Alexis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Emig<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Linta Garcia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andre Overesch<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kerstin Pietzko<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven Horwitz<\/i><\/presenter>.

Despite the approval of midostaurin and gilteritinib, the prognosis for FLT3+ patients with relapsed or refractory disease is poor. NMS-088 is a novel, potent FLT3, KIT and CSF1R inhibitor with superior preclinical activity compared with approved FLT3 inhibitors in different FLT3-driven models. In addition, NMS-088 is active on FLT3 resistance mutation F691L. Dose escalation results from a Phase I\/II study to establish safety, dose selection and preliminary clinical activity for NMS-088 in patients with R\/R AML and CMML are described.<br \/>Methods: In the Phase I 3+3 escalations, NMS-088 is administered daily for 21 of 28 days (schedule A) or continuously (schedule B). Patients must have R\/R AML or CMML unsuitable for standard therapy. The primary objective is the MTD or MAD as assessed by DLTs. Secondary endpoints include safety, PK and ELN response.<br \/>Results: as of January 26, 44 R\/R AML or CMML patients were treated at doses from 20 to 360 mg\/day in A or from 120 to 250 mg\/day in B. Median age was 64 yrs, 41 pts had AML and 3 pts had CMML, median number of prior lines was 2 (range 1 to 10). FLT3 mutations were present in 24 out of 41 AML pts (20 FLT3-ITD, 2 FLT3 D835 and 2 FLT3-ITD and D835). The majority of pts with FLT3+ AML had received prior FLT3 inhibitors (86.4%). NMS-088 showed manageable safety with no MTD characterized. One pt had DLT (abnormal posture, decreased activity, dyspnea G3 and eyelid ptosis G1) at 360 mg in A (at day 21) and one pt had DLT (eyelid ptosis G3) at 180 mg in B (at day 29), both suggestive for myasthenic syndrome. Three additional pts experienced possible myasthenic syndrome at doses &#8805; 180 mg. Overall the most frequent treatment emergent related adverse events (&#8805;10%) were nausea (any grade 20.5%), vomiting (13.6%), asthenia (11.4%). Discontinuations due to related AEs were as follows: 2 DLT pts per protocol, 2 pts due to nausea (G1; day 161 at 270 mg) and myasthenia gravis (G3; day 39 at 300 mg in a pt with baseline AChR antibodies). There was a dose-dependent trend for response. A total of 5 out of 12 evaluable pts with FLT3+ AML treated at dose &#8805; 300 mg achieved an investigator-assessed response with 3 CRi, and 2 MLFS. Remarkably, all these pts had received prior midostaurin and 2 pts received both midostaurin and gilteritinib. Two pts with response withdrew from treatment to receive HSCT (DoR 1.0+ mos each). For other responding pts DoR was 1.3, 2.8 and 7.9 mos.<br \/>Conclusions: NMS-088 showed clinical efficacy in pts with FLT3+ R\/R AML, including pts who have failed prior FLT3 inhibitors.

LY3410738 binds covalently at a novel binding site, enabling continued potency in preclinical models in the setting of second site IDH resistance mutations. We present initial results from the first-in-human phase 1 dose escalation study of oral LY3410738 in patients (pts) with R\/R IDH1\/2m hematologic cancers.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Dose escalation (3+3 design) evaluated LY3410738 monotherapy in IDH1\/2m R\/R AML (NCT04603001). Key objectives included determining the RP2D, safety, PK, PD (inhibition of plasma D-2-HG), and preliminary antitumor activity.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>As of 28 July 2022, 114 pts including 108 R\/R AML pts received LY3410738 dosed at 5-600 mg QD or 40-300 mg BID. Pts were median 73 years of age (range, 22-92) with a median of 2 prior therapies (range, 1-10); 29% received a prior IDH inhibitor and 58% a prior BCL2 inhibitor. Median time on treatment was 2.3 months (range, 0.1-15). No DLTs or treatment related deaths were observed. Treatment emergent adverse events &#8805;20% were diarrhea (22%), fatigue (21%), and anemia (20%). Differentiation syndrome was reported in 11 pts (10%); 4 grade 1\/2 (4%), 7 grade 3 (6%). LY3410738 exposure was dose proportional. In pts with IDH1m cancers, LY3410738 achieved sustained D-2-HG inhibition at all dose levels including in pts who received prior IDH1 inhibitor. In pts with IDH2m cancers, a higher dose (&#8805;150 mg daily dose) was required for D-2-HG inhibition. Responses were observed in both IDH1m and IDH2m AML (Table). Higher doses were required for IDH2m AML, especially IDH2 R140m pts. Efficacy appears higher in venetoclax na&#239;ve pts and limited in IDH inhibitor pre-treated pts.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> LY3410738 demonstrated a favorable safety profile with potent and sustained D-2-HG inhibition in pts with IDH1m R132, IDH2m R172, and IDH2m R140 mutations. Preliminary efficacy was also seen in all genotypes, in a dose dependent manner. RP2D evaluation is ongoing.<br \/><b>Table: Response <\/b><b>in<\/b><b> R\/R AML <\/b><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\"
