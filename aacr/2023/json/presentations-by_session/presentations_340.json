[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction: <\/b>Multiple myeloma (MM), a clonal disorder of terminally differentiated plasma cells, is the second most common hematologic malignancy with ~57.9% 5-year survival rate. Current MM therapies are not curative and in most patients MM relapse. Aiming to restore antitumor immunity and counteract MM evolution, we have developed a personalized dendritic(DC)\/MM cell fusion vaccine, whereby several tumor antigens are presented in the context of DC mediated co-stimulation. BMT CTN 1401 is a multicenter randomized phase II clinical trial (NCT02728102) evaluating the efficacy of the DC\/MM vaccine combined with lenalidomide maintenance (Len) after autoHCT. 203 patients were enrolled from 18 centers. <b>Aim:<\/b> To evaluate the impact of the DC\/MM vaccine on the establishment of anti-MM immune response we profiled the peripheral blood (PB) immune landscape at the single-cell level, with particular focus on the T cell compartment.<br \/><b>Method:<\/b> We performed single-cell immunoprofiling (gene expression + V(D)J sequencing) on 40 patients (3xDC\/MM vaccine\/Len\/GM-CSF: N=20; Len\/GM-CSF: N=10; Len: N=10). 160 PB mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples were collected at enrollment, prior to Len, after 1 and 3 vaccines and were processed using the 10x Genomics single cell 5' assay. Here we present the analysis relative to 52 PBMC samples from 13 vaccinated patients included in the initial study cohort. The remaining 108 PBMC samples have already been subjected to single-cell immunoprofiling and the analysis is ongoing.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>309,423 cells passed quality-check identifying 47 cell populations, corresponding to 20 major compartments. The T cell compartment (146,373 cells) was divided into 14 different cell populations including activated CD8, CD4, and NKT cells that exhibited a gradual increase during the course of the study. Relatively, TCR sequencing demonstrated a recovery of T cell clonal diversity and a progressive rise in the frequency of expanded clonotypes within the activated CD4 and cytotoxic T cell populations after vaccination. Consistently, we observed a progressively raised number of shared TCR clonotypes within the activated CD8 and CD4 T cell subsets. The identification of common epitope\/paratope hotspots among the expanded clonotypes and the different patients revealed a higher proportion of shared TCR clonotype groups across patients after vaccination compared to the early post-transplant period, predominantly after 3 vaccinations.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Assessment of PBMC samples from 13 vaccinated patients provided a detailed picture of the PBMC landscape. The constant T cell expansion in patients following vaccination coupled with the shared paratope\/epitope hotspots and TCR signatures among patients indicated the TCR cross-reactivity and suggested for the establishment of an anti-MM immune response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Vaccines,Multiple myeloma,T lymphocytes,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Giulia Cheloni<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Dimitra Karagkouni<sup>2<\/sup>, Daniela Torres<sup>1<\/sup>, David  J.

NT-I7 (efineptakin alfa; NeoImmuneTech, Inc, Rockville, MD), is a long acting IL-7 composed of recombinant human IL-7 (rhIL-7) fused to a hybrid Fc antibody platform that has significantly improved <i>in vivo<\/i> stability and half-life compared to rhIL-7. DNA cancer neoantigen vaccines are a promising personalized cancer immunotherapy capable of generating strong anti-tumor immunity, but limited by a short-lived neoantigen-specific T cell response. We hypothesize NT-I7 as an adjuvant to a DNA neoantigen vaccine will enhance the magnitude and duration of neoantigen-specific anti-tumor immunity.<br \/>Methods: C57BL\/6 mice were vaccinated with DNA vaccine encoding neoantigens present in E0771 murine breast cancer model on days 0, 3, and 6. NT-I7 (5 mg\/kg) was administered intravenously on day 4 or 13 during T cell expansion or contraction phase respectively. Primary T cell responses to neoantigens were assessed by IFN-&#947; ELISPOT. Tumor protection was evaluated by inoculating mice with 5&#215;10<sup>5<\/sup> E0771 cells subcutaneously after receiving DNA vaccine with or without NT-I7. Duration of neoantigen-specific CD8 T cell immunity was determined by <i>in vivo<\/i> CFSE killing assay.<br \/>Results: NT-I7 administered during the T cell contraction phase following the DNA vaccine increases the magnitude of neoantigen-specific T cell responses on day 20 compared to DNA vaccine alone. DNA vaccination and NT-I7 alone prior to tumor inoculation confers partial protection against tumor growth compared to control while DNA + NT-I7 during contraction phase rejects 100% of tumors. Compared to DNA vaccine alone, DNA vaccine + NT-I7 during contraction phase induces greater neoantigen-specific killing on day 41 (34.6% vs. 11.97%, p=0.03).<br \/>Conclusion: NT-I7 as an adjuvant to a DNA neoantigen vaccine increases the magnitude and duration of neoantigen-specific anti-tumor immunity in a murine model. Clinical application of NT-I7 may help overcome immunologic shortcomings of current neoantigen vaccines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,Vaccines,Immuno-oncology,Adjuvant,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Michael  Y.

Lung cancer is mostly unlikely to respond to conventional anticancer drug, therefore, oncolytic virotherapy can be the best option. Herein, we evaluated the anti-cancer activity of the previously developed three oncolytic vaccinia viruses encoding TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), angiopoietin 1 (Ang1) and both genes, especially on killing lung cancer (LC). In this study, we confirmed that our engineered vaccinia viruses showed overall higher anti-cancer activity on lung cancer cells, compared to WT. Vaccinia virus engineered with both Ang1 and TRAIL (vTRAN) showed the highest oncolytic activity and selectivity in vitro (WT &#60; vTRAIL &#60; vAng1 &#60; vTRAN). However, In vivo LLC1 murine lung cancer syngeneic model showed highest attenuated tumor growth when vTRAIL was treated (WT &#60; vAng1 &#60; vTRAN &#60; vTRAIL), which was in accordance with CD8 <sup>high<\/sup> PD1 <sup>low<\/sup> expression levels in the tissues.

For clinical tracking of the oncolytic virus (OV), human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) transgene was inserted into the virus. hNIS gene expression allows cells to take up iodine and be visible by non-invasive imaging techniques. Animal studies showed that tumor cells infected with CF33-hNIS-anti-PD-L1 express functional hNIS and are visible by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET). The current report describes imaging results from an ongoing first-in-human trial.<br \/>Methods: This is a phase I, single center, single arm clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of CF33-hNIS-anti-PD-L1 intratumoral (IT) injections in patients with metastatic TNBC. Key eligibility criteria include patients with unresectable or metastatic TNBC; progressed on at least 2 prior chemotherapies; ECOG 0-2; RECIST 1.1 measurable disease; and at least one tumor amenable to repeated IT injections. Eligible patients receive CF33-hNIS-anti-PD-L1 IT at 1 of 8 assigned dose levels (from 1 &#215; 10<sup>5<\/sup> PFU to 3 x 10<sup>8<\/sup> PFU) on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle for a total of 3 cycles of treatment. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CF33-hNIS-anti-PD-L1. Secondary objectives are to determine optimal biological dose, recommended phase II dose, and response rates. Exploratory objectives include assessing feasibility of non-invasive hNIS imaging as a method of tracking viral infection and replication. SPECT whole body imaging was performed at Cycle 1 Day 8 (C1D8).<br \/>Results: From October 2021 to October 2022, 8 patients were enrolled in this ongoing study and received at least 1 dose of CF33-hNIS-anti-PD-L1 injection at one of the first 3 dose levels (1 x 10<sup>5<\/sup>, 3 x 10<sup>5<\/sup>, or 1 x 10<sup>6<\/sup> PFU). All 8 patients underwent SPECT imaging at C1D8 with 6\/8 patients (75%) having uptake at the site of injection on the SPECT imaging study. Four of 4 patients (100%) with injection sites at metastatic subcutaneous nodules, intramuscular masses, or axillary lymph nodes and 2\/4 patients (50%) with injection sites at matted dermal metastatic lesions had uptake on SPECT.<br \/>Conclusion: SPECT imaging successfully showed enhancement at the injected lesions in 75% of patients treated with CF33-hNIS-anti-PD-L1, even at current low doses, suggesting local viral replication and hNIS expression. Further analysis will evaluate the correlation of SPECT imaging results with pathologic immune cell infiltrate, viral staining, and tumor response. This is the first known report of hNIS-based imaging to track oncolytic poxvirus replication in humans and gives promise that this technology may be used for noninvasive tracking of systemically administered OV and other therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic virus,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Imaging,Gene therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jamie Green Rand<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Dave Yamauchi<sup>1<\/sup>, Shyambabu Chaurasiya<sup>1<\/sup>, Jianying Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Raju Pillai<sup>1<\/sup>, Colt Egelston<sup>1<\/sup>, Jonathan Kessler<sup>1<\/sup>, Badri Modi<sup>1<\/sup>, Leslie Chong<sup>2<\/sup>, Amanda Seiz<sup>2<\/sup>, Giovanni Selvaggi<sup>2<\/sup>, Nick Ede<sup>2<\/sup>, Mireya Murga<sup>1<\/sup>, Norma Martinez<sup>1<\/sup>, Wichanee Borisuthirattana<sup>1<\/sup>, Hans Meisen<sup>1<\/sup>, Susan Yost<sup>1<\/sup>, James Waisman<sup>1<\/sup>, Daphne Stewart<sup>1<\/sup>, Joanne Mortimer<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuman Fong<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuan Yuan<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Imugene Limited, Sydney, Australia,<sup>3<\/sup>Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a198e45d-6014-4aa4-ab4f-34962583fa5f","ControlNumber":"4074","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Immune resistance imparted by TGFB1 is mediated through its pleiotropic effects on vasculature, fibrogenesis and regulatory\/effector immune cells within the tumor microenvironment. Blockade of TGFB1 (TGFBi) will likely improve response to immunotherapy. IL-12 is a cytokine that through IFNg induction, promotes type 1 inflammatory response, M1 macrophages and effector CD8 T cell response. Combining TGFB1 blockade with IL-12 may maximize therapeutic benefits through simultaneously reducing immunosuppression and enhancing anti-tumor immune response.

Due to the low cost and ease of CMC, peptide vaccines have been suggested as effective immunotherapy for cancer. A variety of peptide vaccines have been designed and tested in clinical trials for decades. However, most clinical trials of peptide vaccines have failed for several reasons. Poor stability of peptides, use of inappropriate adjuvants, lack of co-delivery of peptides and adjuvants, and immunosuppression by the tumor microenvironment. We tried to solve the problems that lead to failure and developed effective platform technologies for them. The first problem was the choice of vaccine adjuvants. Poly IC and its derivatives are known to induce antigen-specific Th1 and CTL responses. Since Th1-type immunity is essential for the elimination of intracellular pathogens or tumors, they may be suitable as the adjuvant for peptide vaccines. Despite several limitations of poly IC and its derivatives, such as high heterogeneity, inconsistent activity, poor stability, and unpredictable in vivo kinetics, they still serve as major adjuvants in numerous clinical trials. A novel and defined TLR3 agonist called NexaVant (NVT) was developed as an alternative to them. NVT induces a stronger anti-cancer efficacy compared to the known TLR agonists through multiple advantages of homogeneity, stability, and quantitative in vivo kinetics. Second, the stability of peptides was dramatically improved by a peptide\/adjuvant complex formation. When a cationic peptide domain is introduced into the epitope together with an epitope processing domain, the peptide and adjuvant can form a nanocomplex by a simple charge interaction. And this complex improves the stability of the peptide which leads to improvement of the T cell immunity. Third, suppression of T cell immunity in cancer was mitigated by Treg modulation in the presence of a known chemotherapeutic drug. When this combination therapy of the vaccine and chemical was applied to various animal models, a strong anticancer effect was obtained by increasing T cell immunity and suppressing Treg. The same therapeutic effect was shown in several terminal stage tumor models with strong T cell memory regardless of whether the epitope was self or foreign originated.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Vaccines,T cell,Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Dongho Kim<sup><\/sup>, <b>SeungHwan Lee<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>NA Vaccine Institute, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"fc078b59-8f06-4b82-ae9c-5cc9e0401e65","ControlNumber":"3150","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

Stimulated tumor cell (STC) vaccine (Brenus Pharma) is composed of selected tumor cell lines, stimulated to overexpress tumor-associated or tumor-specific antigens and neoantigens including resistance factors. Haptenization of these proteins forms an immunogenic complex which stimulate the immune system to recognize and target the patient&#8217;s tumor cells expressing same resistance factors.

While VV induces potent tumor oncolysis and immunomodulation, clinical experience has shown that OV therapy alone leads to limited benefit. Moreover, OVs and checkpoint inhibitor combinations, do not significantly improve clinical responses, underscoring the need to identify new tumor microenvironment targets to overcome OV resistance in vivo. The adenosine pathway is a biologically and clinically relevant target in RCC and is associated with adaptive resistance to immunotherapy. The objectives of this study are to characterize the role of the adenosine axis in tumor escape mechanisms to vaccinia virus in RCC, and to determine the efficacy of novel OV-immunotherapy combinations targeting adenosine.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The in vitro oncolytic effects of JX-594 and mJX-594 (oncolytic VVs expressing human or murine GMCSF, respectively) in human (786-0, ACHN, CAKi-1, UOK262) and murine (RENCA) renal cancer cell lines were assessed. Proteomic analysis of 786-0 lysates treated with JX-594 was performed for mechanistic studies. The effects of JX-594 and mJX 594 on CD73 and CD39 expression were determined in human and murine RCC.

Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are novel cancer biotherapies, and the oncolytic measles virus (MV) has demonstrated safety and antitumor activity in early clinical studies. Triptolide (TRP), a diterpenoid epoxide extracted from the thunder god vine, and Minnelide (MN), its water-soluble compound, are novel agents associated with potent antitumor, anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, antiangiogenic, and ER stress inducing effects. The objectives of this study are to characterize the in vitro and in vivo effects and molecular mechanisms of measles virotherapy in combination with TRP and MN in CRC.<br \/><b><u>Methods<\/u><\/b>: The in vitro effects of TRP, MV-GFP (Edmonston strain of Measles virus expressing eGFP), MV-CD46-muPA (dual targeted MV against the murine uPA receptor and human CD46), or virus-triptolide combinations on tumor cell cytotoxicity were assessed on HT-29, HCT116 and SW620 CRC cells. Molecular and mechanistic characterization of TRP&#8217;s effects alone and combination with MV in HT29 cells was analyzed by the Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) and validated by western blot analysis. In vivo effects (tumor progression and survival) of MN alone and in combination with MV vectors using different treatment schemes were assessed in HT-29 tumor bearing NSG mice, and tumor correlative studies were performed.<br \/><b><u>Results<\/u><\/b>: MV and TRP had single agent antitumor activity against human CRC cell lines. MV-TRP combinations were associated with increased in vitro cytotoxicity compared to single agent treatments. Functional proteomics analysis showed that TRP-MV combinations were associated with inhibition of survival and proliferation pathways, such as AKT, ERK, inhibition of HSP70 as well as induction of autophagy, at a higher level than each agent alone. In vivo, both a 7-days MN treatment and a 21-days MN treatment significantly improved long term tumor control and significantly improved survival, compared to each agent alone.

SETD2 is frequently inactivated in kidney cancer. We hypothesized that SETD2 deficiency would cause aberrant translation of retained introns (ATaRI) that could serve as potential immunotherapeutic targets in <i>SETD2<\/i>-mutant states.<br \/>Methods and Results: We detected increased presence of retained introns in <i>SETD2<\/i>-mutant vs WT tumors in two publicly available renal cell carcinoma RNA-seq data sets. We hypothesized that if intronic sequences translated into proteins, accumulation of misfolded proteins would activate the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). The UPR pathway was strongly transcriptionally enriched as measured by GSEA, as were several immunotherapy-relevant pathways, suggesting that tumors are inflamed, possibly related to the antigenic nature of translated introns. To investigate this further, we generated Setd2-isogenic mouse renal cancer cells using CRISPR in the RENCA cell line. RNAseq followed by GSEA confirmed upregulation of UPR pathway transcriptional signature in the Setd2-null condition, supporting our observation in human tumors. Indicators of UPR activation such as cleavage of ATF6 and increase in ATF4 and Xbp1 levels in Setd2 deficient vs. unedited RENCA cells, as well as nuclear translocation of ATF6 in <i>SETD2<\/i>-mutant human kidney cancer samples validates these findings. We then measured the presence of ATaRI-derived peptides in <i>Setd2<\/i>-mutant RENCA cells using mass spectrometry, detecting 47 such peptides. Using publicly available proteomics data from one human data set, we preliminarily identified peptides translated from 151 introns that are retained in <i>SETD<\/i>2-mutant cases. Applying netMHCpan to both the human and murine data, we found that detectable ATaRI peptides were predicted to generate multiple 10-amino acid-long peptides which strongly bind to the 8 murine MHC or to the 20 most common human HLA receptors. We propose that these presentable peptides might activate an immune response to SETD2-mutant renal cell carcinoma.<br \/>Conclusions: We identified intron retention which may cause activation of the UPR as a feature of <i>SETD2<\/i>-mutant kidney cancer. ATaRI peptides are detectable and should be presented to the adaptive immune system. These features may represent a new therapeutic vulnerability for exploitation as a rationale for personalized medicine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kidney cancer,Neoantigens,Splice variants,Vaccines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Marya T.

Various types of OVs in clinical development, including Vaccinia virus (VACV)-derived OVs, have shown good safety profiles, but limited therapeutic efficacy as monotherapy in some cancer models. Many different methods have been employed to improve the oncolytic potency of OVs. We used a directed evolution process, pooling multiple species of orthopoxviruses to generate chimeric poxviruses with increased oncolytic properties. Through selective pressure by successive passages on human tumor cells, a new chimeric oncolytic poxvirus, named PoxSTG, was derived. The chimeric viral genome contains, in addition to sequences from several strains of Vaccinia virus, sequences of Rabbitpox virus and Cowpox virus. Compared with its parental viruses, PoxSTG has demonstrated superior oncolytic characteristics, and was notably attenuated in normal primary cells. PoxSTG has superior secretion of extracellular-enveloped virus (EEV) compared to all parental strains inducing higher dissemination of the virus into the tumors and more resistance to neutralization. PoxSTG was saved and showed potent antitumor effects in several syngeneic and xenograft mouse models of cancers. Furthermore, PoxSTG exerted low-dose antitumor effects in virus-injected and non-virus-injected distant tumors in a CRC xenograft model, demonstrating strong virus spread to distant tumors. All these data demonstrate the potential of PoxSTG as a novel therapeutic agent for cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic virus,Vaccinia virus,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Philippe Erbs<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Annie Findeli<sup><\/sup>, Johann Foloppe<sup><\/sup>, Juliette Kempf<sup><\/sup>, Isabelle Farine<sup><\/sup>, Baptiste Moreau<sup><\/sup>, Julie Hortelano<sup><\/sup>, Christelle Pichon<sup><\/sup>, Jules Deforges<sup><\/sup>, Eric Quemeneur<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Transgene S.A., Illkirch Graffenstaden, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"31932fca-ba79-4425-87a2-b57ce455b673","ControlNumber":"3645","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;P.

Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are needed. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) represent a new strategy to augment the spectrum of cancer therapeutics. Several studies reported that, in MM, the OVs act through tumor-specific oncolysis and generation of an antitumor immune response. The main viruses that have been tested for MM setting are human viruses, this approach is highly restricted by pre-existing anti-virus humoral immunity that neutralize the anti-tumor effect of OVs. Recently, our group have demonstrated for the first time the role of a bovine virus, non-pathogen for the human, Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) in direct MM cell killing suggesting its possible use as alternative strategy in MM oncolytic virotherapy. The aim of this study was to increase the bovine oncolytic viruses&#8217;s spectrum for anti-MM treatment investigating the role of another bovine virus, Bovine Herpes Virus type 1 (BoHV-1), in the direct effect on MM cells. Firstly, after virus preparation, we treated human MM cell lines (HMCLs) for 24, 48 and 72 hours with BoHV-1 at 1 and 2 multiplicity of infection (MOI). We showed a significant increase of cell mortality, checked by flow cytometry analysis, already after 48 hours of infection in JJN3 (BoHV-1 1 MOI <i>vs <\/i>untreated <i>p&#60;<\/i> 0.001; BoHV-1 2 MOI <i>vs <\/i>untreated <i>p&#60;<\/i> 0.001) and in MM1.S (BoHV-1 1 MOI <i>vs <\/i>untreated <i>p<\/i>= 0.025; BoHV-1 2 MOI <i>vs <\/i>untreated <i>p<\/i>= 0.002). Interestingly, the cytotoxic effect of BoHV-1 treatment in HMCLs was associated by a significant increased expression of apoptotic markers as Apo2.7, evaluated by flow cytometry (JJN3 at 48 hours: BoHV-1 1 MOI <i>vs <\/i>untreated <i>p<\/i>= 0.007; BoHV-1 2 MOI <i>vs <\/i>untreated <i>p<\/i>= 0.001. MM1.S at 48 hours: BoHV-1 1 MOI <i>vs <\/i>untreated <i>p&#60;<\/i> 0.001; BoHV-1 2 MOI <i>vs <\/i>untreated <i>p&#60;<\/i> 0.001). Subsequently, we infected bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) obtained from MM patients with BohV-1 for 48 and 72 hours. Already after 48 hours of infection, we found that MM cells had significantly increased cell mortality in BoHV-1-treated BMMNCs compared with untreated conditions. Overall, our data indicate that BoHV-1, as BVDV, was able to exert a direct anti-tumor effect on both HMCLs and primary cells from MM patients. In addition, data from ongoing studies will characterize the role of immune microenvironment in bovine oncolytic virotherapy. Focusing on monocytes, NK cells and CD8+ T cells we will explore a possible bovine virus-induced immune response to enhance anti-MM virotherapy. This study will highlight the possible use of non-human OVs as new anti-MM strategy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic virus,Multiple myeloma,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Valentina Marchica<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Rosanna Vescovini<sup>1<\/sup>, Valentina Franceschi<sup>2<\/sup>, Paola Storti<sup>1<\/sup>, Nicolas Thomas Iannozzi<sup>1<\/sup>, Vincenzo Raimondi<sup>1<\/sup>, Oxana Longu<sup>1<\/sup>, Jessica Burroughs Garcia<sup>3<\/sup>, Denise Toscani<sup>1<\/sup>, Anna Benedetta Dalla Palma<sup>3<\/sup>, Gaetano Donofrio<sup>2<\/sup>, Nicola Giuliani<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Medical-Veterinary Science, University of Parma, Parma, Italy,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Parma, Parma, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4dcd3d93-0c11-4282-ac05-b5f6f89eab7d","ControlNumber":"3563","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>V.

Unfortunately, its response rate in clinical trials was not promising. On the vaccine part, sufficient stimulation of strong and long-lasting local and systemic immunity and efficient promotion of intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes are among the critical issues determining the therapeutic efficacy of cancer vaccines in addition to the innate features of tumor. Our project aims to develop a porous silicon particle based particulate vaccine against cancer, and investigate the therapeutic mechanism and combinational effects with current first-line strategies.<br \/>Method: We first screened the combinations of ligands of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) expressing on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and selected the most powerful combo for immune stimulation. We then loaded the identified adjuvants in addition to antigen peptides to produce vaccine particles. Stimulation and licensing of APCs were tested in vitro, and its therapeutic efficacies were evaluated on multiple orthotopic and systemic metastasis cancer murine models of breast and colon cancers. Furthermore, we investigated the vaccine&#8217;s synergistic effects and impacts on tumor microenviroment (TME) with an immunogenic chemotherapeutic oxaliplatin on a CT26 colon cancer model.<br \/>Result: According to the adjuvant screening assays, we identified a capable combination of CpG1826 (CpG) and 2&#8217;3&#8217;-cGAMP (cGAMP), which extensively stimulated the activation, maturation and type-I interferon secretion of APCs. A &#181;GCVax formulation composed by these two adjuvants and antigen peptides was then applied on primary and metastatic HER2+ breast cancer TUBO bearing mice. &#181;GCVax potently promoted the activation and lymph node migration of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> and CD103<sup>+<\/sup> dendritic cells in vivo. Distal metastatic tumor nodules in all different tissues vanished after two vaccinations. Functional cure of cancer and extension of animal survival were achieved. Moreover, oxaliplatin treatment on colon cancer caused immunogenic cell death and generated an immune favorable TME in a subcutaneous CT26 colon cancer model. The combination of &#181;GCVax with the oxaliplatin effectively blocked the progression of large tumor mass. We finally revealed that the reprogramming of TME and the promotion of efficacy were mostly achieved from diminishing myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in tumor.<br \/>Conclusion: &#181;GCVax is an effective and board-spectrum formulation for cancer immunotherapy. It effectively induces APC activation and licensing, and stimulates the innate and adaptive immunity against multiple cancers. The combination with oxaliplatin further promotes the therapeutic efficacy of &#181;GCVax by decreasing tumor MDSCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer vaccine,Nanoparticle,Adjuvant,Oxaliplatin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Junhua Mai<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Yongbin Liu<sup><\/sup>, Dongfang Yu<sup><\/sup>, Haifa Shen<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c522fdf3-982b-4a39-8a52-dfe054e057a0","ControlNumber":"7207","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

Our group previously demonstrated that an autologous whole tumor cell vaccine (rWTC-MBTA: irradiated autologous whole tumor cells pulsed with Mannan-BAM, TLR ligands, and anti-CD40 antibody) had a potent anti-tumor immune response and prolonged survival in a mouse colon carcinoma model. To investigate whether rWTC-MBTA would work in &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor models, we evaluated the vaccine&#8217;s effect on preventing and treating tumor metastasis in 4T1 breast tumors. Our data showed that vaccinated mice could significantly prevent lung metastasis in both intravenous injection and mammary pad subcutaneous implantation animal models. Further, we used another metastasis model that more closely mimics clinical practice by resecting the primary tumor after metastasis development. The data showed that vaccinated mice could prevent tumor recurrence, increase T-cell infiltration in the metastatic tumor, and prolong the survival curve. The mechanistic investigation by immunophenotyping revealed that rWTC-MBTA vaccination induced both effector memory (CD44<sup>+<\/sup>CD62L<sup>-<\/sup>) and center memory (CD44<sup>+<\/sup>CD62L<sup>+<\/sup>) T cells as well as increased overall CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cell count while depletion experiments demonstrated that CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells were required for vaccine efficacy. Isolated splenocytes co-cultured with 4T1 cells showed rWTC-MBTA significantly increased T-cell mediated cytotoxicity through TNF-a and IFN-&#947; in CD107a<sup>+<\/sup>CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and Granzyme B and IFN-&#947; in CD107a<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. In all experiments, vaccination exerted negligible systemic toxicity. Collectively, our study demonstrates that the rWTC-MBTA vaccine is a safe and promising therapeutic option to prevent and treat tumor metastasis by triggering an antitumor immune response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-12 Vaccines (oncolytic and prophylactic),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Immunotherapy,Vaccines,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Juan Ye<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Herui Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Mitchell Sun<sup>1<\/sup>, Ondrej Uher<sup>1<\/sup>, Mark  R.
