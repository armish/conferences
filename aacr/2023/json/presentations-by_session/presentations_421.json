[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction:<\/b><br \/>Surgery is a crucial intervention to cure malignancies. However, evidence shows that the surgical insult and its accompanying immune response can enhance tumor growth and metastasis. Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) released systemically during surgical stress were previously shown to contribute to this process. In fact, to generate increased energy demands required for growth and metastasis, cancer cells in a stressful microenvironment need an adaptive mechanism where metabolic reprogramming to fatty acid (FA) oxidation has been emerging as an important process. Here, we aim to explore the direct effects of surgical NETs in regulating cancer cell metabolism leading to tumor growth and metastasis.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b><br \/>For the indolent tumor model, C57BL\/6 mice were injected with a small number of LLC-1 (Lewis Lung Cancer-1) cells subcutaneously (SQ) and a group was subjected to laparotomy for 30 mins, with or without intraperitoneal DNAse (NET inhibitor) injection perioperatively. Tumor growth was then followed for 4 weeks. For the tumor metastasis model, LLC-1 cells were injected SQ and allowed to grow for 3 weeks before resection with or without perioperative DNAse. Tumor metastasis to the lungs was assessed after 3 weeks. In vitro experiments on LLC-1 and MC-38 (murine colon adenocarcinoma) cancer cells were performed using NETs released from neutrophils freshly isolated from mice bone marrow and stimulated with Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b><br \/>For the indolent tumor model, injection of cancer cells did not lead to any significant tumor growth after 4 weeks unless mice underwent surgical stress via laparotomy. Treatment with DNAse significantly reversed their growth. For the tumor metastasis model, tumor resection alone led to significant lung metastasis, but DNAse treatment during resection or resection in PAD-4 KO mice (unable to form NETs) led to significantly less metastatic burden. Furthermore, in vitro treatment of cancer cells with NETs lead to significant cell proliferation, relatively more under hypoxic and serum conditions. This was paralleled with a significant increase in fluorescently labeled FA uptake into cancer cells as detected by flow cytometry, as well as a significant upregulation of gene expression of FA transport proteins and oxidation enzymes.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b><br \/>Surgical stress can promote tumor growth and metastasis through cancer cell metabolic reprogramming induced by systemically released NETs. We hope that elucidating the molecular mechanism behind this process can help in finding therapeutics to prevent the protumorigenic effects of surgical stress.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune response,Surgical resection,Inflammation,Fatty acids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tony Haykal<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Ruiqi Yang<sup><\/sup>, Celine Tohme<sup><\/sup>, Ronghua Wang<sup><\/sup>, David Geller<sup><\/sup>, Christof Kaltenmeier<sup><\/sup>, Hamza Yazdani<sup><\/sup>, Samer Tohme<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"36ab2700-203b-44a0-b8ab-0893a29abacb","ControlNumber":"5421","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

Although remission rates are high if detected early, survival rates drop substantially when breast cancer becomes metastatic. The most common sites of metastatic breast cancer are bone, liver and lung. Respiratory viral infections inflict illnesses on countless people. The latest pandemic caused by the respiratory virus, SARS-CoV-2, has infected more than 600 million worldwide, with documented COVID-related death upward of 1 million in the United States alone. Respiratory viral infections result in increased inflammation with immune cell influx and expansion to facilitate viral clearance. Prior studies have shown that inflammation, including through neutrophils, can contribute to dormant cancer cells reawakening and outgrowth. Moreover, inhibition of IL6 has been shown to decrease breast cancer lung metastasis in mouse models. However, how respiratory viral infections contribute to breast cancer lung metastasis remains to be unraveled. Using MMTV\/PyMT and MMTV\/NEU mouse models of breast cancer lung metastasis and influenza A virus as a model respiratory virus, we demonstrated that acute influenza infection and the accompanying inflammation and immune cell influx awakens and dramatically increased proliferation and expansion of dormant disseminated cancer cells (DCC) in the lungs. Acute influenza infection leads to immune influx and expansion, including neutrophils and macrophages, with increased proportion of MHCII<sup>+<\/sup> macrophages in early time points, and a sustained decrease in CD206<sup>+<\/sup> macrophages starting 6 days post-infection until 28 days after the initial infection. Additionally, we observed a sustained accumulation of CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells around expanding tumor cells for as long as 28 days after the infection. Notably, neutrophil depletion or IL6 knockout reversed the flu-induced dormant cell expansion in the lung. Finally, awakened DCC exhibited downregulation of vimentin immunoreactivity, suggesting a role for phenotypic plasticity in DCC outgrowth following viral infection. In conclusion, we show that respiratory viral infections awaken and increase proliferation of dormant breast cancer cells in the lung, and that depletion of neutrophils or blocking IL6 reverses influenza-induced dormant cell awakening and proliferation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Interleukin-6,Inflammation,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shi Biao Chia<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Bryan Johnson<sup>1<\/sup>, Julio  A.

Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) has a significantly poorer prognosis compared to metastasis to the other regions of the body. Immunotherapy makes use of the memory and specificity of the adaptive immune system to achieve long lasting effective anti-tumor response. Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment have been implicated in tumorigenesis by creating an anti-inflammatory environment suitable for the growth of cancer cells. Thus, our group sought to identify factors associated with immunomodulation in colorectal PC.<br \/>Methods: We interrogated publicly available colorectal cancer single cell database (n=5) to identify putative immune markers associated with macrophage activation in cancers. Validation was performed using V-set and immunoglobulin containing domain 4 (VSIG4) immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining on tumor microarrays (TMAs) of colorectal primary tumors (n=210). VSIG4 protein expression was assessed in cell-free ascites (n=39) derived from PC.<br \/>Results: Using publicly available single cell database, we shortlisted the top 100 genes from the expression data of CD136-positive TAMs cluster. Among these macrophage-associated genes, two putative markers, VSIG4 and NR1H3, were involved in the regulation of macrophage activation. NR1H3, also known as liver X receptor-alpha (LXR-&#945;), is particularly associated with cholesterol metabolism and thus was excluded from our exploration of TAMs activity. Interestingly, our target of choice, VSIG4, is a membrane protein expressed by M2 macrophages, which is associated with the activation of anti-inflammatory macrophage subtype and the downregulation of pro-inflammatory macrophages. IHC staining of CRC TMA demonstrated that low VSIG4 expression in stroma of primary CRC is associated with poor prognosis (p=0.018). Moreover, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of the ascites from colorectal PC patients showed varying amounts of VSIG4, suggesting a possible biological role of VSIG4 amongst patients with upregulated VSIG4 levels in ascites. Taken together, our studies suggest that VSIG4 plays a possible immunomodulatory role in colorectal PC and warrants further studies to assess its potential role as a therapeutic target in PC.<br \/>Conclusion: In view of its potential as a target for immunotherapy, further studies should be conducted to understand the role of VSIG4 in the progression of colorectal PC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Peritoneal metastasis,Tumor microenvironment,V-set and immunoglobulin containing domain 4 (VSIG4),Tumor associated macrophages,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yik Yan Chong<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sasinthiran Thiagarajan<sup>1<\/sup>, Qiu Xuan Tan<sup>1<\/sup>, Hui Jun Lim<sup>1<\/sup>, Joey Wee-Shan Tan<sup>1<\/sup>, Josephine Hendrikson<sup>1<\/sup>, Gillian Ng<sup>1<\/sup>, Ying Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Clara Yieh Lin Chong<sup>1<\/sup>, Chin Jin Seo<sup>2<\/sup>, Jolene Si Min Wong<sup>2<\/sup>, Claramae Shulyn Chia<sup>2<\/sup>, Nicholas Brian Shannon<sup>1<\/sup>, Chin-Ann Johnny Ong<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Laboratory of Applied Human Genetics, National Cancer Centre Singapore, Singapore, Singapore,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Sarcoma, Peritoneal and Rare Tumours (SPRinT), National Cancer Centre Singapore, Singapore, Singapore","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b57e2ae6-df98-4d4a-9fc7-3be9a0a3b682","ControlNumber":"2793","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Th2 cytokines (e.g. IL-4, IL-5, IL13) drive defined allergic reactions and various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases including atopic dermatitis (AD), asthma and rhinitis. IL-4Ra is a receptor shared by both IL-4 and IL-13, thus blocking of IL-4Ra could prevent both IL-4 or IL-13 mediated Th2 inflammatory response. Dupilumab (Dupixent) is a humanized anti-IL-4Ra monoclonal antibody which binds to human IL-4Ra and attenuates IL-4\/IL-13 mediated Th2 inflammation. It has been approved for treating moderate to severe AD and asthma. However, since Dupilumab isn&#8217;t cross-reacting to mouse IL-4Ra, there is an unmet need for a robust mouse model to evaluate Dupilumab biosimilars at preclinical stages. In this study, we described an oxazolone induced AD model in hIL-4\/hIL-4Ra double knock-in mice and its application to evaluate Dupilumab and its biosimilars.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>. The oxazolone induce AD mouse model was established in hIL-4\/hIL-4Ra double knock-in mice by repeated topical applications of Oxazolone on ears. Oxazolone-induced mice received subcutaneous injection of Dupilumab at 25 mg\/kg or 50 mg\/kg. Dermatitis activity was assessed by measuring ear thickness, ear skin erosion, redness and scaling every other day. Serum were collected at the study end and IgE levels were measured by ELISA. In addition, spleens were also collected and their weights were compared. Ear were collected at study end and proceeded with cytokine analysis and pathology evaluation.<br \/><b>Results.<\/b> Repeated topical application of oxazolone on mouse ears induced AD-like phenotypes including ear skin swelling, erythema and scaling, drastic elevation of IgE in serum, excessive production of human IL-4 cytokine as well as excessive inflammatory cell infiltration in ear skin, which suggests oxazolone is able to induce AD in this hIL-4\/hIL-4Ra double knock-in mice. Subcutaneous injection of Dupilumab at two different doses levels, 25 mg\/kg and 50 mg\/kg successfully ameliorated ear skin swelling, erythema and scaling at the study end. In addition, Dupilumab at both dose levels significantly reduced the IgE level in serum and mitigated the inflammatory cell infiltration, e.g. eosinophil infiltration, in mouse ear. Furthermore, Dupilumab treatment significantly reduced mouse IL-6 and mouse KC\/GRO levels in mouse ear. However, Dupilumab at both dose levels did not change the serum levels of human IL-4 as well as some other Th1 cytokines such as IFN-&#947;, IL-1&#946;, TNF-&#945;, etc. in mouse ear.<br \/><b>Conclusion.<\/b> In summary, repeated challenge with Oxazolone in hIL-4\/hIL-4Ra double knock-in mice resulted in the development of AD with a Th2-like hypersensitivity, mimicking the key features and pathology of the human disease, which responded to standard of care treatment Dupilumab.

Immune checkpoint molecules are essential for modulating immune responses and maintaining self-tolerance. While immune checkpoint inhibitors have improved the treatment of a broad spectrum of cancers, many of them are also believed to play a critical role in the induction of immune related adverse events (irAEs) such as autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. For example, patients receiving anti-PD-1 based therapy frequently develop colitis. In addition, dysfunctional PD-1 signalling has also been linked to increasing susceptibility to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Therefore, immune checkpoint molecule agonist which could, like their natural ligands, confer a great potential in suppressing excessively activated immune response observed in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>. In the first part, the proinflammation effects of a Pembrolizumab analogue was evaluated in a MC38-OVA colorectal tumor bearing mice treated with or without DSS. In the second part, an anti-hPD-1 agonistic antibody at 10 mg\/kg was evaluated in acute DSS IBD model.<br \/><b>Results.<\/b> In the MC38-OVA colorectal cancer model, mice treated with Pembrolizumab analogue only or Pembrolizumab analogue plus 1.5% DSS showed significant tumor growth inhibition (100% TGI and 92.01% TGI, respectively at Day 27) compared to their respective control group, which suggests this Pembrolizumab analogue induced robust anti-tumor immunity against MC38-OVA tumors. Notably, 8\/8 mice treated with Pembrolizumab analogue only showed complete tumor regression, while only 5\/8 mice treated with Pembrolizumab analogue plus DSS showed complete tumor regression. Taken together, these results suggest DSS treatment leading to a proinflammatory context could compromise anti-hPD-1 anti-tumor efficacy. Moreover, mice treated with Pembrolizumab analogue plus DSS also showed 3.59% more Body Weight Loss (BWL) in comparison to 1.5% DSS only group, suggesting that Pembrolizumab analogue could exacerbate DSS induced colitis. In the acute DSS IBD model, mice treated with an agonistic anti-hPD-1 antibody showed significantly lower disease score (DAI 5.3 vs DAI 2.4) and less BWL (BWL 13.44% vs BWL 3.31%) in comparison to isotype control group. In addition, pathology results showed that mice treated with agonistic anti-hPD-1 exhibits significantly less inflammatory cell infiltration and colonic lesions when compared to isotype control group.<br \/><b>Conclusion.<\/b> In summary, we reported in this study that blocking of PD-L1\/PD-1 signalling axis by a PD-1 antagonist activated T cell function which at the same time aggravated DSS induced colitis in mouse.

In addition, NK cells are the main performers of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), which binds to the Fc-terminus of antibodies through their surface Fc receptor CD16A, thereby killing antibody-targeted tumor cells. Enhancing the ADCC action of NK cells themselves enhances the therapeutic efficacy of monoclonal antibodies targeting tumor surface antigens and is therefore of great importance in the treatment of tumors, especially solid tumors. We screened two optimal structures among nine different Fc chimeric receptors, and NK cells overexpressing these two receptors killed K562 and Daudi six times more intensely than normal NK cells when combined with rituximab, while the killing ability was comparable to that of normal NK without rituximab, indicating that NK cells expressing chimeric Fc receptors have stronger ADCC effects. Moreover, these NK cells can kill target cells in multiple rounds. In vivo experiments in mice demonstrated that NK cells expressing chimeric Fc receptors in combination with EGFR monoclonal antibodies had a stronger inhibitory effect on tumor growth than monoclonal antibodies or NK cells alone. Here we provide a novel broad &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; NK cells that can significantly enhance the killing ability of hematological and solid tumors in combination with different monoclonal antibodies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Solid tumors,CAR NK cells,ADCC,Monoclonal antibodies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yanan Lin<sup>1<\/sup>, Shengbang Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Jie Ran<sup>1<\/sup>, Can Song<sup>1<\/sup>, Shengcang Zhu<sup>1<\/sup>, Hui Shi<sup>1<\/sup>, Ping Guo<sup>1<\/sup>, Shengjiang Tan<sup>2<\/sup>, Yuchun Gu<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Lida Wu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Allife Medical Science and Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"beab7088-8cf3-4d8f-8bb6-472a536eec15","ControlNumber":"2722","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;Y.

However, the perioperative period is characterized by an increased risk for accelerated growth of metastatic disease. Our recent work shows that the protumorigenic systemic inflammatory changes and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) persist months after surgery in both mice and humans, and parallel micrometastatic tumor growth and recurrence. Here we hypothesized that surgery may induce long-term sustained epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in bone marrow derived granulocytes-monocytes progenitor cells (GMPs) leading to functional reprogramming of mature neutrophils and persistent systemic release of these protumorigenic NET-forming neutrophils.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Eight-week-old mice were subjected to non-lethal surgical stress (laparotomy) for 30 mins. Seven days after, mice were inoculated with 1x106 MC38 (murine colorectal cancer cells) subcutaneously. For bone marrow (BM) transplant model, a group of B6 congenic (CD45.1) mice were subjected to laparotomy. BM derived cells were harvested 7 days after the procedure and orthotopically transplanted into B6 CD45.2 irradiated (1000 rads) mice. After the establishment of hematopoiesis (6 weeks), MC38 cancer cells were implanted into the recipient mice.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Mice that underwent laparotomy had significantly increased tumor volume at 3 weeks compared to control mice, that only underwent anesthesia (Laparotomy vs control **p&#60;0.01). While the intratumoral flowcytometry analysis showed no difference in the frequency of infiltrating immune cells, quantitative (q) PCR analysis revealed significant plasticity in the tumor infiltrating neutrophils (TANs) observed by an increase in the expression of genes (MCP1, Arg1) associated with pro-inflammatory (N2) type neutrophils compared to control. A persistent increased level of NETs was also observed within the tumors and circulation of mice several weeks after laparotomy. ATAC-seq and Bulk-RNA-seq analysis further revealed major epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in TANs, circulating neutrophils and GMPs. To substantiate long-lasting surgical effects, tumor burden was assessed in the BM recipient mice and showed to be significantly increased in mice that had received BM cells from laparotomy mice versus BM cells from sham group.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Surgery promotes long-term rewiring of the bone marrow derived cells resulting in increased tumor growth.

By contrast, agonist abs targeting of CD40 (anti-CD40) antibodies (abs) has clinically elicit anti-tumor immunity with limited autoimmune complications. Here, we explore the relationships between anti-PD1 or agonist CD40 responses in melanoma tumors from type 1 IFN alpha receptor (IFNAR)-sufficient and type 1 IFNAR-deficient lupus-prone mice that overexpress IFNg. To address this, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data on tumors treated with either anti-PD1 or agonist anti-CD40 was evaluated for tumor objective responses compared to untreated controls. Cellular and canonical pathway identification from RNA-seq data were interrogated from the IPA library for significantly differential expressed genes (DEG). Variance patterns of the anti-PD1 and anti-CD40 monotherapies identified known resistance and response pathways highly concordant with IFN co-expression patterns in the RNA-sequencing data, respectively. IPA biomarker analysis for uniquely regulated genes showed that anti-PD1 induced only 59 DEG; while anti-CD40 induced 494 DEG including Il-27, and PR\/SET Domain 1 (PRDM1), a transcription factor regulated by IL-27. Specifically, signatures of MDSC development (irf8, il10); and adaptive resistance (pdcd1, pdcd1lg2, and TNFRSF5\/CD40)) were negatively associated with response to anti-P1 monotherapy. By contrast, signatures of IFN activation (stat1, Ifng, and Ifngr1), chemotaxis (Cxcl10, Il12b and Il-27), attractants (Sema3g and Sema4a), and antigen presentation MHC II (h2-Aa, h2-Ab1, and ciita) were associated positively with response to agonist anti-CD40 monotherapy. Importantly, anti-CD40 alone delivered anti-tumor immune responses in type 1 IFN receptor-deficient lupus-prone mice that overexpress IFNg (Ifnar-\/-ARE-\/-) mice suggesting synergy with therapies blocking type 1 IFN signaling. Thus, these findings indicate that the rational use of CD40 agonists abs provide a better therapeutic platform to deliver precise anti-melanoma responses in complex autoimmune landscapes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune response,Anti-PD-1,Inflammation,CD40,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Julio  C.

While immune checkpoint inhibitors and agonism of costimulatory molecules can act to stimulate leukocytes, the lack of adequate recruitment of effector cells into TME often results in suboptimal immune responses. Chemerin (retinoic acid receptor responder 2, RARRES2) is an endogenous chemoattractant that is widely expressed by many tissues and recruits innate leukocytes through its receptor, CMKLR1 which is expressed on NK cells, some dendritic cells, and macrophages. Previous studies show that RARRES2 is downregulated across multiple tumor types including prostate cancer. Here, using a syngeneic transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate (TRAMP-C1) model, we show that forced overexpression of RARRES2 by tumor cells results in significant tumor suppression and recruitment of NK and CD8+ T-cells within the TME. Male C57\/BL\/6 mice were inoculated with either RARRES2-overexpressing, vector control (VC) or mixed (50:50; VC: RARRES2) TRAMP-C1 cells. Chemerin overexpression in TRAMP-C1 cells did not alter their phenotypic behavior <i>in vitro<\/i>, but significantly suppressed tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i> in mice. Furthermore, we observed a significantly higher influx of NK (CD3-CD19-NK1.1+) and CD8+ T-cells (CD3+CD8+) in tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) from mice with mixed tumors compared with VC tumors. Depletion of NK cells, CD4+, or CD8+ T cells showed that NK cells and CD8+ T-cells, but not CD4+ T-cells, were required for chemerin-dependent suppression of TRAMP-C1 tumor growth. We found significant increases in splenic NK and CD8 T cells, and a concomitant significant decrease in splenic G-MDSC in mice with chemerin-expressing tumors compared to controls, suggesting chemerin expression within the TME has an effect on systemic immune responses. Treatment of control tumors with anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibition did not result in significant tumor suppression, while anti-PD1 treatment of chemerin-expressing tumors significantly reduced tumor growth, doubling the complete response rate in these unresponsive tumors. Thus, for the first time we have demonstrated that increasing chemerin expression within the prostate TME can suppress growth by augmenting recruitment of NK and CD8+ T-cells and has the potential to be combined with checkpoint inhibitors in order to improve response rates in non-responsive tumors. Overall, these data suggest that a tumor-targeted chemerin therapeutic may have potential to treat human prostate cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Tumor suppressor,Chemokines,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Muhammad  A.

The lack of clinical symptoms in the early stages of the disease and the poor immunogenicity of PDAC are two major causes of late diagnosis and inefficient therapies.<b> <\/b>The tumor microenvironment of PDAC is rich in stromal cells inducing desmoplasia, complicating the arrival of medical compounds, as well as in immune cells, that are suppressed by several mediators produced by cancer cells. In this setting, it has been shown that some medications can restore the antitumoral activity of innate immune cells that, in turn, re-activate also adaptive immune cells. <b><\/b>In this study, we present the combination of the TLR agonists poly(I:C) (pIC - TLR3) and resiquimod (R848 - TLR7\/8) as an immunotherapeutic tool in PDAC. <b><\/b>In a subcutaneous model of PDAC (K8484 cells, isolated from KPC mice that spontaneously develop PDAC and recapitulate the features of human pancreatic cancer), the intratumoral administration of pIC+R848 for 5 times every 2-3 days led to the complete regression of the tumor in 100% of the treated mice.<b> <\/b>Moreover, all mice were protected from a second and a third rechallenge with the same cell line, performed months after the first treatments.<b> <\/b>Mechanistic studies performed on the tumors with flow cytometry demonstrated an increase of MHC-II positive cells in the monocytic (Ly6C+) compartment, as well as an increase in the number of mature CD8+ T cells and NK cells. Similar findings were demonstrated also in another heterotopic model obtained injecting Panc02 cells, another cell line with a sarcomatous phenotype. <b><\/b>Consistently with the flow cytometry data, the depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells abolished the antitumoral efficacy of pIC+R848, while the depletion of NK cells and CSF-1R+ cells was not sufficient to abolish the antitumoral response, suggesting a strong involvement of the adaptive immunity. In line with these findings, the intratumoral administration of pIC+R848 in mice unable to produce IFN-&#947; failed to reduce the tumor growth. In conclusion, our work clearly demonstrates that pIC+R848 are an effective treatment for PDAC when injected intratumorally and that this activity strongly relies on IFN-&#947; and adaptive immunity. Further investigations are ongoing to assess their potential in orthotopic models using different routes of administration, in a setting closer to the real clinical situation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Interferons,Innate immunity,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Aldo Ummarino<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Clément Anfray<sup>2<\/sup>, Andrea Mariancini<sup>1<\/sup>, Domenico Supino<sup>2<\/sup>, Elena Magrini<sup>2<\/sup>, Cecilia Garlanda<sup>2<\/sup>, Fernando Torres Andòn<sup>3<\/sup>, Paola Allavena<sup>2<\/sup>, Alberto Mantovani<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Humanitas University, Milan, Italy,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Inflammation and Immunology, IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital, Milan, Italy,<sup>3<\/sup>Center for Research in Molecular Medicine and Chronic Diseases, Santiago de Compostela, Spain","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"09572398-6099-4357-b76c-af83ef3e6c05","ControlNumber":"3541","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

It plays an increasingly important role in cancer research to ensure clinical therapeutic success but is limited by the large amount of cell samples needed for staining controls. CyTOF&#174; technology has transformed flow cytometry by enabling 50-plus-marker analysis per tube of sample, with easy panel design and no need for single-stained or autofluorescence controls. Flow cytometry by CyTOF provides an efficient and unbiased approach to discovering novel subsets and unique functional states of immune cells, maximizing insights from precious samples.<br \/>Immunosenescence perturbs lung cancer onset and development, yet the mechanisms remain largely unknown. To study the pulmonary immune populations in aged (75 weeks old) and young adult (6-8 weeks old) mice, we built a 50-parameter panel (2 for single live-cell identification, 6 for live-cell sample barcoding, and 42 for immune profiling). A core panel of 32 antibodies was selected from Standard BioTools&#8482; catalogs to detect key cell lineage and functional surface markers. A complementary panel with 10 Maxpar&#174; antibodies was added to further study functional cell states. Maxpar Pathsetter&#8482; software was used to create an automated analytical model for high-dimensional analysis.<br \/>The 50-parameter panel successfully identified over 30 lymphoid and myeloid cell subsets including but not limited to T cells, B cells, NK cells, alveolar macrophages (AMs), dendritic cells, and neutrophils. The panel enabled high-fidelity detection of over 15 functional markers mediating proliferation, activation, inhibition, migration, tissue residence, and cellular metabolism. Automated in-depth analysis by Maxpar Pathsetter efficiently identified many aging-associated alterations in cell frequencies and functional states such as the enrichment of PD-1+ T cells and CD27- &#947;&#948; T cells that could potentially perturb anti-tumor immunity. Moreover, CyTOF technology is uniquely advanced in characterizing autofluorescent cells such as AMs. A pro-inflammatory state (higher expression of MHC-II, CD80, and PD-L1) was specifically defined for AMs in aged lungs.<br \/>This study demonstrates comprehensive single-cell immune profiling of mouse tissues with the products and solutions provided by Standard BioTools. Both the 50-parameter panel and Maxpar Pathsetter analytical model can be customized for deep characterization of specific immune populations according to the requirements of various cancer studies in mice. By utilizing end-to-end solutions offered by Standard BioTools, flow cytometry by CyTOF can significantly facilitate the mechanistic studies of mouse models to expand the understanding of human cancers and accelerate therapeutic development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aging,Pulmonary immunity,Flow cytometry by CyTOF,Automated high-dimensional analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Wenxi Xu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Stephen Li<sup><\/sup>, Alexandre Bouzekri<sup><\/sup>, Lauren Tracey<sup><\/sup>, Christina Loh<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Standard BioTools, Markham, ON, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cdfeeede-7aaa-4fd8-91c2-b7408bfe8dfc","ControlNumber":"3534","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;W.

Within these subpopulations, the well-characterized expression profiles were visually matched with single T-cell expression profiles and documented as digital images. This process resulted in 12 main T-cell subsets that were further subclassified according to their functional state (proliferation, immune checkpoint expression) and studied according to their spatial orchestration. Interestingly, the vast majority of T-cell subsets were found in all analyzed tumor entities. However, their spatial orchestration, immune checkpoint expression profile was highly variable between different tumor entities.<br \/>Conclusion: This study provides a comprehensive overview of rare T-cells subpopulations and its spatial orchestration in more than 100 different tumor entities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Tumor microenvironment,Immunohistochemistry,Deep learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Zhihao Huang<sup><\/sup>, Elena Bady<sup><\/sup>, Jan H.

The uniqueness of this tumor consists of an initial exquisite response to chemotherapy. However, at relapse, which occurs nearly in all patients, the tumor is resistant to all available therapies, causing a premature death of the patient. Despite the addition of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy to standard chemotherapy, response rates are modest and only a very small fraction of SCLC patients responds to these therapies. The mechanistic basis for acquired chemoresistance and impaired immunogenicity in SCLC remains to be elucidated. Here, we report that the expression of three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) is strongly induced in chemoresistant SCLCs. ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq analyses revealed a significant increase in chromatin accessibility of TREX1 gene locus in drug resistant SCLC cells. Depletion of TREX1 in SCLC cells caused the activation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway due to the cytoplasmic accumulation of DNA damage-associated double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and micronuclei. Furthermore, targeting TREX1 induced an innate immune response and re-sensitized chemoresistant SCLC cells to chemotherapy. These findings suggest that TREX1 upregulation may be an important mediator of cGAS\/STING pathway inactivation in cancer, contributing to the survival of resistant cells, and its inhibition may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to potentiate the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in chemoresistant and immunologically &#8216;cold&#8217; tumors, such as SCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune response,Lung cancer: small cell,Resistance,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Takahiko Murayama<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Navin R.

The efficacy of such a response depends on the immunogenicity of the tumor, which varies greatly between different cancers or the same cancer in different individuals. While most lymphomas are immunogenic, non-malignant T cells that infiltrate the lymphoma microenvironment are subjected to immunosuppressive signals and areas of nutrient depletion, which leads to T cell exhaustion and inhibition of T cell function. Metabolic enzymes, such as the cytosolic branched chain aminotransferase, BCATc, exert immunosuppressive effects limiting T cells ability to function. Previous research described BCATc as a negative regulator of T cell activation, thus identifying BCATc as a potential target for immunotherapeutic modulation in the tumor microenvironment (TME).<br \/>In the current study we exploit a low (EL4) and high (EL4-OVA) immunogenic murine lymphoma strains to explore how a loss of BCATc in T cells impacts their ability to produce anti-lymphoma immunity in mice. We used 12 week old male mice with BCATc deleted from T cells (T-BCATc<sup>KO<\/sup>) and control T-BCATc<sup>fl\/fl <\/sup>mice that express the transgenic floxed version of BCATc. Mice were injected with 2.5x10<sup>5<\/sup> cells belonging to the low (EL4) or high (EL4-OVA) immunogenic strains and tumor growth, body weight, and food intake were monitored for up to 15 days followed by collection of tumor tissues and organs. Tumors were then lysed, and the protein profile of each tumor was determined by monitoring changes in expression of protein markers of T cell exhaustion (TOX, CD39), apoptosis (BAX, PUMA), or signaling proteins, such as the ribosomal S6 protein, the protein kinase B (AKT), and the energy sensor the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).<br \/>T-BCATc<sup>KO<\/sup> mice showed significant reduction in tumor growth compared to control mice regardless of the lymphoma strain being tested. The mouse cohort with the biggest number of tumor free mice was the T-BCATc<sup>KO<\/sup> cohort injected with EL4 cells (13% of the mice were tumor free on day 9). However, EL4-OVA cells grew into smaller tumors across all cohorts. Mice had comparable food intake but T-BCATc<sup>KO<\/sup> mice, injected with EL4 cells, had a significantly lower body weight. In T-BCATc<sup>KO<\/sup> mice, the reduced EL4 tumor mass correlated with upregulated AMPK and AKT along with higher expression of PUMA. The reduced EL4-OVA tumor masses correlated with downregulated S6 and decreased TOX expression, but high expression of BAX compared to the corresponding tumors isolated from T-BCATc<sup>fl\/fl <\/sup>mice. These findings suggest that T cells deficient in BCATc can reduce lymphoma growth regardless of the immunogenicity of the lymphoma stain likely by establishing catabolic state and inducing apoptosis. Thus, BCATc may play an immunosuppressive role in the lymphoma TME and the absence of BCATc from T cells may help T cells combat lymphoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,T cell,Lymphoma,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lucas  D.

Specifically, using a 500-gene panel to assess the canonical signaling pathways of cancer, cancer type-specific genes, select immune genes, proto-oncogenes, and tumor-suppressor genes, we show that the MERSCOPE was able to spatially profile gene expression across multiple tumor types. We utilized the Vizgen Cell Boundary Stain kit to generate a molecular and cellular atlas of individual patient tumors by clustering cells based on gene expression and mapping their spatial organization. To gather insight into immuno-oncological interactions and their effect on gene expression across these tumor types, we performed a neighborhood analysis to determine how proximity to immune cells altered gene expression in tumor cells, and vice versa. We found significant gene expression changes in MHC activation and downstream pathways in immune cells located nearest to tumor cells; in tumor cells nearest to immune cells, we identified increased expression of genes related to immune response mediation and inflammation. Furthermore, we compared the annotated immune cell populations across the various cancer types to observe differences in gene expression. Here, we used publicly available single-cell RNA-sequencing data to impute gene expression for these immune cell populations. This analysis demonstrated the transcriptional variation possible in identical immune cell types that are acting in different tissue contexts. Notably, we were able to map and catalogue different patterns of gene expression relating to inflammation, immune signaling, and immune cell exhaustion. These findings demonstrate how the MERSCOPE platform can provide deep insights into the complex heterogeneity observed between different tumor types and tissues.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Tumor microenvironment,Single cell,Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ben Patterson<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Cheng-Yi Chen<sup><\/sup>, Nicolas Fernandez<sup><\/sup>, Leiam Colbert<sup><\/sup>, Jiang He<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Vizgen, Cambridge, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"adde823d-77a1-40f7-94bc-174df5cf1e7f","ControlNumber":"7535","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>B.

Amongst the hallmarks of aging, changes in host and cellular metabolism are critically involved in the development, maintenance, and functional responses of T cells. Although metabolic perturbations impact anti-tumor T cell responses, the link between age-associated metabolic dysfunction and anti-tumor immunity remains unclear. First, we utilized B16, MC38 and E0771 tumor-bearing young (2-4 months) and aged (18-24 months) C57BL\/6 mice to examine the effects of aging on tumor growth. Aged mice exhibited accelerated tumor growth in B16, MC38 and E0771 tumor models. Flow cytometric analyses of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) revealed distinct changes in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell population, decreased activation status and tumor-specificity in aged mice. Consistent with these findings, CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells functionally played a limited role in controlling tumor growth in aged mice. Here, we will explore the mechanisms of age-associated metabolic dysfunction in T cells and its implications in anti-tumor immunity. As the average life expectancy continues to increase, understanding the interplay between age-related metabolic reprogramming and maladaptive T cell immunity will be instrumental in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for older patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aging,Cancer immunotherapy,Immunotherapy,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>SeongJun Han<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Peter Georgiev<sup>1<\/sup>, Alison Ringel<sup>2<\/sup>, Arlene Sharpe<sup>1<\/sup>, Marcia Haigis<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Harvard University, Boston, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>MIT, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5871a092-6137-4cd7-8d2b-4ccdc6ea7190","ControlNumber":"2541","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Specifically, S100A9&#8217;s feedforward activation in the bone marrow (BM) induces pyroptotic cell death of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) and the activation and accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). This process creates a suppressive microenvironment including the secretion of transforming growth factor &#946; (TGF&#946;) that signals through the TGF&#946; receptor 1 (TGFBR1) to induce inhibitory processes that contribute to this phenotype. We hypothesize that targeting with an investigational TGFBR1 inhibitor, TP-6379, reduces immune suppression and restores hematopoiesis in MDS.<br \/>Methods: Primary low risk MDS BM mononuclear cells (BMMNC) were obtained from the Moffitt Total Cancer Care Protocol and cultured in vitro with TP-6379. Healthy BMMNC were purchased, treated with or without recombinant S100A9 and TP-6379.<br \/>Results: Treatment of primary MDS BMMNC (n=15) and S100A9-treated healthy BMMNC (n=5) with TP-6379 for 48 hours was observed to significantly improve proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells as measured by colony forming capacity. Total colonies, and BFU-E specific colonies, showed significant increase. This expansion of progenitors with treatment was validated by flow cytometric analysis of Lineage<sup>-<\/sup>HLA-DR<sup>-<\/sup>CD34<sup>+<\/sup> HSPC and showed a reduction in genomic instability, measured by &#947;H2AX. In addition, TP-6379 was observed to reduce the numbers of suppressive mediators; MDSC, T regs and senescent lymphocytes and increase the number of cytotoxic cells, including NK cells. Our analysis revealed that BMMNC with spliceosomal mutations, including SF3B1, have elevated sensitivity to TP-6379 treatment. Therefore, we tested wild type and SF3B1 K700E CRISPR knock-in K562 cells in the presence of TP-6379 for 48 hours. K562 is a well-established cell line model for study of MDS. The SF3B1 mutant expressing cells have significantly reduced BFU-E colony forming capacity, compared to wild type cells, concordant with higher pyroptosis activation and consistent with the BMMNC results. Hence, we measured phospho-SMAD activity, as a direct measure of TGFBR1 inhibition. SF3B1 mutant expressing cells were shown to be highly sensitive to TP-6379, with a significant loss of SMAD activation. Expression analysis of primary MDS, S100A9-treated healthy BMMNC cells and K562 SF3B1 mutant cells revealed elevated expression of SERPINE1 which was rescued by TP-6379 treatment.<br \/>Conclusions: TP-6379 restores healthy hematopoiesis in low-risk MDS, which may translate into a strong therapeutic option in a disease with few clinical options. Importantly, our work also suggests a specific role for spliceosome dysfunction in bone marrow failure and a novel role for SERPINE1 in MDS and S100A9-induced suppression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bone marrow,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,TGF-&#946;,ALK,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Erika A.

Unfortunately, the Phase III IMbassador250 trial revealed that the combination of atezolizumab (PD-L1 inhibitor) and enzalutamide failed to extend overall survival in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The mechanisms underlying treatment failure remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the regulation of immunosuppressive signaling in enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer and characterized the immune infiltrating cells in murine prostate tumors.<br \/>Methods: The expression of interferon gamma-related genes was determined using qRT-PCR and\/or western blotting. Androgen receptor (AR) and AR-V7 levels were downregulated using specific siRNA. Myc-CaP cells were chronically exposed to increasing concentrations of enzalutamide (5-50 &#956;M) for &#62;12 months, and the cells resistant to enzalutamide were referred to as Myc-CaP MDVR. The gene-regulating mechanisms in drug-resistant prostate cancer cells were determined by RNA sequencing analyses. Myc-CaP and Myc-CaP MDVR xenograft tumors were established in FVB mice, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were isolated using Ficoll. The stained immune cells were determined by flow cytometry, and the data were analyzed using Flowjo.<br \/>Results: Immune-related signaling pathways (interferon alpha\/gamma response, T cell activation, and cell chemotaxis pathways) were suppressed in C4-2B MDVR cells. However, PD-L1 expression was highly upregulated and negatively regulated by AR in C4-2B MDVR cells. Enzalutamide treatment decreased CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell but increased monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell (M-MDSC) population and PD-L1 expression in murine Myc-CaP tumors. Consistently, chemotaxis and immune response-regulating signaling pathways were suppressed, and PD-L1 expression was increased in enzalutamide-resistant Myc-CaP MDVR cells. Notably, MDSC populations were significantly increased in Myc-CaP MDVR orthotopic tumors compared with those in Myc-CaP parental tumors. Co-culturing bone marrow cells with Myc-CaP MDVR cells significantly promoted MDSC differentiation and polarized macrophages from the M1 to M2 phase.<br \/>Conclusions: Immunosuppressive signaling is activated in enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer cells.

The application of photodynamic therapy (PDT) was shown to significantly improve patient survival. Previously, we found that low dose PDT (L-PDT) enhanced the immune infiltration of MPM and increased the impact of immune checkpoint inhibitors on tumor control. However, the mechanisms behind these observations are unknown. Here, in an orthotopic murine model of MPM, we show that L-PDT upregulates tumor vascular E-Selectin expression via NF-kB. This upregulation favors enhanced leukocyte trafficking and immune mediated MPM regression.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We analyzed adhesion molecules (E-Selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1) and canonical NF-kB activation (phosphorylated I&#954;B&#945;) protein levels in endothelial (ECRF-24) cells treated by L-PDT in the presence or absence of a NEMO\/IKK&#947; siRNA in vitro. For in vivo validation, AB12-Luc MPM cells were grown in the pleural cavity of syngeneic BALB\/c mice and treated with L-PDT (verteporfin 400 &#181;g\/kg, fluence 10 J\/cm<sup>2<\/sup>, fluence rate 50 mW\/cm<sup>2<\/sup>) alone or in presence of NF-kB or E-Selectin inhibitors (NEMO Binding Domain (NBD) peptide and E-Selectin blocking antibody respectively). For each treatment group, we determined the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules (E-Selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1) and the tumor immune infiltrate by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. In parallel, the impact of L-PDT on MPM growth and mouse survival were assessed in the presence of E-Selectin inhibition.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: L-PDT increased the levels of endothelial adhesion molecules E-Selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 9 to 24 hours after L-PDT treatment in vitro. This was preceded by an increase of I&#954;B&#945; phosphorylation. In the presence of NEMO siRNAs, the expression of NEMO\/ IKK&#947; was reduced and led to E-Selectin repression. In orthotopic MPM bearing mice, the treatment of MPM by L-PDT enhanced adhesion molecules expression in tumor vasculature at 24 hours. This correlated with increased infiltration of CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>granzyme B<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells and improved tumor control and mouse survival. NF-kB inhibition impaired tumor vascular adhesion molecules upregulation and the recruitment of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in MPM. The targeted inhibition of E-Selectin abrogated the immune infiltration and tumor regression of MPM following L-PDT, which ultimately decreased animal survival in our MPM model.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Low dose PDT relieves MPM tumor vascular anergy via NF-kB mediated adhesion molecules expression.

This metabolic disadvantage leads to diminished T cell function and reduced clearance of tumor cells. The branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) are required for growth of tumor and immune cells. In the TME, BCAAs are preferentially taken up by tumor cells for protein synthesis or energy production. The first step in BCAA degradation is reversible transamination catalyzed by the cytosolic branched chain aminotransferase, BCATc. Recent investigations suggest that BCATc is immunosuppressive in the TME. We found BCATc is induced upon T cell activation, during which time, BCATc negatively regulates T cell metabolism. We hypothesized that a loss of BCATc from T cells restores effector T cell function in the TME. Tumor studies were conducted using mice with BCATc deleted from CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells (T-BCATc<sup>KO<\/sup> mice) and corresponding controls expressing the floxed transgene of BCATc in T cells (T-BCATc<sup>fl\/fl<\/sup> mice). Mice were subcutaneously injected with 2.5x10<sup>5<\/sup> murine EL-4 lymphoma cells [tumor-injected mice, n=8-9\/group] or phosphate-buffered saline [vehicle-injected mice, n=4-6\/group]. Tumor growth, body weight, and food intake were monitored for 15 days followed by collection of tumors and organs. Splenocytes were used to isolate CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells that were activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, and, after initial expansion with cytokine IL-2, reactivated to hypotolerant or fully activated CD4<sup>+<\/sup> Th1 cells, or expanded to effector CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells for 96h, in the presence or the absence of the leucine antagonist, N-acetyl-leucine amide (NALA). Supernates were tested for secretion of IFN&#947; (CD4<sup>+<\/sup>T cells) or perforin and granzyme B (CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells). T-BCATc<sup>KO<\/sup> mice demonstrated significant delay in lymphoma appearance and a 50% reduction in tumor volumes when compared to control mice. The removal of BCATc from T cells did not cause systemic overactivation of the immune system, with no changes in size or appearance of the spleen, liver, or intestines. Hypotolerant and fully activated T-BCATc<sup>KO <\/sup>CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells released significantly more IFN&#947; when compared to T-BCATc<sup>fl\/fl<\/sup> T cells. The addition of NALA reduced the IFN&#947; levels to those found in control cells. CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells from T-BCATc<sup>KO<\/sup> mice released significantly more granzyme B and perforin compared to T-BCATc<sup>fl\/fl<\/sup> T cells. These findings demonstrate that BCATc-deficient T cells provide better systemic response to lymphoma likely due to improved Th1 and effector CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell with diminished Treg function. Thus, BCATc may act as an important metabolic checkpoint of the lymphoma TME","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunosuppression,Metabolism,T cell,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tanner  J.

Myeloid cells are a key component of the TME and play key roles in initiating antitumor responses and coordinating with cells of the adaptive immune system. However, these cells are eventually hijacked by tumors and provoke local inflammation that results in chronic cancer-associated inflammation and immune escape. Extracellular adenosine (ecADO) is an immunosuppressive metabolite that is produced in tumors that binds the adenosine 2a receptor (A2aR) which is widely expressed in immune cells. Studies have shown that blocking A2aR signaling has the potential to enhance antitumor immunity by boosting T and NK cell immune responses. However, the relationship between ecADO and tumor-associated myeloid cells is less characterized. We previously reported on the antitumor activity of A2aR and CD73 blockade in preclinical models of <i>Pten<\/i>-null prostate cancer and their impact on T cell mediated responses. Here, we examine tumor-associated myeloid cell infiltration in models of castration-na&#239;ve (CNPC) and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) the impact of A2aR and CD73 blockade. Transcriptomic, flow cytometric, and immunohistochemical (IHC) profiling studies of CNPC and CRPC from conditional <i>Pten<\/i>-knockout (KO) and <i>Pten\/Trp53<\/i>-double knockout (DKO) showed that tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells constituted a significant proportion of the prostate tumor microenvironment. CD11b+\/Ly6G+ cells representing tumor associated neutrophils (TANs) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were the most abundant immune cell type comprising 14.9% and 32.1% of the total population, and 46.5% and 69.7% of infiltrating leukocytes in in CNPC and CRPC, respectively. Furthermore, CD11b+\/Ly6G+ expressed high levels of CD73. Pte-null prostate tumors were characterized with enriched adenosine signaling signatures which were greater in CRPC compared to CNPC. Treatments with the A2aR inhibitor AZD4635 alone and in combination with CD73 antibody blockade reduced adenosinergic genes as well as genes associated with TAN\/MDSC immunosuppressive functions. Additionally, tumors from treated mice exhibited improved T cell mediated cytotoxicity. Together, our findings indicate that tumor associated myeloid cells are an additional source of ecADO contributing to immune suppression which can be targeted with A2aR and CD73 inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,Adenosine,Immunomodulation,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Marco A.

The resulting C-&#62;U transition has been linked to various oncogenic mutations, most predominately in bladder cancer. While both A3A and A3B activity can account for widespread changes to the genomic landscape, prior studies have shown tumor specific effects. In hepatocellular carcinoma, A3A has been shown to be the only APOBEC3 family member capable of driving tumor formation in the presence of p53 downregulation, while studies in breast cancer have suggested A3B as a driver of tamoxifen resistance. Currently, it is unclear if both A3A and A3B drive APOBEC-induced mutagenesis in bladder cancer, or if one enzyme plays a larger mutagenic role than the other. In urothelial carcinoma, there has not been a direct comparison of A3A and A3B mutagenic activity, highlighting the need to determine the effects of each respective enzyme. To explore the effects of A3A and A3B enzymes, we accessed publicly available single cell RNA (scRNA seq) data of tumor samples from 8 bladder cancer patients. Analysis from scRNA seq data revealed an enrichment of A3A expression in both monocyte and urothelial cell populations, while A3B expression is primarily restricted to urothelial cells, suggesting a cell type specific functional difference between A3A and A3B in bladder cancer. Immunogenomic analysis of TCGA bladder cancer tumors stratified by APOBEC mutational load (High, Low, No) showed that tumors with APOBEC high mutational load had high levels of interferon gamma response, lymphocyte infiltration signature score, M1 macrophages, intratumor heterogeneity, and stromal fraction compared to tumors with low APOBEC mutational load. In addition, increases in features of genomic instability was observed in tumors with high APOBEC mutational load. Interestingly, we saw unique correlations of A3A and A3B in TCGA bladder tumors. A3A expression correlated with characteristics of an inflamed tumor microenvironment while A3B expression correlated with features of genomic instability. To elucidate the divergent effects of A3A and A3B independently, we have generated isogenic mouse bladder cancer cell lines that overexpress HA tagged A3A and A3B, to directly compare their mutagenic effects through <i>in-vitro<\/i> and <i>in-vivo <\/i>experiments. We have validated through deamination assays, the functionality of A3B in these cell lines. <i>In silico <\/i>data has shown differential roles for A3A and A3B as it relates to the tumor\/immune environment; we hypothesize that this might result in subunit specific response and resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Elucidation of the A3 specific driver of APOBEC mutagenesis in urothelial carcinoma will help identity a predictive and\/or prognostic biomarker to anti-PD-1 checkpoint immune inhibition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Mutagenesis,Immune checkpoint blockade,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Michael  S.

While treatment options have improved with the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), many patients do not respond to immunotherapy or develop resistance following initial response. A significant subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harbor somatic co-mutations in <i>Kirsten rat sarcoma virus<\/i><b> <\/b><i>(KRAS) <\/i>and<i> Liver kinase 1 [LKB1, <\/i>also known as <i>serine\/threonine kinase 11 (STK11<\/i>)] genes, whose tumors are characterized by a predominance of neutrophils and an immune suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that are resistant to ICI.

We further observed that ATRA augmented anti-PD-1 efficacy in additional murine NSCLC models with or without LKB1 loss. To understand ATRA-mediated anti-tumor effects, we performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of KPL murine tumors with or without 6 daily ATRA treatments. scRNA-seq analysis indicated a reduction of neutrophils as well as an enrichment in T cell and natural killer (NK) cell populations in the TME. Furthermore, scRNA-seq analysis revealed elevated expression of interferon (IFN) downstream genes in multiple immune subpopulations in the TME. Preliminary <i>ex vivo<\/i> studies indicated that ATRA increases NOX2 levels, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and IFN signaling in the myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) of KPL tumors.
