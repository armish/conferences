[{"Abstract":"Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is a keratinocyte-derived invasive and metastatic tumor of the skin. It is the second-most commonly diagnosed form of skin cancer, striking 200,000 Americans annually. Further, organ transplant patients are at significantly increased risk of cSCC compared to the general population. Excision of cSCC of the head and neck area results in significant facial disfigurement. An increased understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of cSCC could identify means to prevent, inhibit, and reverse this process. Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 17 (CXCL17) is the latest chemokine family member, and an increased CXCL17 protein expression was observed in both mouse and human cSCC cell lines. Further, deletion of CXCL17 was associated with significant inhibition of tumor cell-intrinsic properties such as proliferation, migration, and motility. CXCL17 is identified as a potent chemoattractant for macrophages, dendritic cells and myeloid-derived suppressive cells. Accordingly, utilizing a syngeneic, tumor-cell xenograft cSCC mouse model, we evaluated the effect of CXCL17 deletion on cSCC tumor-immune evasion and elucidated the underlying mechanism. Deletion of CXCL17 was associated with a significant reduction in tumor volume compared to the wild-type counterparts. Further, CXCL17 deleted cSCC tumor cell xenografts exhibited a significant increase in CD8+, cytotoxic T cells in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting an important role of CXCL17 in mediating tumor-immune evasion. Interestingly, treatment with CXCL17 induced macrophage M2 polarization and promoted macrophage efferocytosis <i>via<\/i> modulating efferocytotic machinery proteins such as MERTK, TIM4, GAS6 and AXL. Our studies have established substantial evidence for the role of CXCL17 in modulating tumor-cell extrinsic properties to affect the progression of cSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chemokines,Skin carcinogenesis,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alok R.

A new and unexpected function for TSLP has been found in the induction and progression of a variety of tumors. This study conducted TSLP performance in lung cancer patients and the correlation of the clinical pathological data.<br \/>Materials and Methods: The patients with pathological diagnosis of lung cancer were enrolled. The percentage of CD19 + B cells was determined in the lymphocyte gate and counted via flow cytometry. Relevant serum cytokines including TSLP were analyzed using LEGENDplex software. In vitro study was conducted by A549 cell line and the mRNA expression change of TSLP was extracted by Reverse Transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR).<br \/>Results: When comparing the frequencies of B cell subsets between early-stage (N = 31) and late-stage lung cancer group (N = 29), the frequency of memory B cell (17.3&#177;6.1% vs 23.4&#177;15.1%, p=0.042), CD27+IgM+ B cell (1.8&#177;1.3% vs 2.9&#177;2.3%, p=0.030), class-switched B cell (15.5&#177;5.5% vs 22.2&#177;14.9%, p=0.023), class-switched memory B cell (69.9&#177;11.3% vs 59.9&#177;19.7%, p=0.017) and plasmablast (8.5&#177;7.3% vs 18.0&#177;20.8%, p=0.019) were significantly different between groups. The patients with higher frequency of class-switched B cell had significantly worse prognosis than low frequency (HR 3.054, 95% CI 1.007-9.262, p=0.049). The level of IL-1B, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, and TSLP were significantly higher in the late-stage cancer patients. Simulation in vitro test with human lung A549 cell line was performed, the expression of short-form TSLP (sfTSLP) level decreased with the higher anti-cancer drug as Pemetrexed concentration.<br \/>Conclusions: The increase proportion of CD27+CD38- (class-switched) B cell could be an independent, poor prognostic factor for NSCLC patients. TSLP signaling is addressed to the anti-cancer therapeutic response. Therefore, TSLP and relevant cytokines may be involved directly and indirectly in shaping the inflammatory status of the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,T cell,Lung cancer: non-small cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chung-Yu Chen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ying-Yin Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Hung-Chueh Peng<sup>1<\/sup>, Yi-Ling Ye<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>National Taiwan University Hospital Yunlin Branch, Douliu, Taiwan,<sup>2<\/sup>National Formosa University, Huwei Township, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2732b0a1-9d14-47d4-936d-0625a280b6ad","ControlNumber":"2636","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

Based on multicentral single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, we have identified SRY-Box Transcription Factor 4 (SOX4), an essential developmental transcription factor, is specifically and highly expressed by NPC cells and contributes to tumor growth and distant metastasis. SOX4 upregulation also promotes ZIP14-mediated intracellular zinc uptake, leading to competitive deprivation of free zinc in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which inhibits zinc-dependent T cell receptor (TCR) activation. Thus, our study provides experimental insights into how NPC develops and evades immune surveillance.<br \/>Methods: scRNA-seq data and bulk RNA-Seq data from our lab and GEO database were integrated and analyzed on a bioinformatic basis. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed to validate the SOX4 protein level in an independent clinical cohort. Cell lines, patient-derived xenografts, and humanized mouse models were generated to evaluate the <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i> function of SOX4. Flow cytometry was used for T-cell immunophenotyping. Immunoprecipitation was used to study protein-DNA interaction. The dual-luciferase reporter assay was utilized to demonstrate the transcriptional regulation of SOX4 on the ZIP14 promoter. qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence staining were also employed for functional studies.<br \/>Result: Our transcriptome analysis showed SOX4 was frequently overexpressed by NPC cells, compared to infiltrating immune and stromal cells. Increasing SOX4 expression in normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cells enhanced proliferation, stemness, migration, and invasion. SOX4 also transcriptionally upregulated ZIP14 in NPC cells which promoted the uptake of free zinc from the TME. Thus, competitive deprivation of zinc between NPC cells and T cells in the TME inhibited TCR signaling and T-cell cytotoxicity, leading to NPC immune evasion.<br \/>Conclusion: This study reveals the SOX4-ZIP14-Zinc axis as a vital mechanism for simultaneously inducing tumor development and immunosuppression in the NPC microenvironment. Therapeutic inhibition of SOX4 or ZIP14 is a new strategy for NPC patients and potentially synergizes with PD-1\/PD-L1 blockades to overcome immunosuppressive signals in the TME.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Immuno-oncology,Zinc,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yuma Yang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lanqi Gong<sup>1<\/sup>, Jie Luo<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaona Fang<sup>1<\/sup>, Jiao Huang<sup>1<\/sup>, Lu Bai<sup>1<\/sup>, Qin Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Beilei Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Shan Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Jinlin Huang<sup>1<\/sup>, Ching Ngar Wong<sup>1<\/sup>, Baifeng Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Danyang Zheng<sup>1<\/sup>, Yu Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Wei Dai<sup>1<\/sup>, Xinyuan Guan<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Clinical Oncology, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong,<sup>2<\/sup>State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4f2621d0-aa0d-4edb-a487-0d6291187af5","ControlNumber":"2621","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Despite numerous advancements in therapies to treat melanoma, a prevalent population of patients still do not respond to currently approved therapies. Recent studies have highlighted the role of transcription factor nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) in melanoma for cancer survival, invasion, and metastasis. NR4A1 is also involved in glucose metabolism. Our project aims to identify an effective degrader of NR4A1 using a PROTAC strategy and then validate its effectiveness in reducing the growth of melanoma. PROTACs consists of three domains: a warhead that binds to the protein of interest, a ligand to an E3 ligase, and a linker that brings both domains in proximity to one another. The PROTAC can recruit an E3 ligase to ubiquitinate NR4A1 and degrade it via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Our first goal was to identify valid PROTAC candidates that can effectively degrade NR4A1. We identified NR-V04, which demonstrated a dose-dependent degradation of NR4A1 in various melanoma cell lines. We further investigated time-dependent degradation, and NR-V04 was able to achieve <i>in vitro <\/i>degradation of NR4A1 16 hours after treatment. Additionally, we validated the mechanism of degradation via the UPS through various models. NR-V04 treatment of cells with a VHL knockout, which removes the E3 ligase recruited, experienced no degradation of NR4A1, and treatment of cells treated with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, also showed no degradation. We observed degradation <i>in vitro<\/i> of numerous mouse and human cell lines. To investigate the cancer-killing effects of NR-V04, we completed MTS assays on the human melanoma cell lines CHL1 and A375, which showed an EC50 of 0.723 &#956;M and 1.025 &#956;M, respectively. When comparing NR-V04 treated and untreated CHL1 cells, NR-V04 was able to significantly decrease melanoma cell viability. NR4A1 knockout in CHL1 also showed decreased melanoma cell viability, and when comparing NR-V04 treated and untreated in NR4A1 knockout, there was no further decrease in melanoma cell viability. As for <i>in vivo <\/i>models, NR4A1 knockout in CHL1 and A375 exhibited slower tumor growth compared to the wild type. Furthermore, NR-V04 showed suppression of CHL1 and A375 tumor-bearing NSG mice melanoma growth at low dose concentrations of 1 mg\/kg after seven days compared to vehicle and warhead treatment. Western blot analysis of tumor tissue provides support for the ability of NR-V04 to degrade tumor-intrinsic NR4A1. <b> <\/b><br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>NR-V04 can selectively degrade NR4A1, <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i>, to decrease melanoma cancer cell viability via the UPS.

However, little is known about the potential relationships between the tumor immune microenvironment and systemic inflammatory markers including NLR. Here we have explored systemic and tumor-immune microenvironmental characteristics related to treatment outcomes of immune checkpoint inhibition, based on 29 consecutive patients with recurrent\/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who received pembrolizumab between 2020 and 2021. NLR greater than 4.5 at pretreatment status significantly correlated with short overall survival (OS). Although NLR did not show a significant association with tumor volumes, high NLR exhibited significant correlations with malnutrition status characterized by CONUT (controlling nutritional status), and GNRI (geriatric nutrition risk index). Among the patients whose NLR was greater than 4.5 at pretreatment status, those whose NLR decreased to less than 4.5 at day 21 had a better OS than those whose NLR did not decrease, indicating that longitudinal changes in NLR correlate with prognosis. To investigate association with tumor-immune microenvironment, 14-marker multiplex immunohistochemistry was performed to quantitatively evaluate intratumoral CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, helper T cells, regulatory T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, and granulocytes. Notably, NLR at pretreatment status significantly correlated with intratumoral immune cell densities, where high NLR correlated with low lymphoid cells and high tumor associated macrophages in tissue. NLR in peripheral blood significantly correlated with myeloid to lymphoid cell ratios in tissue, suggesting the presence of association between circulating and intratumoral immune complexity profiles. This study highlights that the association between intratumoral myeloid predominance and systemic nutritional and inflammatory status might be a possible factor for resistance to immunotherapy. Understanding immune dynamics in tissue and blood during immunotherapy potentially contributes to the establishment of predictive biomarkers and monitoring for immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Tumor microenvironment,Immune checkpoint blockade,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hiroki Morimoto<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Takahiro Tsujikawa<sup>1<\/sup>, Aya Miyagawa-Hayashino<sup>2<\/sup>, Alisa Kimura<sup>1<\/sup>, Sumiyo Saburi<sup>1<\/sup>, Junichi Mitsuda<sup>1<\/sup>, Kanako Yoshimura<sup>1<\/sup>, Gaku Ohmura<sup>1<\/sup>, Shigeyuki Mukudai<sup>1<\/sup>, Hikaru Nagao<sup>1<\/sup>, Yoichiro Sugiyama<sup>1<\/sup>, Shibata Saya<sup>3<\/sup>, Hiroshi Ogi<sup>4<\/sup>, Eiichi Konishi<sup>2<\/sup>, Kyoko Itoh<sup>4<\/sup>, Shigeru Hirano<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Surgical Pathology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>SCREEN Holdings Co., Kyoto, Japan,<sup>4<\/sup>Pathology and Applied Neurobiology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2cf92ee4-9a00-402d-b661-3c99652aa103","ControlNumber":"2607","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

However, even in lung cancer, the response rate for anti-PD1 therapy (for example) does not exceed 20%. Thus, it is critical to identify mechanisms that block the response to immune checkpoint therapies. STK11 (also known as LKB1) is encoded by the serine threonine kinase 11 gene (<i>STK11<\/i>). Patients harboring tumors with <i>STK11<\/i> mutations have reduced infiltrates of cytotoxic T-cells and clinical studies have shown that they respond poorly to anti-PD1 or anti-PDL-1 therapies regardless of PDL-1 status, which otherwise predicts benefit. Herein, we have used gene expression data from a cohort of 442 lung adenocarcinoma patients to identify CX3CL1 (fractalkine) as a gene silenced in <i>STK11<\/i> mutant tumors with potential to be a key direct modulator of the immune system relevant to STK11 loss. To further explore this hypothesis, we have edited the <i>STK11<\/i> gene in A549 cells back to wild type (<i>STK11<\/i> corrected). As predicted, restoration of STK11 function resulted in modest expression of CX3CL1 as measured by Western blotting. Unexpectedly, exposure of <i>STK11<\/i> corrected cells to human immune cells isolated from the blood of healthy donors resulted in a 5 to 10-fold increase in CX3CL1 suggesting interactive signaling between tumor and immune cells. Using transwell assays and <i>STK11<\/i> corrected A549 cells we find that restoration of functional STK11 increases immune cell migration, adhesion and invasion in vitro. Finally, cytotoxicity assays demonstrate that <i>STK11<\/i> corrected A549 cells are 3 to 5-fold more sensitive to immune cell killing. Taken together these results suggest the hypothesis that CX3CL1 loss mediates immune evasion in <i>STK11<\/i> mutant lung adenocarcinomas. Future work will further explore the mechanisms underlying this pathway in preclinical models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune response,LKB1,Lung adenocarcinoma,Chemokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Eria Eksioglu<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Gabriela  M.

However, despite the evidence of an active immune response in OC, immune checkpoint blockade therapy has been ineffective. Recently studies have shown that deficiencies in the DNA damage response (DDR) can drive increased genomic instability and tumor immunogenicity. One target involved in the DDR that has the potential to be of therapeutic value is protein phosphatase 4 (PP4); however, the effect of PP4 deficiency on anti-tumor immunity remain unknown.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Our results show that PP4 inhibition combined with carboplatin leads to increased carboplatin sensitivity, DNA damage, and micronuclei formation. Using a panel of ovarian cancer cells, we show that PP4 inhibition triggers inflammatory signaling via NF-&#954;B and STAT1 activation resulting in increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IFN&#946;1, CCL5, CXCL10, and IL-6. Moreover, conditioned media from OC cells treated with the combination of PP4 inhibitor and carboplatin significantly increased migration of both CD8 T cell and NK cells over carboplatin treatment alone. Knockdown of STING in OC cells significantly abrogated the increase in CD8 T cell migration induced by PP4 inhibition. <i>PPP4C<\/i> or <i>PPP4R3B<\/i> knockdown resulted in strong induction of NK cell IFN-&#947;, increased degranulation, and increased NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against OC cells. Stable knockdown of PP4C in a syngeneic, immunocompetent mouse model of ovarian cancer resulted in significant reduction of tumor growth<i> in vivo<\/i>. PP4C low tumors had increased infiltration of CD161+ NK cells and CD4+ T cells. Addition of low dose carboplatin treatment in vivo led to increased CD8+ T cell infiltration in PP4C low tumors when compared to the untreated groups.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Our work has identified a role for PP4 inhibition in promoting anti-tumor immune activation.

Chronic inflammation, accumulation of genetic changes and alternations of the liver microenvironment are critical during the process of carcinogenesis and development of HCC. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS or NOS2)-derived NO and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) are important parts of the neoplastic inflammatory environment. Continuous exposure to moderate to high concentrations of NO, produced by inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and COX2, promotes neoplastic transformation, chemotherapeutic resistance, enhanced cell proliferation, increased inflammation and immune resistance. Our previous study reported that iNOS promoted stem-like characteristics and activation of liver cancer stem cells through Notch signaling pathway. iNOS activity in both the liver cancer stem cells and the microenvironment contributes to tumor progression in mice, suggesting that targeting iNOS in the entire tumor could have therapeutic benefit in HCC. iNOS-derived NO and COX2-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were shown to promote feed-forward iNOS\/COX2 crosstalk because NO induced COX2 and PGE2 induced NOS2. Our research showed that iNOS inhibition with the iNOS inhibitor (1400W) and COX2 inhibitor (Celebrex) diminished HCC tumor growth. The cytokine analysis revealed considerably lower levels of inflammatory cytokines including, IL-6, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP1), macrophage inflammatory protein-3alpha (MIP-3alpha), IL-1B, CC chemokine subfamily of eosinophil chemotactic proteins eotaxins (CCL11), M-CSF, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC, CCL17) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in HCC with iNOS\/COX2 inhibition. iNOS\/COX2 levels influence the polarization and spatial location of lymphoid cells including CD8+ T cells. Targeting iNOS\/COX2 blockade improved CD8+ T cell penetration into the tumor core. We also found that iNOS\/COX2 blockade result in more CD4+ T helper cells and CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL), but reduce the number of exhausted CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells (PD1-high, Lag3+, CD39+ Tex). The results suggesting that iNOS\/COX2 inhibitor therapy may alleviate HCC growth by promoting a anti-tumorigenic TME, modifying lymphoid spatial localization and gene expression phenotypes and decreasing T-cell exhaustion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,iNOS,COX2,PDL1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ronghua Wang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Christof Kaltenmeier<sup><\/sup>, Ruiqi Yang<sup><\/sup>, Tony Haykal<sup><\/sup>, Hamza Yazdani<sup><\/sup>, Celine Tohme<sup><\/sup>, David Geller<sup><\/sup>, Samer Tohme<sup><\/sup>, Timothy Billiar<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ffe03f64-af24-427f-8be0-54d057072e99","ControlNumber":"5558","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.

Such limitation restricts therapeutic doses and adversely affects patient quality of life while undergoing and following treatment. ONC201\/TIC10 is a small-molecule anti-cancer drug that activates the integrated stress response (ISR) and drives the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) pathway. Pegylated recombinant long-acting TRAIL (TLY012) has been shown in preclinical models to induce the reversal of fibrosis and currently has orphan drug status for systemic sclerosis and chronic pancreatitis. We show a similar effect of both TLY012 and ONC201 in vivo in protecting from radiation pneumonitis and fibrosis of the lungs. WT and TRAIL-\/- C57Bl\/6 mice receiving a single 20 Gy thoracic radiation dose with shielding of other organs and treated with 10 mg\/kg of TLY012 twice a week showed a significantly reduced alveolar wall thickness and lessened inflammation compared to controls and DR5-\/- mice receiving the same treatment upon histological analysis of the lungs conducted 13 days post-irradiation. WT and TRAIL-\/- C57Bl\/6 mice treated with 100 mg\/kg of ONC201 once a week showed similar effect to a lesser extent. Further analysis in C57Bl\/6 WT mice bearing orthotopic mammary fat pad e0771 TNBC tumors similarly receiving a single 20 Gy thoracic radiation dose revealed the same pattern of protection from radiation pneumonitis upon TRAIL-pathway agonism through treatment with TLY012 and ONC201 both in combination and alone, while also showing a significant reduction in tumor burden at the experimental endpoint (day 9 post-irradiation) in the combination treated mice. Further, pulse oximetry readings of the hind paw revealed a notable reduction in oxygen saturation in all mice except those treated with TLY012. Cytokinomic profiling of mouse serum upon sacrifice revealed a significant reduction in CCL22\/MDC levels in the TLY012 cohort. Additional post-hoc analysis including immunophenotyping, immunostaining, and bulk RNA analysis through Nanostring nCounter technologies is underway. Altogether, these findings suggest a role for TLY012, ONC201, or broader modulation of the TRAIL\/DR5 pathway in mitigating adverse effects and outcomes of therapeutic radiation, and may serve as a foundation for safer use of radiation in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation therapy,TRAIL,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jillian  R.

An unusual occurrence of iMCD in identical twins provided a unique opportunity to answer genetic and molecular features of this disease, including the cell-of-origin of IL-6 signals, and the immune milieu within affected lymphoid organs and in circulation. Germline whole genome sequencing of the affected twins identified pathogenic homozygous mutations of <i>NCOA4<\/i> c.G1322A and monoallelic mutations of <i>TRAF3<\/i> c.G1504A - both genes recently implicated in IL-6 signaling and B-cell regulation. Their unaffected sister was heterozygous mutant for <i>NCOA4<\/i> and homozygous wildtype for <i>TRAF3<\/i> loci. Via single cell sequencing of 63,519 cells from bone marrow, lymph node, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we identified nodal endothelial cells and fibroblastic reticular cells (FRC) as the source of IL-6 signals. The latter are composed of mainly T-cell zone FRCs (CCL19+\/CCL21+\/IL7+\/PDPN+\/MADCAM1-) and a minor population of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) (CD21+\/CD35+\/CXCL13+). An &#8220;inflammatory&#8221; peripheral monocytosis enriched for the expression of S100A family genes was evident in both twins, as well as a group of monocytes expressing cytotoxic gene signatures in the affected twin with milder clinical manifestations. Their unaffected sister mainly carried monocytes enriched for expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes. In conclusion, we provided evidence of a genetic cause of iMCD, identified the putative cell-of-origin of IL-6 signals in this rare disease, and described a distinct monocytic immune response phenotype.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Genetic factors,Hereditary cancer,B cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jason Yongsheng Chan<sup>1<\/sup>, Jui Wan Loh<sup>1<\/sup>, Jing Quan Lim<sup>1<\/sup>, Herty Liany<sup>1<\/sup>, Elizabeth Chun Yong Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Jing Yi Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Bavani Kannan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Boon Yee Lim<sup>1<\/sup>, Kerry Lim<sup>1<\/sup>, Jeslin Chian Hung Ha<sup>1<\/sup>, Cedric Chuan-Young Ng<sup>1<\/sup>, Tun Kiat Ko<sup>1<\/sup>, Dachuan Huang<sup>1<\/sup>, Dominique Yuan Bin Seow<sup>2<\/sup>, Chee Leong Cheng<sup>2<\/sup>, Sock Hoai Chan<sup>1<\/sup>, Joanne Ngeow<sup>1<\/sup>, Bin Tean Teh<sup>1<\/sup>, Soon Thye Lim<sup>1<\/sup>, Choon Kiat Ong<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>National Cancer Centre Singapore, Singapore, Singapore,<sup>2<\/sup>Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2aeee532-a09a-4d9c-b6ab-81ba3d4e62af","ControlNumber":"5583","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

Here, we explored as to how the spatial localization of endothelial cells and leukocytes and their mutual interactions contribute to disease progression.<br \/>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES: We applied multiplexed fluorescence IHC (mfIHC) to quantify CD45+ leukocytes, CD31+ endothelial cells, D2-40+ lymphatic cells, CD11b+ myeloid cells, CD3+ and CD20+ lymphocytes, as well as PDGFRB+ fibroblasts and epithelial cells (CK+\/Ecadherin+\/CAIX+) in two cohorts of non-metastatic primary ccRCC. Both the Helsinki (N=178) and Turku cohorts (N=241) contained TMA cores from tumor center, tumor border, and benign areas of each patient. mfIHC data were compared with clinical parameters, such as tumor stage (pT), Fuhrman grade, necrosis, and patient outcome (RFS, recurrence-free survival).<br \/>RESULTS: CD31+ endothelial cells were associated with favorable (p&#60;0.001) and CD45+ leukocytes with poor prognosis (p&#60;0.001), high pT (p&#60;0.05), high Fuhrman grade (p&#60;0.05), and high necrosis (p&#60;0.05) in TMA cores representing the tumor center and tumor border areas. CD45+ cells varied spatially with regards to CD31+ cells and EpiStain+ cells. For example, in tumor center cores, CD45+ cells co-localized with EpiStain+ cells ranging from 0.1 to 97% (median for both cohorts, 70.6% and 72.5%). The association of CD45+ leukocytes with poor prognosis was significant when counting the fraction of CD45+ cells not interacting with CD31+ or EpiStain+ cells, but not when including only the interacting cells. We then categorized patients into three classes based on the quantity of the cell types: 1) CD45<sup>+High<\/sup>\/CD31<sup>+Low<\/sup>, 2) CD45<sup>+Low<\/sup>\/CD31<sup>+High<\/sup>, and 3) Other. CD45<sup>+High<\/sup>\/CD31<sup>+Low<\/sup> phenotype patients had a significantly lower 5-year RFS rate compared to that of CD45<sup>+Low<\/sup>\/CD31<sup>+High<\/sup> patients (Helsinki: 37.9% vs. 92.0%; Turku: 50.0% vs. 93.5%; p&#60;0.001, Log-rank test).<br \/>CONCLUSIONS: In ccRCC, both the quantity and spatial localization of inflammatory cells with respect to vascular endothelial cells and tumor cells dictates its association with patient prognosis. Our results suggest that although CD45+ leukocyte infiltration associates with recurrent disease, the higher risk is only observed when CD45+ cells are not in contact with vasculature or tumor cells. This suggests how analysis of well-known prognostic biomarkers by IHC can be refined by using mfIHC and considering the spatial configurations of cells in the TME in ccRCC. Ongoing work is aimed to add further profiling of additional TME cell subset associations with inflammation, prognosis, and therapy response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Immune cells,Angiogenesis,Renal cell carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Teijo Pellinen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lassi Luomala<sup>1<\/sup>, Kalle Mattila<sup>2<\/sup>, Jenni Säilä<sup>1<\/sup>, Annabrita Hemmes<sup>1<\/sup>, Katja Välimäki<sup>1<\/sup>, Oscar Bruck<sup>1<\/sup>, Lassi Paavolainen<sup>1<\/sup>, Harry Nisen<sup>1<\/sup>, Petrus Järvinen<sup>1<\/sup>, Olli Kallioniemi<sup>1<\/sup>, Paula Vainio<sup>3<\/sup>, Panu Jaakkola<sup>3<\/sup>, Tuomas Mirtti<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Turku, Turklu, Finland,<sup>3<\/sup>University of Turku, Turku, Finland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"04812b94-5fad-4d58-bfba-84c832290834","ControlNumber":"6782","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;T.

Defining the immune landscape of these tumors and its spatial distribution will help to understand lung cancer biology. Here, we analyzed the distribution of immune-related biomarkers in tumor-defined regions and its associations with clinicopathological variables in resected lung adenocarcinomas using high-plex profiling approaches.<br \/><b>Methodology:<\/b> Thirty-three FFPE tumor tissues from surgically resected treatment-na&#239;ve lung adenocarcinoma stage I\/II were used to construct a tissue microarray from the MD Anderson ICON cohort. We used three 1-mm core per patient [2 from central tumor (CT), and 1 from invasive margin (IM)] and performed the GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling protein protocol to assess 49 immune biomarkers. Pancytokeratin (panCK; epithelial), CD45 (immune) and SYTO 13 (nuclear) were utilized as morphology biomarkers. Regions of interests were placed in cores containing tumor, and segmented in &#8216;&#8221;Tumor (Tu)&#8221; (PanCK+) and the &#8220;tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8221; (PanCK-). Digital counts were normalized using background correction. Statistical analysis was performed using linear mixed model. A p value equal or less than 0.05 was considered significant.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We first compared the relative counts of immune biomarkers in the TME in CT and IM. IM had higher CD3, CD8, CD45RO, as well as CD163 and STING (P ranges 0.006 to 0.035), while CT had higher PD1 (P 0.025). Then we analyzed differential biomarker expression by sex and smoking status. Females had higher counts of Immune related biomarkers: CD45, CD3, CD20, immune checkpoints: PD-L1, VISTA, CTLA4, LAG3, and ICOS, and myeloid: CD68, CD11c, CD163, and B2M (P ranges 0.0005 to 0.046). Smokers had higher counts of CD66b (P 0.007) and B2M (P 0.039) while never smokers had higher counts of HLA-DR, CD34, FoxP3, OX40L, Tim-3, and B7-H3 (P ranges 0.001 to 0.049). Finally, we analyzed Tu segments. IM had higher CD66b, VISTA, CD163, OX40L, HLA-DR, GZMB, STING, and CD8 (P ranges 0.007 to 0.045) than CT. Female patients had higher CD45, CD68, CD11c and CD163 (P ranges 0.008 to 0.045) , and males had higher SMA (P 0.005). Smokers had higher CD66b (P 0.007), B2-microglobulin (P 0.043), and never smokers had higher HLA-DR, STING, CD34, CD44, FoxP3 and CD25 (P ranges 0.006 to 0.043).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b> In this study, biomarker analysis of treatment-na&#239;ve adenocarcinoma in CT areas and IM indicates a higher immune response in the IM and presence of inhibitory signaling inside the tumor. Our data also showed that tumors from females have higher immune response than tumors from males, which is concordant with previous studies. Distinct profiling by smoking status was also observed.

Beyond its importance in leukemia and lymphoma, scientists now understand that the immune system is involved in virtually all malignancies. Heterogeneity of cell phenotypes within a tumor microenvironment, including blood cell phenotypes, is a hallmark of cancer that is poorly understood. Resolution of these phenotypes is essential to direct therapeutic development. CyTOF&#174; technology has pioneered the field of high-dimensional flow cytometry through the use of isotopically pure metal-tagged antibodies and a highly sensitive mass cytometer to enable 50-plus-parameter analysis. Easy panel design without the need for compensation controls or issues of autofluorescence allows for comprehensive single-cell analysis in complex biological samples and is particularly well suited for revealing the intricacies of oncogenesis. Maxpar&#174; OnDemand reagents were recently introduced for CyTOF to increase flexibility and facilitate larger panel design in a short period of time. To this end, lineage markers that have strong, reliable expression were reassigned to optimal metal isotopes to reserve the high-sensitivity lanthanide channels for more difficult-to-detect markers with low endogenous expression, common in immuno-oncology studies. In this study, we aimed to test the newly released Maxpar OnDemand&#8482; Antibodies to create an optimized immune phenotyping panel and maximize further customization for CyTOF. Individual antibody performance was compared between the new and existing antibodies with different metal tags. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and fresh whole blood (WB) were stained to confirm equivalent capabilities for population gating. Importantly, we demonstrated the power of these antibodies to generate reproducible, impactful data by creating functional human immunophenotyping panels. A 20-marker human phenotyping panel was tested in PBMC and WB. We identified major immune cell populations including T cells, B cells, granulocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and monocytes. Furthermore, the addition of CD45RO to the panel enhanced the delineation of naive, memory and effector T cell subsets. Additional myeloid markers were included to resolve the complexity within this compartment. With the updated placement of key lineage markers, the optimized phenotyping panel is ideal for future immuno-oncology studies as it can be easily expanded to interrogate cell cycle proteins, cytokines, cell signaling proteins, and oncogenic transcription factors. This work demonstrates the capability of CyTOF for robust, high-parameter immunophenotyping and a high degree of flexibility to expand our understanding of the complex processes underlying carcinogenesis and response to therapy.

Given that CAFs can promote immunosuppression in cancer, the aim of our study was to investigate the effect of NNMT-expressing CAFs on the tumor-immune environment.<br \/>Using a co-culture system of normal fibroblasts and activated PBMCs, we found that IFN-&#947; produced by PBMCs upregulates NNMT expression in fibroblasts. We confirmed this mechanism <i>in vivo<\/i> in IFN-&#947; knockout mice and identified T cells as the main source of IFN-&#947; in the tumor. Gene expression and protein analysis showed that upregulation of NNMT in CAFs induces the secretion of the chemokine CXCL1, a critical chemoattractant for immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Upregulation of NNMT induces CXCL1 secretion directly through promoter hypomethylation, and <i>in vitro<\/i> migration assays show that NNMT-expressing CAFs recruit high numbers of MDSCs. Using spectral flow cytometry, we analyzed the tumor-immune cell infiltration in whole-body NNMT-knockout mice and discovered that NNMT knockout of the stroma significantly reduced the abundance of MDSCs and increased the number of functional CD8+ T cells. Increased T cell cytotoxicity was associated with a significant reduction in tumor burden in the syngeneic ID8 ovarian and MC38 colon cancer models. These findings were confirmed after adoptive transfer of NNMT-wildtype immune cells into irradiated whole-body NNMT-knockout mice. Moreover, in scRNA-seq data of various human malignancies, we found a strong correlation between NNMT and CXCL1 expression in CAFs.<br \/>In summary, our results support a model in which cancer cells induce IFN-&#947; secretion by T-cells, thereby upregulating NNMT expression in fibroblasts, leading to CXCL1 secretion. CXCL1 secreted by CAFs recruits MDSCs to the tumor, which in turn suppress the anti-tumor T cell response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer associated fibroblasts,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,Cytotoxic T cells,NNMT,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Janna Heide<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Andras Piffko<sup>2<\/sup>, Agnes J.

In spite of the fact, the mechanisms underlying the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) remain unclear, and discovery of the biomarker predicting therapeutic efficacy of ICIs is urgently required. Our previous study indicated that in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treated with nivolumab, circulating T cells showed dynamic alterations depending on treatment efficacy using flow cytometry and mass cytometry. However, these analyses are somewhat complicated to apply each patient in clinical setting. In this study, we focused on systemic inflammatory markers, including inflammatory makers such as blood cell fractions and C-reactive protein(CRP) in peripheral blood. Firstly, we assessed the pretreatment systemic inflammatory markers in 61 recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer patients treated with nivolumab, and determined whether these markers were associated with treatment responses by Kaplan-Meier method, multivariate analysis, regression analysis and classification and regression trees(CART). Next, we investigated circulating T cell subsets in 36 recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer patients using flow cytometry. High neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio(NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio(PLR), and systemic immune-inflammation index(SII) significantly associated with poor prognosis in overall survival (NLR: <i>p<\/i>=0.0047, PLR: <i>p<\/i>=0.0357, SII: <i>p<\/i>=0.0011). Furthermore, high albumin, lymphocyte to monocyte ratio(LMR), and prognostic nutritional index(PNI) were significant good prognostic markers of overall survival (albumin: <i>p<\/i>=0.0037, LMR: <i>p<\/i>=0.0088, PNI: <i>p<\/i>=0.037). Overall survival time were estimated the values that were defined systemic inflammatory markers by multivariate analysis. These systemic inflammatory markers were assigned importance by each coefficient. Notably, the number of monocyte and lymphocyte have a strong influence on overall survival time. In addition, the index that were depending on the number of white blood cells and monocyte, the percentage of lymphocyte, platelet count, albumin, and PNI were useful prognostic tools in analyzing regression analysis. Furthermore, the evaluation of PNI were contributed to the predict treatment efficacy in analyzing CART. Moreover, NLR, PLR, and SII were positively correlated with the proportion of Treg (NLR: R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.3622\/<i>p<\/i>=0.0001, PLR: R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.4198\/<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.0001, SII: R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.3654\/<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.0001).

While tumors are frequently staged based on the presence or absence of TDLN metastasis, mechanisms for how tumors impact the TDLN microenvironment and immunologic responses are incompletely understood. Dogs with spontaneously arising tumors provide an opportune model to study immuno-oncology, sharing many similarities to human patients with their environment, clinical care, and pathobiology. To evaluate how tumors impact TDLN responses, we conducted single cell RNA sequencing (scSeq) on cryopreserved TDLNs of dogs with osteosarcoma (n=4) and healthy controls (n=2). We obtained an average of 3,984 cells per sample (range 1,603-5,259) with a total of 4,780 cells from healthy samples and 19,121 cells from TDLN samples. All samples were integrated into one dataset, then unsupervised clustering was completed. Each unique cell cluster was assigned an identity using canonical markers and reference mapping to human datasets. Following cell classification, we observed notable changes in gene expression across all cells isolated from the LNs, with most differences arising from changes to the transcriptome of myeloid cells. Although still preliminary, the data also demonstrate differences in the abundance of T, B, and myeloid cells between healthy and tumor draining LNs. Taken together, this dataset provides indications of the changes TDLNs undergo in dogs with osteosarcoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Lymph nodes,Single cell,Sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Samuel A.

Due to its desmoplasias along with the hypoxic state and scarce infiltration of T cells, PDAC is considered a cold tumor. Using a proteomic approach, we previously identified that the expression of endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductase 1 alpha (ERO1&#945;) is induced by hypoxia and correlates with reduced survival in PDAC. Furthermore, we observed an increased kynurenine formation under hypoxia, suggesting a role of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenases (IDO1) in PDAC. Since ERO1&#945; and IDO are involved in driving immune suppression through influencing the generation of immature myeloid cells, we sought to investigate whether inhibition of these pathways modulates the myeloid cell composition in PDAC. Using MiaPaCa2 as a PDAC spheroid model with hypoxic core grown in serum-free defined media and immune cell infiltration, we assessed the functional role of ERO1a with IDO1 in modulating monocyte infiltration and differentiation into pro- and anti-inflammatory phenotypes, followed by characterizing the immunomodulatory factors secreted using tandem mass spectrometry. Inhibition of ERO1a and IDO1 significantly improved U937 monocyte infiltration (p-value = ****) and differentiation into dendritic cells (p-value = ****). Secretome analysis of proteins identified with high false discovery rate (q-value&#60;0.01) revealed a downregulation of hypoxia and pancreatic cancer pathways in PDAC spheroids. In the presence of monocytes, upregulation of immune-related pathways for antigen presentation (15-fold) and myeloid cell maintenance signaling (2-fold) were observed. Moreover, specific immune-modulatory factors involved in immune infiltration and migration including interleukin 8, lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1 and transgelin-2 were upregulated at 27-, 20-, and 14-fold respectively. Taken together, these results indicate that inhibition of ERO1a and IDO1 drives an inflamed tumor microenvironment associated with improved monocyte infiltration and differentiation into dendritic cells to potentially enable T cell infiltration and killing of PDAC tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Immunosuppression,Monocyte,Dendritic cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Apple Tay<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Andreas Lundqvist<sup>1<\/sup>, Siu Kwan Sze<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Oncology-pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden,<sup>2<\/sup>School of Biological Science, Nanyang Technological University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e46b7aab-e7d1-4042-b7c6-b425c40834fd","ControlNumber":"218","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Smoker&#8217;s lung adenocarcinoma has consistently shown a favorable response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) than non-smoker&#8217;s lung adenocarcinoma. Comparing the macrophages (M&#981;) and dendritic cells (DC) constituting the innate immune tumor microenvironment (TME) in lung cancer of smokers and nonsmokers, we tried to figure out the difference in TME and biomarkers that predict the therapeutic response to ICIs.<br \/>Methods: The inflammatory TME of current and never smokers&#8217; lung cancer was explored by tumor and adjacent normal appearing lung tissues (Tu and NL hereafter) scRNA sequencing and verified by IF, IHC, and open-source dataset.<br \/>Results: Compared to lungs of nonsmokers, smokers&#8217; lung have an increased proportion of cell populations involved in innate immunity, and the increased cell population was mostly M&#981;, which were enriched in NL. When the number of M&#981; present in the NL of the corresponding individual were taken as the denominator, Tu of smokers has a lower proportion of M&#981; than that of non-smokers. Further sub-clustering of M&#981; and DCs showed that FCN1-mono and CD163-LGMN M&#981;, which correspond to the initial differentiation into the resident cell population within the tissue, and mo-DC, cDC2, and pDC were significantly enriched in the Tu. Among them, pDC is a functionally differentiated tissue resident cell that showed a different tissue distribution pattern between smokers and non-smokers, so it was estimated as one of the causes of the different treatment response to ICIs between the two patient groups. The difference of pDC&#8217;s distribution was further verified through IHC staining using anti-LILRA4 and anti-TLR9 antibody, showing pDC was significantly enriched in the smokers&#8217; TME. A significant increase in TLR9 expression was observed in or around lung cancer immediately after ionizing radiation or cisplatin treatment in LSL-Kras G12D mouse model. The survival analysis of TCGA-LUAD dataset showed that the patients' overexpressing pDC markers such as IRF4 and TLR9 was superior clinical outcomes to the age, gender and smoking matched control group. Comparing the difference in TMB between the top 25% and bottom 25% groups according to the expression of TLR9, it was 5.81\/Mb in the upper group and 4.36\/Mb in the subgroup, showing a significant difference.<br \/>Conclusions:<b> <\/b>pDC is an innate immune cell population that showed a prominent increase in smokers&#8217; TME compared to that of non-smokers, suggesting that its increase may be one the factors that smokers&#8217; lung cancer show favorable responses to ICI than that of non-smokers. These findings suggest that the pDC signature can be developed as a biomarker predicting the response to ICIs and increasing the number of pDCs or its activity may improve treatment outcome of ICIs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung adenocarcinoma,Dendritic cells,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Eun Young Kim<sup><\/sup>, Yoon Jin Cha<sup><\/sup>, Yong Jun Choi<sup><\/sup>, Min Kyung Park<sup><\/sup>, <b>Yoon Soo Chang<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"32303fb7-f518-4adf-bc56-bbf4090d83f2","ControlNumber":"162","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>E.

The causes of this chronic inflammatory-immunosuppressive state are still largely undefined. We hypothesized that selective RNAs can be secreted by cancer cells in extracellular vesicles (EVs) and may trigger proinflammatory responses in target cells, leading to chronic inflammation linked to immune cell dysfunction and immunosuppression. We found that tumor cell lines from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), prostate cancer (PCa) and from pediatric cancer such as Ewing sarcoma (EwS) continuously secrete large numbers of small (40-200 nm) EVs. In contrast to non-transformed fibroblasts, cancer cell-derived EVs are enriched with large subsets of retroelement and pericentromeric transcripts, including <i>LINE<\/i>, <i>SINE<\/i> and <i>HERV<\/i> retroelements, and human satellite 2 and 3 (HSAT2,3) RNAs. These virus-like RNAs were highly elevated in plasma EVs from EwS patients but not in healthy donors. Some of them, including <i>HERV-K <\/i>and<i> HSAT2<\/i>, were detected in peripheral blood myeloid cells with CD33<sup>+<\/sup>HLA-DR<sup>- <\/sup> immunosuppressive phenotypes, and these cell populations were expanded in EwS patients compared to healthy donors. Using mouse xenografts and <i>in vitro<\/i> models, we also found that at least some of these RNAs, such as <i>HSAT2<\/i>, are transmitted to stromal fibroblasts and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. They also accumulated in fibroblasts after treatment with EwS EVs, coincident with the induction of proinflammatory and DNA damage responses. Prolonged exposure of fibroblasts to EwS EVs also led to mitotic defects and senescence. Expression and dissemination of these highly immunogenic virus-like RNAs in EVs may thus be a common feature of multiple human malignancies, potentially affecting host cells in the local and systemic tumor environment. This, in turn, may induce chronic inflammation contributing to an overall immunosuppressed state in patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ewing sarcoma,Pancreatic cancer,Prostate cancer,Extracellular vesicles,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Valentina Evdokimova<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Peter Ruzanov<sup>1<\/sup>, Hendrik Gassmann<sup>2<\/sup>, Lincoln D.

In tumors, high levels of chromosomal instability can also lead to DNA fragments leaking into the cytosol to trigger PRR-mediated interferon response, resulting in pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion from the tumor. This could potentially expose tumor cells to immune attack. However, through mechanisms that are not completely understood, tumor cells dampen the interferon response to escape immune recognition. Previous work demonstrated that loss of ATG9A, but not ATG5, increased inflammatory signaling through the STING-IRF3 cascade, suggesting that perhaps an autophagy-independent function of ATG9A regulates inflammation. Here we found that loss of ATG9A or other upstream regulators of basal autophagy (e.g., ATG101), but not core LC3 lipidation machinery (ATG5 or ATG7), sensitizes cells to dsDNA-induced IRF3 activation and interferon gene expression. We also found that loss of ATG9A or ATG101, but not ATG5 or ATG7, increases the basal activity of the ubiquitin-sensing, IRF3-targeted kinase TBK1, which increases further upon dsDNA treatment. In these ATG9A and ATG101 deficient cells, TBK1 is clustered around large p62-positive condensates that previously been shown to contain large accumulations of LC3. Our preliminary data suggest a model in which ATG9A deletion causes the accumulation of LC3-positive membrane at p62 condensates, which may act as a platform for inflammatory signaling. Our current work focuses on identifying the upstream pathways and core mechanism that regulates IRF3 activation in ATG9A-deficient cells and exploiting this mechanism to improve anti-tumor immunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Autophagy,Interferons,Inflammation,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dasun  N.

However, the resulting health effects of e-cigarette use are still unclear. E-cigarette aerosols contain harmful and potentially harmful substances such as flavorings, carbonyl compounds, heavy metals, carcinogens and reactive oxygen species (ROS). A recent <i>in vitro<\/i> study from our laboratory showed that e-cigarette aerosols can increase cellular ROS and suppress cellular antioxidant capacity. An imbalance between the ROS production and the availability of antioxidants or free radical scavengers, can lead to chronic inflammation. Here we examine the effect of exposure to e-cigarette aerosols on the expression of the inflammatory regulator NF-kB and its downstream inflammatory targets in oral epithelial cells.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Human oral epithelial cancer (UM-SCC-1) cells were exposed, every other day for 2 weeks, to e-cigarette aerosol extracts (18 mg\/ml of nicotine; tobacco flavor) prepared from two distinct e-cigarette brands. Standard tobacco extracts were used as a positive control. Whole-cell RNA was isolated and processed for RNA-sequencing. The altered gene expression was further validated by western blotting and ELISA using a human cytokine array. Data were analyzed by Student's t-test.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> RNA sequencing data showed that a 2-week exposure of oral epithelial cells to e-cigarette aerosol extracts resulted in significant changes in several key cellular signaling pathways, including inflammatory and immune response signals. Exposure to e-cigarette aerosol extracts resulted in a significant increase in the expression of proteins involved in inflammatory pathways, such as TLR3, TGF beta, ERK1\/2 and NF-kB. We also observed a significant increase in pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines after exposure to e-cigarette aerosol extracts, including CD54, IL-1a and IL-10.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Our data suggest that chronic exposure to e-cigarette aerosol increases the expression of TLR3, TGF beta, and ERK1\/2, which possibly contributed to the observed increase in NF-kB and its down-stream targets (e.g., CD54, IL-1a and IL-10). NF-kB is a pleiotropic transcription factor with key roles in multiple biological processes, such as immune homeostasis and development. Chronic NF-kB activation by e-cigarette aerosol exposure could contribute to chronic inflammation and tumorigenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-09 Inflammation, immunity, and cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inflammation,NF-&#954;B,Cytokines,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Vengatesh Ganapathy<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jimmy Manyanga<sup>1<\/sup>, Dehra McGuire<sup>1<\/sup>, Daniel Brobst<sup>1<\/sup>, Balaji Sadhasivam<sup>1<\/sup>, Mayilvanan Chinnaiyan<sup>1<\/sup>, Constantin Georgescu<sup>2<\/sup>, Jonathan Wren<sup>2<\/sup>, Lurdes Queimado<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK,<sup>2<\/sup>The Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, OK","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"19cebed5-6fb1-4c3d-bcf3-de7d8e6a9c2c","ControlNumber":"7509","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>V.

This leads to hyperactive RAS signaling that predisposes NF1 patients to tumor development. Over time, some of these tumors can develop into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) which are currently incurable.Immune checkpoint blocking (ICB) programs a patient&#8217;s immune system to enhance tumor destruction. However, MPNSTs are cold tumors characterized by low immune cell presence in the tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, MPNSTs show checkpoint protein PD-L1 expression suggesting ICB as potential therapy for MPNST, given the ability to increase immune cell density in the tumor microenvironment. Activation of the intracellular receptor stimulator of interferon genes (STING) enhances antitumor immunity through the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including type I interferons. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is an enzyme that once bound to cytosolic DNA, synthesizes cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which activates STING to induce inflammatory cytokines and other immune mediators. Preclinical studies using mouse tumor models have assessed the efficacy of STING agonists that trigger the cGAS-STING-IFN axis, ultimately leading to augmented innate immunity and a T cell-rich tumor environment. Additionally, combining STING agonists with ICB has a synergistic effect in treating tumors. Therefore, we hypothesize that treatment with STING agonists would turn &#8220;cold&#8221; MPNSTs into &#8220;hot&#8221; tumors making them susceptible to targeting with ICB.<br \/>Methods: We treated MPNST cell lines with synthetic STING agonist ADU-S100 for varying durations of 8, 18, 24, and 48 hours. At the end of the treatment, cells were harvested for qRT-PCR and immunoblot analysis.<br \/>Results: We measured STING-IFN pathway activation through immunoblotting and observed that phosphorylation of STING effector proteins - a readout of STING activation -- was increased followingby 8 hours after treatment. qRT-PCR analysis showed that STING target cytokine\/chemokine gene expression was also upregulated by 8 hours after ADU-S100 treatment.<br \/>Conclusions: Theise data demonstrates that ADU-S100 was able to activate the STING pathway in MPNST cell lines leading to proinflammatory cytokine\/chemokine production. We will next test STING agonist in vivo use to determine whether ADU-S100 treatment inin mouse MPNST modelss of MPNST to is able to reprogram the tumor microenvironment into an immune inflamed one amenable to immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Ras,mRNA,PD-1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Laasya Madana<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Lu Q.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a traditional treatment for hematologic malignancies. Currently, CAR-T cell therapy has made a major breakthrough in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. However, the occurrence of acute Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) represents a major obstacle for HSCT and limits the application of CAR-T cell therapy.<br \/>GemPharmatech established and characterized two murine models for anti-GvHD drug evaluation. In the first model, bone marrow from C57BL\/6 donor mice was transplanted into a sublethally-irradiated BALB\/c recipient mouse. In this model, T cell infiltration, tissue damage, and systemic inflammation were observed, similar to the clinical observations of patients receiving allogeneic HSCT. Efficacy evaluation of anti-GVHD drugs have been carried out based on this model. Our results showed that treatment with the anti-GVHD drug Ibrutinib, the survival rate and the lifespan of the mice was significantly prolonged, and the GvHD score was reduced by about 70% compared with the placebo group.<br \/>In the second model, human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were transplanted into irradiated severe immunodeficient NCG mice. The cohort was irradiated to accelerate GvHD occurrence. The reconstructed human T cells will recognize and attack mouse tissues to cause GvHD. Our results showed that hCD45+ cells infiltrated into heart, liver, and spleen of huPBMC-NCG mice. This model has also been successfully used for anti-GvHD efficacy evaluation. Upon treatment with an anti-GVHD drug, the lifespan of huPBMC-NCG mice was significantly extended and weight loss was alleviated.<br \/>Overall, the above-mentioned GvHD models show great potential for preclinical evaluation of anti-GvHD drug development in allogeneic HSCT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,GvHD,HSCT,CRS,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Meirong Wu<sup>1<\/sup>, Shiru Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Fang Zhu<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Hongyan Sun<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jianming Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Cunxiang Ju<sup>1<\/sup>, Hongyu Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Santi Suryani Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Zhiying Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Mark Wade Moore<sup>2<\/sup>, Jing Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiang Gao<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Gempharmatech Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China,<sup>2<\/sup>GemPharmatech LLC., La Jolla, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c3a1e36e-fe9e-4c63-aaa8-1b1b790a04a8","ControlNumber":"4200","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.
