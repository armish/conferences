[{"Abstract":"<b>Purpose.<\/b> Resistance to radiation, both intrinsic and acquired, remains a significant clinical challenge. It is therefore import to identify the underlying molecular and cellular features involved in this resistance.<br \/><b>Materials and Methods.<\/b> We generated genetically-matched counterparts of various degrees of radiation sensitivity in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) tumor models to define characteristics of acquired resistance through repeated exposures to conventional X-ray radiation.<br \/><b>Results.<\/b> As assessed by cell viability and clonogenic assays murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and human A549 cell lines acquired an approximate 1.5 - 2-fold increase in radiation resistance (RR) as compared to its parental counterpart. Morphologically, we found that A549-RR exhibited a greater nucleus-to-cytosol (N\/C) ratio as compared to its respective counterpart. Since the N\/C ratio has been linked to the differentiation state, we next investigated the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and cellular plasticity. We found that A549 have a greater radiation-induced plasticity, as measured by E-cadherin, vimentin and double positive (DP) modulation, as compared to LLC. Additionally, migration was suppressed in A549-RR, as compared to A549. Subsequently, we confirmed that the LLC-RR and A549-RR are also more resistant to radiotherapy than their isogenic-matched counterpart <i>in vivo<\/i>. Remarkably, we found that the acquired radiation resistance also induced resistance to first-line chemotherapeutic cisplatin, but not carboplatin or oxaliplatin. This cross-resistance was attributed to induced elevated thiol levels. Decreasing the amount of thiols with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase inhibitor, sensitized the resistant cells to cisplatin, to levels similar as parental cells.<br \/><b>Conclusions.<\/b> By generating genetically-matched radiation resistant NSCLC tumor models we were able to identify and overcome cisplatin cross-resistance. This is an important finding arguing for multi-modality treatment regimens with the potential of improving clinical outcomes in the future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-06 Radiation-induced resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation therapy,Resistance,Carboplatin,Oxaliplatin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Samir V.

The recurrence rate of HGSOC after treatment is more than 80%. The available treatment options for HGSOC are limited; standard of care includes surgery combined with chemotherapy, with radiation therapy in some advanced cases. Both chemotherapy and radiation therapy are known to induce tumor cell aggressiveness. Many cancer studies have demonstrated that cancer stem cells (CSCs) and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) promote cancer aggressiveness, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. Therefore, to better understand the cause of the poor prognosis in HGSOC, our objective is to scrutinize the role of CSCs and EMT in chemo- and radiation resistance. To lead our inquiry, we utilized the SORE6 reporter to identify Sox2\/Oct4 expression, which indicates the stemness, and the Zeb1 3&#8217; UTR reporter to detect EMT. Using flow cytometry, we quantified the reporter activity in 10 ovarian cancer cell types, including chemo-sensitive and chemo-resistant ones, considering both cell lines and patient-derived cells. Chemo-resistant cells are grown under cisplatin treatment. We exposed some of these ovarian cancer cell lines to 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8Gy of 250 MeV proton and 6 MeV photon beams, then analyzed the reporter activity 72 hours post-radiation. Our findings exhibit that chemo-resistant cells express higher stemness and EMT levels than chemo-sensitive cells and have higher resistance to radiation. These reporters can detect radiation-induced stemness and EMT. Furthermore, stemness and EMT levels positively correlate with the radiation dosage increment. We conclude that these reporters are an efficient surrogate for detection of stemness and EMT and can be used to test strategies for prevention of therapy-induced aggressive phenotypes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-02 Interventional radiology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Radiation therapy,Chemotherapy,Gynecological cancers: ovarian,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yeonkyu Jung<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Aaron Keniston<sup>1<\/sup>, Ashley Antonissen<sup>1<\/sup>, Ann Morcos<sup>1<\/sup>, Antonella Bertucci<sup>2<\/sup>, Marcelo Vazquez<sup>2<\/sup>, Juli Unternaehrer<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Radiation Medicine, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics \/ Division of Biochemistry, Basic Sciences, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cf796e15-25e2-45b8-84f4-3995980f9d96","ControlNumber":"6586","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Cellular signaling pathways are tightly regulated to protect and withstand constant DNA-damaging insults. Similarly, pancreatic cancer cells are known to activate important metabolic events in the advent of cellular stress. Fuel sources obtained via the high metabolic flexibility of PDAC cells confer on them enhanced survival and the ability to escape therapy-induced cell death. To this end, we aim to dissect the role of altered metabolic reprogramming in radioresistant PDAC cells. Investigation of systemic metabolic changes post-radiation of 8Gy in <i>in vitro<\/i> systems revealed reduced total NAD\/NADH ratio and hinted at the increased dependency of PDAC cells on the one-carbon metabolic pathway. Using combinatorial stable-isotope tracing techniques, we confirmed the role of methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD1\/2) enzymes as key regulators in maintaining total NAD\/NADH ratio in irradiated cells. Moreover, inhibition of the one-carbon metabolic pathway hindered the ability of PDAC cells to resolve radiation-induced DNA damage. In summary, we propose that PDAC cells modulate the flux of MTHFD1\/2 enzymes to reprogram their metabolic state and generate intermediates for DNA repair and cell survival, thus establishing MTHFD1\/2 enzymes as potential therapeutic targets to tackle radioresistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Modification of radiosensitivity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radioresistance,One-carbon metabolism,Pancreatic cancer,Metabolic reprogramming,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Minal Nenwani<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Abhinav Achreja<sup>1<\/sup>, Olamide Animasahun<sup>2<\/sup>, Itisam Sarangi<sup>1<\/sup>, Jyotirmoy Roy<sup>1<\/sup>, Srinadh Choppara<sup>2<\/sup>, Fulei Wuchu<sup>2<\/sup>, Miya Paserba<sup>2<\/sup>, Anjali Mittal<sup>2<\/sup>, Sergio Quispe<sup>1<\/sup>, Aradhana Mohan<sup>2<\/sup>, Meredith Morgan<sup>2<\/sup>, Theodore  S.

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an inhibitor of purine synthesis, synergizes with radiation and temozolomide in mouse models of GBM. No measurements of purine synthesis have been performed in human cancer patients, nor has the purine inhibitor MMF been used clinically for patients with GBM.<br \/>Methods: We infused clinical-grade <sup>13<\/sup>C<sub>6<\/sub> glucose into patients undergoing craniotomy for presumed GBM and used mass spectrometry to measure carbon incorporation into purines in cortex and disparate tumor regions. We are conducting a phase 0\/1 trial (NCT04477200) to determine the safety and potential efficacy of the purine inhibitor MMF in patients with GBM. In the phase 0 arm, patients with recurrent GBM needing tumor re-resection receive MMF for one week prior to surgery and tumor and brain tissue is analyzed by mass spectrometry to determine drug concentrations and target engagement. In the phase 1 portions, patients (age &#62;18, KPS &#8805; 60) with recurrent GBM are treated with MMF and a second course of radiation while patients with newly diagnosed GBM are treated with radiation (RT), temozolomide (TMZ) and MMF followed by cyclic MMF and TMZ. A TITE-CRM algorithm is employed to dose-escalate MMF (range 500-2000 mg BID) and determine its maximum tolerated dose in combination with RT and\/or TMZ.<br \/>Results: Stable isotope tracing has been performed on 8 patients with suspected GBM. Purine synthesis was increased in tumor tissue compared to normal cortex in all patients, with most patients having 10-30-fold increased purine labeling in tumor. We have enrolled 8 patients on our phase 0 peri-surgical study and all had active concentrations of mycophenolic acid (the active metabolite of MMF) in enhancing and non-enhancing GBM tissue. We have enrolled 28 evaluable phase 1 patients (13 recurrent, 15 new). No dose-limiting toxicities have been observed with MMF (1000-2000 mg BID) in combination with re-irradiation or cyclic TMZ. In concurrent chemoradiation with MMF, we have observed two dose limiting grade 3 toxicities at 2000 mg, both improved with treatment break. Other main toxicities are mild nausea and fatigue. Interim median overall survival in recurrent phase 1 patients is 15.6 months, which compares favorably with typical survival time of 8-10 months in this population. In the newly diagnosed cohort, median survival is not yet reached, but 14 of 15 patients are alive and without progressive tumor.<br \/>Conclusions:<b> <\/b>Glucose-derived purine synthesis is elevated in human GBM compared to cortex, which could provide a favorable therapeutic index for purine synthesis inhibition. The purine synthesis inhibitor MMF achieves active concentrations in human GBM, is reasonably well tolerated in combination with standard GBM treatments, and is associated with promising preliminary clinical outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-04 Radiation-immunotherapy and other radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Radiation,Glioblastoma,Clinical Trial,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yoshie Umemura<sup><\/sup>, Andrew  J.

Pancreatic cancer is characterized by dense fibrotic stroma that constitutes up to 90% of the total tumor volume and contains extracellular matrix (ECM), immune cells, vasculature, and cancer-associated fibroblasts which are hallmark of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In present investigation we have tested anti-cancer effect of 3-BromoPyruvate (3-BP), an inhibitor of aerobic glycolysis employing Panc-2 cancer cells, and syngeneic pancreatic cancer mouse model. Panc-2 cancer cells treated with 40 uM of 3-BP showed significant inhibition in cell proliferation and ATP production. Cells treated with 60 uM dose level, showed drastic phenotypic changes (membrane blebbing) within 2 hours of treatment. The qRT PCR data showed 3BP inhibited hexokinase II (HK2) expression at 40uM, suggesting 3-BP regulate HK2 expression at transcriptional level. We also observed that 3-BP in combination with low doses of irradiation was more effective in killing cancer cells than 3-BP alone in both 2D and 3D culture model. Treatment of C57BL\/6 subcutaneous pancreatic tumor model with 10 and 20 mg\/kg of 3BP also showed significant reduction of tumor growth. The Transmission Electron Microscopy of tumor tissues treated with 3-BP revealed severely damaged mitochondrial structure which might have severely affected ATP generation in cancer cell. Altogether, the results in this study demonstrated that 3-BP could be a promising anti-tumor drug against pancreatic cancer and its efficacy could be improved in combination with radiation therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-04 Radiation-immunotherapy and other radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Radiation therapy,Mouse models,Antitumor agents,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sanjit K.

Our group and others have identified altered metabolism as a key mediator of GBM RT resistance. Methionine is an essential sulfur-containing amino acid that cells use to synthesize antioxidants, polyamines and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), which drives intracellular methylation reactions. Methionine uptake is dramatically elevated in GBM compared to normal brain, but what GBMs use this methionine for, and whether it governs GBM treatment resistance, is unknown. Here, we find that RT acutely increases the levels of numerous methionine-related metabolites in multiple RT-resistant GBM models. To interrogate metabolic pathway activity, we used 13C5 methionine stable isotope tracing to show that GBMs respond to RT by activating the conversion of methionine to SAM, which is dependent on signaling through the DNA damage response. We developed <i>in vivo<\/i> methionine stable isotope tracing techniques to confirm these findings in orthotopic PDX models of GBM. Blocking the conversion of methionine to SAM, through pharmacologic inhibition of methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A), slowed the repair of RT-induced DNA damage and increased cell death in GBM models following RT. These effects were especially pronounced in GBM models lacking the methionine salvage enzyme methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP). Pharmacologic inhibition of MAT2A in flank and orthotopic <i>in vivo<\/i> GBM models depleted SAM levels and slowed tumor growth when combined with RT. Combining MAT2A inhibition with dietary methionine restriction and RT slowed GBM tumor growth even further. Together, our work demonstrates a new signaling link between DNA damage and methionine-driven SAM synthesis in GBM. Inhibiting SAM synthesis slows the repair of RT-induced DNA damage and augments RT efficacy. This therapeutic strategy may be especially effective in GBMs defective in methionine salvage and spare normal cortex in which methionine salvage is active.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-06 Radiation-induced resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Glioblastoma,Radioresistance,DNA repair,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Navyateja Korimerla<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kari-Wilder Romans<sup>1<\/sup>, Peter Kalev<sup>2<\/sup>, Ayesha Kothari<sup>1<\/sup>, Nathan Qi<sup>1<\/sup>, Charles Evans<sup>1<\/sup>, Maureen Kachman<sup>1<\/sup>, Marc L Hyer<sup>3<\/sup>, Katya Marjon<sup>3<\/sup>, Taryn Sleger<sup>3<\/sup>, Daniel R Wahl<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI,<sup>2<\/sup>Agios Pharmaceuticals, Boston, MA,<sup>3<\/sup>Servier Pharmaceuticals, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9c48c0eb-eac7-4004-90c9-8d6248dc3373","ControlNumber":"6844","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

Although stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a viable treatment option in this context, disease progression remains far too common in PDAC. Understanding the interaction between radiation, cancer cells, and the tumor microenvironment (TME) may lead to an understanding of novel resistance pathways that can be exploited.<b> <\/b><br \/>In order to identify these potential nodes of therapeutic actionability, we leveraged a phase I\/II dose escalation clinical trial of SBRT with a radiomodulating agent, GC4419, undertaken in patients with locally advanced PDAC. In this trial, core biopsies were obtained following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but before and after SBRT with 50-60Gy in 5 fractions. A total of 16 biopsies underwent single cell RNA sequencing with 7 patients with matched samples before and after radiation.<br \/>Of the 7 matched patients, a total of 3 experienced early local progression following SBRT, and were deemed to be nonresponders. We observed a significant increase in NK-like cells and a decrease in B-cells and Mast cells following SBRT in nonresponders. On the other hand, we also observed a significant enrichment in pathways related to downregulation of innate immunity within macrophage populations following SBRT suggesting that an immunosuppressive microenvironment may prevail in these patients. Subsequently, we observed functionally distinct cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) subtypes, including myofibroblastic, inflammatory, and antigen presenting CAFs (apCAF). ApCAFs are believed to be involved in antigen presentation to CD4 T cells, but lack the costimulatory molecules to activate immune response, and are thus presumed to contribute to an immunosuppressive microenvironment through anergy. Interestingly, the population of apCAFs decreased significantly following SBRT in non-responders, and increased in those patients deemed to be responders. Thus whether apCAFs have an additional inflammatory role in the setting of patients receiving radiation remains to be further understood.<br \/>We have shown how single cell RNA sequencing can be used to profile the kinetics of cell populations following SBRT. This has revealed an interplay between members of the tumor microenvironment whereby immunosuppressive pathways appear to prevail over immunostimulatory signals in nonresponders. Understanding which pathways are enriched in those patients at highest risk for local recurrence may provide insight into novel therapeutic strategies that can be implemented concurrently with radiation therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-06 Radiation-induced resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Radiation therapy,Single cell,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Vincent Bernard<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Adnan Elhammali<sup><\/sup>, Daniel Lin<sup><\/sup>, Ching-Wei Tzeng<sup><\/sup>, Manoop  S.

Radiation therapy is an adjunct strategy throughout biliary tract cancer treatment. The aim of the study was to explore the efficacy and mechanism of the radiosensitization of surufatinib(SF), an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor with anti-angiogenic and immunomodulatory activities.<br \/>Methods: The NOZ and TFK1 human BTC cell lines were treated with SF and\/or radiation. Effects on cell viability and cell cycle progression were measured by CCK8, a clonogenic survival assay, and flow cytometry. Finally, the in vivo effect on the growth of NOZ xenografts was assessed in nude mice. F4\/80, CD206, Ki67 and CD31 expression were employed in tumor samples.<br \/>Results: SF inhibited the proliferation and enhanced the radiosensitivity in NOZ and TFK1 cells lines. SF combined with radiation increased cell cycle arrest in the G2\/M phase compared to the other treatments in the NOZ cell line (P&#60;0.05). Similarly, cell cycle arrest occurred in the TFK1 cell line, (P&#60;0.05). In vivo, SF plus radiation significantly inhibited the tumor growth compared to either agent independently.<br \/>Conclusions: SF significantly increased the radiosensitivity of NOZ and TFK1 cells in vitro and in vivo. Radiation combined with SF inhibited tumor proliferation, increased apoptosis, prolonged G2\/M arrest. SF decreased the number of blood vessels and reprogrammed the macrophages from M2 to M1.

Ionizing radiation (IR) is a double-edge sword for immunotherapy as it may cause both immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory effects. The interactions of IR with the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a key factor for this balance. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is expressed on the surface of CAFs in many cancer types and its presence is associated with poor immune response to immune checkpoint blockade in patients. We hypothesize that IR increases FAP expression in CAFs, therefore the combination of IR with targeted immunomodulators such as an agonistic FAP-41BBL bispecific antibody-like fusion protein could enhance the immune-mediated antitumoral effect of these treatments given in combination.<br \/>Methods: Murine transplantable tumor cells lines (TSA and MC38) were used to investigate increases in FAP expression on CAFs in tumors under irradiation using IHQ and qPCR. Established orthotopic transplanted models were used. We treated bilateral tumor-bearing mice in which only one of the lesions was locally irradiated (2&#215;6Gy) given alone or in combination with a systemic administration of the FAP-41BBL agonistic bispecific construct. Tumor sizes were followed over time and in the cellular composition microenvironment (TME) was assessed by immunochemistry and multiplex tissue immunofluorescence. Selective depletions of immune cell populations were used to delineate the immune system requirements for efficacy.We measured the changes in FAP expression following radiotherapy in engrafted syngeneic TSA and MC38 models using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and qPCR. TSA cells and CAFs were coinjected orthotopically creating bilateral tumor-bearing models, which were irradiated (2x6Gy) only inone of the lesions, either as a single treatment intervention or in combination with systemic administrations of FAP-41BBL. Treatment efficacy was evaluated measuring tumor volume and changes in the TME. Anti -D8 and a neutralizing anti-type-I IFN mAbs were used to define requirements for the efficacy of the radioimmunotherapy combination.<br \/>Results. Irradiation of TSA-breast cancer tumors showed clear increases of FAP expression levels after local irradiation. The suboptimal radiotherapy regimen chosen failed to control TSA-derived tumors in in which TSA-breast cancer cells had been co-engrafted with CAF. The combination of irradiation and FAP-41BBL resulted in more prominent increases of FAP expression after local irradiation and, importantly, induced durable complete responses in more than 50% of the mice treated with the combination. A role in the therapeutic effect for CD8+ T cells and type-I IFN was uncovered. Robust immune memory was observed in re-challenge experiments.<br \/>Conclusion. Our data provides a proof-of-concept and mechanistic insights pertaining the therapeutic efficacy of the bispecific FAP-41BBL fusion protein combined with local radiotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-04 Radiation-immunotherapy and other radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radioimmunotherapy,Immunotherapy,Fibroblasts,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Eneko Garate-Soraluze<sup>1<\/sup>, Irantzu Serrano-Mendioroz<sup>1<\/sup>, Carlos E de Andrea<sup>1<\/sup>, Toni Rullan<sup>2<\/sup>, Christina Claus<sup>3<\/sup>, Pablo Umana<sup>3<\/sup>, Christian klein<sup>4<\/sup>, Ignacio Melero<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Maria E.

The current standard of care for GBM consists of maximal safe tumor resection, chemotherapy (temozolomide) and radiotherapy followed by adjuvant temozolomide and Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields). Unfortunately, GBM displays both inherent and acquired resistance to temozolomide and radiation and is incurable. While TTFields have been found to broadly induce endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy, cell membrane permeability, DNA replication stress, anti-mitotic and anti-migratory effects, it is unclear how well TTFields impact radiation resistant GBM. To better understand the cytotoxic benefit of TTFields on acquired radiation resistant GBM, we tested patient-derived xenograft (PDX) brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs) that had been selected for radiation resistance and compared them to their radiation sensitive parent.<br \/>Methods: PDX were developed with subcutaneous implantation of patient GBM cells into immunodeficient (nu\/nu) mice. Acquired radiation resistant PDXs were generated through in vivo selection (6-8 passages) using six fractions of 2 Gray of radiation over two weeks. PDX BTICs were cultured on laminin-coated cover slips under serum free conditions. Cytotoxicity was measured on both the two-dimensional sham control and two-dimensional TTFields treatment conditions over the course of 72 hours and analyzed with crystal violet staining for both imaging and absorbance quantification. PamStation 12 Kinomic data and RNA-seq (Illumina) data was generated for each PDX.<br \/>Results: Crystal violet quantification and representative imaging indicated that TTFields inhibit cell growth in both parental and acquired radiation resistant PDX-derived BTICs. There is an observed TTFields sensitivity response from the acquired radiation resistant PDX, indicating that TTFields treatment does have a cytotoxic<b> <\/b>effect on acquired radiation resistant models (seen over four reproducible experiments). Baseline kinomic and transcriptomic differences between the PDX lines suggest potential TTFields sensitivity signatures.<br \/>Conclusions: Ongoing studies are focused on validation of this cytotoxic effect on larger cohort of both acquired and inherent radiation resistant PDX cells. We plan to measure TTFields -treatment induced kinomic alterations to identify downstream signaling pathways associated with TTFields treatment response, as well as the development of acquired TTFields resistant GBM PDX cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-06 Radiation-induced resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Tumor treating fields (TTFields),Radioresistance,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Taylor  L.

Radiotherapy produces single- or double-strand DNA breaks, while TTFields act on polarizable cellular structures. Thus, changing the incident electric field direction improves TTFields efficacy, killing 20% more tumor cells <i>in vitro<\/i>, with 90&#8304; changes in the front-back\/left-right (<i>x,y<\/i>) plane [1]. However, by the same logic, polarizable cell structures that are orthogonal to the (<i>x,y<\/i>) plane see 0 field strength and thus are unaffected by TTFields.

Thermoradiotherapy significantly increases complete response rate and provides a treatment modality for more aggressive forms of the disease for which treatment options are generally more limited. However, the cellular mechanism underlying hyperthermia-induced radiosensitivity remains unclear. To better understand this phenomenon, we analyzed microarray data from four cell lines following treatment at 45&#176;C for 30 minutes (Gene Expression Omnibus GSE48398). Three of the cell lines, MDA231 (37&#186;C, n=6; 45&#186;C, n=3), MDA486 (37&#186;C, n=6; 45&#186;C, n=3), and MCF7 (37&#186;C, n=6; 45&#186;C, n=6), were malignant breast cancer cell lines. The fourth cell line, MCF10A (37&#186;C, n=3; 45&#186;C, n=3), was from non-malignant mammary epithelial tissue. We identified 164 DEGs (adjP &#60; 0.05, Fold change &#62; 2) shared between the four cell lines and 182 DEGS shared by the three cancerous cell lines. Genes involved in radiosensitivity regulation as identified by dbCRSR, a database of radioresistance genes, were significantly dysregulated (Chi-squared test, p = 0.04). Gene ontology analysis using Cytoscape (v3.8.2) found 53 significantly enriched GO terms from an analysis off the DEGs (Benjamini-Hochberg adjP &#60; 0.05). In particular, DEGs were enriched in processes involving G2 cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA damage checkpoints (adjP&#60;0.005). We identified nine significantly enriched KEGG pathways, which included the ErbB (adjP=0.02), p53 (adjP=0.03), and PD-1 (adjP=0.02) cancer signaling pathways. We constructed a STRING protein-protein interaction network and then identified the 20 DEGs which had the greatest number of interactions. Identification of key genes in regulating hyperthermia-induced radiosensitivity were identified out of these 20 genes using two criteria: 1) overlap with two cancer signaling pathways and 2) involvement in radiosensitivity regulation. PTEN, a tumor suppressor overexpressed by up to 3.2-fold <i>in vitro <\/i>following hyperthermia, was identified as a key gene that may regulate hyperthermia-induced radiosensitivity in breast cancer. Distinct patterns of gene expression existed between breast cancer cells treated with hyperthermia and non-treated cells. Our data suggest that hyperthermia may exert its effects through arresting cells in the G2 phase, a particularly radiosensitive section of the cell cycle. Understanding the genes and pathways responsible for the heat-induced sensitization of breast cancer will allow us to exploit genetic alterations in tumors and develop non-invasive thermoradiotherapy regimens that more specifically target the tumor. Our study provides the basis for further investigation of genes regulating heat-induced radiosensitization and its molecular mechanism in breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-03 Modification of radiosensitivity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Hyperthermia,Radiosensitization,PTEN,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kevin Jili Tu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hong Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Dario Rodrigues<sup>2<\/sup>, Jason  K.

Consequently, all randomized Phase III clinical GBM trials attempting to integrate immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) have failed to demonstrate efficacy. We have recently shown that tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) reprograming via Bintrafusp alpha (Anti-PD-L1\/TGF-beta bispecific molecule) combined with conventional photon radiotherapy elicits beneficial effects and prolong survival in experimental models (Lan, Knoll, Moustafa et al. Cancer Cell 2021). Moreover, eradication of radioresistant i.e., stem cell like, invasive and hypoxic tumor subpopulations by high linear energy transfer (LET) carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) was shown to generate an immune permissive niche in experimental GBM models (Chiblak et al. JCI Insight 2019, Tang et al. IJRBP 2022). Therefore, we aimed to systematically study the effect of CIRT vs. conventional photon radiotherapy (RT) in two (GL261 and SB28) orhotopic syngeneic mouse GBM models.<br \/>Methods: Tumor growth monitoring was conducted longitudinally by means of bioluminescence and small animal MR-imaging. Mice were irradiated in five fractions (Fx) with a total dose of 15Gy RT vs. 5, 10 and 15Gy CIRT.<br \/>Results: Intriguingly, all GL261 harbouring mice were cured after 5x 3Gy Fx CIRT with no sign of tumor recurrence up to 80 days post irradiation. In contrast, no tumor control was found after 5x 3Gy Fx RT led despite a significant prolongation of OS. The tumor control probability 50% (TCP50) for CIRT in GL261 was estimated to be 10Gy in 5 Fx. To asses if the curative effect was related to tumor eradication or reconstitution of immune surveillance. GL261 tumor cells were implanted in the contralateral hemisphere of cured mice. Single cell and Bulk RNAseq as well as immunostaining were conducted to deconvolute TIME effects post CIRT.<br \/>Conclusions: In line with mechanistic studies, lack of tumor growth indicating persistent immunity against GL261 was found in CIRT cured mice. Similar experiments are conducted in SB28 model and will be presented. Together, these encouraging data indicate potential benefits for high-LET CIRT in immune modulation of GBM in experimental models that warrants for study and optimization towards clinical translation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-04 Radiation-immunotherapy and other radiotherapeutic combinations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiation therapy,Mouse models,Glioblastoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Federica Ciamarone<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sarah Meister<sup>1<\/sup>, Jennifer Furkel<sup>1<\/sup>, Maximilian Knoll<sup>1<\/sup>, Christian Schwager<sup>1<\/sup>, Jovana Bojcevski<sup>1<\/sup>, Yannik Streibel<sup>2<\/sup>, Christel Herold-Mende<sup>3<\/sup>, Michael Breckwoldt<sup>4<\/sup>, Juergen Debus<sup>5<\/sup>, Ivana Dokic<sup>1<\/sup>, Amir Abdollahi<sup>6<\/sup>, Katharina Schregel<sup>7<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Clinical Cooperation Unit Translational Radiation Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Heidelberg University Hospital (UKHD), German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) Core-Center, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Ion-Beam Therapy Center (HIT), Heidelberg, Germany,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Neuroradiology at the Neurology Center, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany,<sup>3<\/sup>Division of Neurosurgical Research, Department of Neurosurgery, Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Neuroradiology, Heidelberg University Hospital, DKTK Clinical Cooperation Unit Neuroimmunology and Brain Tumor Immunology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany,<sup>5<\/sup>Clinical Cooperation Unit Translational Radiation Oncology,NCT, UKHD, DKTK, HIRO, NCRO, DKFZ, Ion-Beam Therapy Center (HIT), Heidelberg Faculty of Medicine (MFHD), Heidelberg, Germany,<sup>6<\/sup>Translational Radiation Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Heidelberg, Germany,<sup>7<\/sup>Department of Neuroradiology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5dc4de72-ec84-45bf-a8ac-380ce4f9e65e","ControlNumber":"7459","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

Unfortunately, conventional radiation therapy cannot achieve ablative doses in the pancreas due to potential radiotoxicity to the nearby intestinal tissues. Thus, treatment-related gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity may be the most significant barrier to improving treatment responses for unresectable pancreatic cancer. There are no medications that can selectively protect the intestine from radiation damage, but we previously demonstrated that the genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of the EGLN prolyl hydroxylases protects murine intestines from radiation injury. To translate these findings to patients, we sought to test the EGLN inhibitor, FG-4592, and its mechanism of selective radioprotection in patient-derived intestinal organoids (also known as enteroids or mini-guts).<br \/>Methods: The patient-derived enteroids (PDEs) were grown from duodenal tissue of non-oncologic patients, embedded in Matrigel, and cultured in media impregnated with essential growth factors. These PDEs have the capacity to recapitulate the full array of intestinal cells that are present in the crypt-villus axis. We first treated PDEs with FG-4592 then irradiation at 24 hours followed by RT-qPCR at 72 hrs post-exposure to gauge the effects of radiation on markers associated with intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and differentiated epithelial cells. Single cell RNA seq techniques were used to identify shifts in cellular populations FG-4592 and\/or radiation treatment of human enteroids.<br \/>Results: Irradiation produced a signature of enhanced Crypt Base Columnar (CBC) cells and +4 quiescent stem cells markers (Bmi1, Tert, Dclk1) suggesting these specialized cells awaken upon crypt damage and start to proliferate to restore the ISC pool. The +4 cell markers are further enhanced in FG-4592 treated irradiated group, suggesting EGLN inhibition leads to activation of these specialized cell population along with restoration of other intestinal cells like secretory progenitors and Paneth cells. Further, gene set enrichment analysis after FG-4592 treatment showed the activation of key pathways involved in proliferation, maintaining homeostasis, metabolism, and DNA repair that could lead to intestinal proliferation and recovery from radiation damage.<br \/>Conclusion: Taken together, these preliminary data suggest that HIF stabilization by FG-4592 upregulates the normally quiescent +4 stem cells, a radioresistant stem population historically thought to become active upon radiation injury, along with activation of several other pathways required for normal proliferation and recovery from radiation injury. Our study justifies further exploration in clinical trials as a radioprotective or radio mitigative agent.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-02 Interventional radiology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: pancreatic,Hypoxia-inducible factor,Radiosensitivity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Neeraj Kumari<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Maya Ferrell<sup><\/sup>, Carolina  G.

Unfortunately, prolonged exposure to radiation has adverse effects on tissues of the oral cavity, including a decrease in the hardness of dentin. Consequently, patients who receive radiation therapy are susceptible to tooth sensitivity and caries. Fluoride treatments have proven to be effective in restoring the hardness of dentin as it remineralizes the tooth. The aim of this study was to determine the optimal fluoride treatment for restoring the hardness of irradiated teeth.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>100 teeth were extracted, cleaned, and mounted in acrylic resin. The teeth were ground and polished to expose the dentin and enamel.

All groups were subjected to 2 grays of daily radiation treatment for 6 weeks. The hardness of the dentin was measured immediately following radiation.

Over 800,000 new cancer cases require potentially curative or palliative RT services in Africa, arguably less than 15% of these patients currently have access to this important service. For a population of over 200 million, Nigeria requires a minimum of 280 RT machines for the increasing number of cancer cases. Painfully the country has only 8 government-funded radiotherapy machines. This study aimed to evaluate the status of the eight (8) Government-funded RT centres in Nigeria regarding RT equipment, workforce and infrastructure to quantify their ability to deliver effective RT to their patients.<br \/><b>METHODS: <\/b><b><\/b>A survey addressing ten (10) critical areas was used to assess the eight (8) Government-funded RT centres in Nigeria.<br \/><b>RESULTS: <\/b>Unfortunately, 6 of the 8 centres (75%) surveyed have not treated patients with RT over the last 2 years because they do not have functioning teletherapy machines. Only 2 RT centres have the capability of treating patients using advanced RT techniques. There is no PET-CT scan in any of the Government-funded RTcentres. The workforce capacity and infrastructure across the 8 centres are limited. All of the centres lack residency training programmes for medical physicists and radiation therapy technologists (RTTs) resulting in very few well-trained staff.<br \/><b>CONCLUSION: <\/b><b><\/b>As the Nigeria government plans for the new National Cancer Control Plan, there is an urgent need to scale up access to radiotherapy by upgrading the RT equipment, workforce and infrastructure to meet the current needs of Nigerian cancer patients. While the shortfall is apparent from a variety of radiotherapy-capacity data bases, this detailed analysis provides essential information for an implementation plan involving solutions from within Nigeria and with global partners.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL10-07 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radiotherapy,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Simeon C.
