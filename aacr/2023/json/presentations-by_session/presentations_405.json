[{"Abstract":"Approximately 15% of all tumors harbor deletions in the 9p21 locus that encompass <i>CDKN2A<\/i> and <i>MTAP<\/i>. MTAP fuels the adenine and methionine salvage pathways by converting MTA into precursors of building blocks for protein and DNA production. In <i>MTAP<\/i>-deleted (<i>MTAP<\/i><sup>del<\/sup>) tumors, cellular MTA accumulates and partially inhibits the essential protein methyl transferase, PRMT5, through direct displacement of the cofactor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) from the PRMT5 active site. This context provides therapeutic opportunities, currently under clinical evaluation, to selectively extinguish PRMT5 activity in tumor cells with MAT2A inhibitors that limit SAM synthesis or with direct PRMT5 inhibitors that are MTA-cooperative. Preclinical modeling of these synthetic lethal relationships, and elucidation of their cellular mechanisms of action, suggests efficacy can vary depending upon the extent of MTA accumulation and\/or adaptive compensation to PRMT5 inhibition. To potentially maximize therapeutic activity among mechanistically heterogenous <i>MTAP<\/i><sup>del<\/sup> tumors, we evaluated combinatorial pathway suppression with MAT2A and PRMT5 inhibitors in <i>MTAP<\/i><sup>WT<\/sup> and <i>MTAP<\/i><sup>del<\/sup> tumor models in vitro and in vivo. We noted synergistic antiproliferative effects when the potent and selective MAT2A inhibitor IDE397 was combined with any of multiple MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors in <i>MTAP<\/i><sup>del<\/sup> cell lines that exhibit sensitivity to each single agent. In vivo, the combination of IDE397 and MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors were well tolerated, and induced durable tumor regressions, including complete responses, at dose levels well below the maximally efficacious preclinical dose of each individual agent in <i>MTAP<\/i><sup>del<\/sup> lung adenocarcinoma and pancreas cancer models H838 and BXPC3. Pharmacodynamic target engagement in the tumor was evaluated by quantitative assessment of symmetric dimethyl arginine (SDMA), as detected by IHC, and indicated earlier onset and greater extent of PRMT5 inhibition by combination treatment as compared to either agent alone. The potentiation of the antitumor response with the combination did not occur in the MTAP<sup>WT<\/sup> setting. Thus, combined inhibition of MAT2A and PRMT5 potentially offers a compelling dual synthetic lethal opportunity to address unmet need for the many patients afflicted with <i>MTAP<\/i><sup>del<\/sup> cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Methylation,Synthetic lethality,Predictive biomarkers,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Marcus M.

Abnormally activated AURKA promotes tumorigenesis through enhancing cancer cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and cancer stem cell self-renewal, rendering it an attractive therapeutic target. We have developed JAB-2485, a highly selective small-molecule AURKA inhibitor.<br \/>Methods: Biochemical and cell-based assays were performed to determine the IC<sub>50<\/sub> of JAB-2485 on Aurora kinase family members. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and caspase 3\/7 assay were performed to detect JAB-2485-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, respectively. The CellTiter-Glo assay was performed to evaluate the effect of JAB-2485 in multiple cancer cell lines. Finally, the antitumor effect of JAB-2485 either as a single agent or in combinations was investigated in tumor cell line-derived xenografts.<br \/>Results: JAB-2485 is potent and highly selective on AURKA, with IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 0.33nM and around 1700-fold selectivity over AURKB. Following treatment of JAB-2485, the level of AURKA phosphorylation as a pharmacodynamic marker was significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner. As a single agent, JAB-2485 inhibited <i>in vitro<\/i> proliferation of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and neuroblastoma cell lines along with induced G2\/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and significantly inhibited <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor growth on SCLC and neuroblastoma xenografts. Furthermore, JAB-2485 showed strong synergy with cisplatin and paclitaxel in SCLC and TNBC animal models, respectively.<br \/>Conclusions: Taken together, preclinical results provide robust evidence supporting further evaluation of JAB-2485 both as a single agent and in combinations for treatment of various types of cancers.

These functions are mediated by the TEAD family of transcription factors which, when bound to the co-activators YAP or TAZ, induce expression of pro-growth and anti-apoptotic genes. This pathway is frequently dysregulated across tumor types, with genetic alterations along with other mechanisms driving hyper-active YAP\/TAZ-TEAD. In addition, Hippo signaling mediates resistance to therapies targeting key oncogenic pathways such as EGFR and RAS. As a result, TEAD transcription factors are promising therapeutic targets. The TEAD family comprises four paralogs (TEAD1-4) that have both over-lapping and non-redundant functions. Given the essential roles of the Hippo pathway in normal physiology, it may be beneficial to target a subset of TEADs to minimize potential on-target toxicity while maintaining anti-tumor efficacy.<br \/>Although highly homologous, the lipid-binding pocket of TEADs harbor some sequence divergence, highlighting an opportunity to design paralog-specific compounds. We developed IK-930 as a novel, selective inhibitor that potently blocks TEAD transcriptional activity by disrupting the auto-palmitoylation required for its interaction with YAP\/TAZ. To demonstrate the selectivity profile of IK-930, a suite of biochemical assays was employed, all of which showed preferential compound binding to an individual paralog. A novel NanoBRET<sup>TM<\/sup> system that enabled quantitative, high-throughput measurements of cellular TEAD engagement also documented selective inhibitor interaction with the same family member.<br \/>To assess how differences in selectivity affect therapeutic index, the in vivo efficacy and toxicity of IK-930 was compared to a pan-TEAD inhibitor. In several Hippo-mutated xenograft models, both compounds displayed potent anti-tumor activity. Moreover, IK-930 exhibited synergy with targeted agents, including EGFR inhibitors, indicating that its selectivity profile could drive robust efficacy in diverse tumor types. Previous studies in genetically engineered mouse models reported that perturbation of YAP\/TAZ results in kidney toxicity. Treatment with a pan-TEAD inhibitor in rats and non-human primates led to substantial proteinuria and kidney pathology at exposures similar to those needed for antitumor activity in mouse models. In contrast, IK-930 demonstrated limited kidney toxicity in rats above efficacious doses and no signs of renal problems in non-human primates. Collectively, these results suggest that paralog selectivity with IK-930 broadens the therapeutic window of this novel compound class. With its distinct TEAD inhibitory profile, IK-930 offers unique therapeutic index advantages, further supporting its development as a first-in-class paralog-selective TEAD inhibitor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,Hippo pathway,Therapeutic Index,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nathan Young<\/b><sup><\/sup>, George Punkosdy<sup><\/sup>, Jill Cavanaugh<sup><\/sup>, Collin Bantle<sup><\/sup>, Alex Constan<sup><\/sup>, Bin Li<sup><\/sup>, James Conley<sup><\/sup>, Marta Sanchez-Martin<sup><\/sup>, Lan Xu<sup><\/sup>, Karen McGovern<sup><\/sup>, Alfredo Castro<sup><\/sup>, Michelle Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Jeffrey Ecsedy<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Ikena Oncology, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6f8048d9-e41a-4cf0-8629-3aaae79af1e1","ControlNumber":"7107","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

The existing treatment (chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ)+radiotherapy) increases the median survival by 2-3 months. One protein, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is expressed in 57.4% of GBM and half of them expresses its aggressive mutant, EGFRvIII, whose expression is associated with resistance to apoptosis, activation of DNA repair and ultimately resistance to chemotherapy. In the context of a strategy termed &#8220;combi-targeting&#8221;, we developed molecules designed to block EGFRvIII while being capable of inducing DNA damage. <i>In vivo<\/i> analysis suggests that the first prototype of such a class ZR2002 loses its DNA damaging function through metabolic oxidation. Recently, we surmised that a molecule designed to be metabolically stable may require a lower dose to be active in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we measured the cytotoxicity of the new combi-molecule, called \"AF143\", in a panel of glioblastoma cell lines and then we determined its efficacy and drug metabolism in an <i>in vivo<\/i> model of glioblastoma derived from human glioblastoma stem cells (GSC) with known resistance to TMZ.<br \/><i>Material and Methods<\/i>. Three glioblastoma cells line (U87-wt, U87-EGFR and U87-EGFRvIII) and the human GSC (1123IC7R) were used to determine IC50 of AF143 and ZR2002 with SRB or alamarBlue assay. Xenograft of tumors were obtained by intracranial injection of 1123IC7R-Luc GSC into the head of NSG female mice. One group of mice was treated with ZR2002 (N=8), the other with AF143 (N=7), the last with vehicle (N=8). Mice received 10 total doses: 2 cycles of 1 dose (100mg\/kg) daily for 5 consecutive days followed by 2 days off, by oral gavage. The tumour burden was measured by bioluminescent imaging and drug metabolism by LC-MS. Body weights, mortality and toxicity were monitored. Survival curves and statistical analysis calculated.<br \/><i>Results<\/i>. <i>In vitro<\/i> growth inhibitory analysis showed that AF143 was 2-fold more potent than ZR2002 in U87-EGFR and 1123IC7R GSC and 3-fold more potent in U87-EGFRvIII. <i>In vivo<\/i> analysis of AF143 given alone showed significant antitumor activity (p&#60;0.05) after 5 doses treatment, while ZR2002 induced an apparent tumour delay (p&#62;0.05). Remarkably, AF143 and ZR2002 treatment significantly prolonged the overall survival of mice compared with the control group (p= 0.0004 for AF143 and p=0.04 for ZR2002). Analysis of drug metabolism revealed that in contrast to ZR2002, AF143 remained intact after 2h treatment, with moderate levels of N-acetyl and N6-dealkylated metabolites.<i> <\/i><br \/><i>Conclusion<\/i>. The results <i>in toto<\/i> suggest that the intact structure of AF143 is stable to metabolism, can cross the blood brain barrier and induce antitumour activity in a EGFRvIII expressing glioblastoma stem cell model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Small molecule inhibitor,Drug resistance,Chemotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Caterina Facchin<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Ana Belen Fraga Timiraos<sup><\/sup>, Brian Meehan<sup><\/sup>, Nadia Babaa<sup><\/sup>, Lata Adnani<sup><\/sup>, Anne-Laure Larroque<sup><\/sup>, Janusz Rak<sup><\/sup>, Bertrand J Jean-Claude<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Research Institute at McGill University Health Centre (RI-MUHC), Montréal, QC, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3e5e5b87-6363-4476-bb74-3b4396fce6da","ControlNumber":"6748","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

A shared adverse event that contributes to a narrow therapeutic index and limits combination potential is hematologic toxicity. First generation PARP inhibitors are not selective against PARP2, which has been shown to play a role in the survival of hematopoietic progenitor cells in animal models. However genetic studies suggest that the synthetic lethality from PARP trapping with HRD is primarily dependent on PARP1. We hypothesized that a potent and selective PARP1 inhibitor and trapper would achieve equivalent anti-tumor activity as non-selective PARP inhibitors while alleviating toxicities caused by PARP2 inhibition.<br \/>SNV-001 is a novel, proprietary, potent, and selective PARP1 inhibitor and trapper. In PARylation assays, SNV-001 inhibited PARP1 activity with low nanomolar potency and displayed greater than 500-fold selectivity against PARP2. In cellular PARP trapping assays, SNV-001 potently trapped PARP1 on DNA in a dose-dependent manner but did not trap PARP2 up to 25 &#181;M. Functionally, SNV-001 exhibited selective growth inhibitory activity against cancer cell lines with impaired HR function. In anti-proliferation and colony formation assays of BRCA-mutant cell lines including MDA-MB-436 (BRCA1 deficient) and DLD1 (BRCA2 knockout), SNV-001 inhibited cell growth and colony formation with single-digit nM IC<sub>50<\/sub> values while having minimal effects against BRCA-WT cells. In a subcutaneous MDA-MB-436 xenograft tumor model, SNV-001 administered orally once daily achieved dose-dependent inhibition of PARylation <i>in vivo.<\/i> Furthermore, SNV-001 showed dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition using low daily doses with greater efficacy compared to olaparib dosed at 100 mg\/kg once daily. In the cohort receiving a higher dose of SNV-001, all animals showed complete regression after 35 days of treatment without any clinical signs of toxicity.<br \/>In summary, we have discovered SNV-001, a potent and selective PARP1 inhibitor and trapper that shows excellent activity against cancer models with HRD <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>.

CHAMPs are heterobifunctional small molecules that mediate protein degradation by inducing proximity between a target protein and the HSP90 chaperone complex, resulting in target ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Due HSP90 being highly activated in cancer cells, CHAMPs also preferentially accumulate in tumors relative to normal tissues, resulting in an improved therapeutic index relative to typical inhibitors. In order to chemically induce KRAS(G12C) degradation, CHAMP compounds were synthesized by covalently coupling KRAS(G12C)- and HSP90-binding moieties through a short linker. CHAMP treatment of KRAS(G12C)-mutated cell lines resulted in formation of a KRAS(G12C)-CHAMP-HSP90 ternary complex and subsequent proteasome-dependent KRAS(G12C) degradation and inhibition of cell proliferation. In contrast, combination treatment with KRAS(G12C) and HSP90 inhibitors did not result in substantial KRAS(G12C) degradation. Importantly, CHAMPs retained potency in cell line models of resistance to covalent KRAS(G12C) inhibitors. Further, in mouse xenograft models, CHAMPs displayed prolonged pharmacokinetics in tumors relative to plasma and normal tissues and strongly inhibited tumor growth at tolerated doses. Based on these findings, KRAS(G12C)-degrading CHAMPs represents a promising approach to the treatment of KRAS(G12C)-mutated cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Hsp90,Drug resistance,Drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kevin P.

It has shown its efficacy in various tumors, including lung, breast, colon, and ovarian cancer cell and xenograft models, both in a p53-dependent and -independent manner. In ovarian cancer cell lines with the TP53 mutation, p21 expression was found to be upregulated without the involvement of p53. Additionally, it was proposed that Kevetrin caused the histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) enzyme to be downregulated, negatively affecting the HDAC6-Hsp90 chaperone axis and causing the degradation of p53 in the mutant mice. In the present study, we designed and synthesized a novel analog (compound 900) of Kevetrin and its cytotoxicity was assessed using four different ovarian cancer cell lines viz. OVCAR-3, OVCAR-10, ES2, drug-resistant HeyA8 cells, and normal fibroblast cells (FHC). Compared to the control and Kevetrin, compound 900 inhibited the ovarian cancer cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The IC<sub>50 <\/sub>value of compound 900 was 0.8 &#956;M, 0.7 &#956;M, 0.8 &#956;M, and 0.9 &#956;M for OVCAR-3, HeyA8, OVCAR-10, and ES2 cells, respectively, while for Kevetrin the IC<sub>50<\/sub> value was &#62;100 &#956;M for 48 h treatment. Compound 900 was thus found to be &#62;100 times more potent than standard Kevetrin. To further acquaint the effect of 48 h treatment on cell proliferation, we performed trypan blue cell viability assay, trypan blue dye exclusion assay, Annexin V\/7-AAD, Caspase 3\/7 apoptosis assays, and Western blotting of apoptotic proteins involved in apoptosis. Compound 900 significantly induced apoptosis in OVCAR-3 and HeyA8 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Upregulation of several apoptotic proteins, as evident by Western blot, suggested that 900 causes the induction of apoptotic pathways efficiently. Further, the cell cycle analysis showed a significant arrest of OVCAR-3 and HeyA8 cells in the S-phase, which was further confirmed by the analysis of cyclin A2, cyclin-E1, p21, and p27 protein expression. Additionally, compound 900 caused a significant increase in the expression of the cell cycle inhibitory genes p21 and p27 in a p53-independent manner, compared to Kevetrin. Kevetrin has shown promise in preliminary clinical studies in solid tumor patients. The new analog 900 is &#62;100 fold more potent than Kevetrin and holds great promise to be developed further for ovarian and other mechanistically relevant cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Novel anticancer agents,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Asif Raza<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jacek Krzeminski<sup><\/sup>, Shantu Amin<sup><\/sup>, Arun Sharma<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Penn State Health Milton S.

Oridonin is a natural diterpene compound enriched in medicinal herb <i>Rabdosia rubescens<\/i>, and its unique anti-cancer properties have been extensively studied. However, clinical applications of oridonin are limited due to its relatively low potency. Previously, we developed a class of druglike nitrogen-enriched oridonin derivatives, including CYD0618 and others, with thiazole modifications as effective anticancer agents to inhibit breast cancer growth <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Although breast cancer screening and treatments have improved over the last half-century, aggressive subtypes like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are refractory to frontline therapies, in which the STAT3 transcription factor plays a key role in developing therapeutic resistance and recurrence. Currently, there are no FDA-approved direct STAT3 inhibitors in clinical use. We reported that CYD0618 inhibits STAT3 signaling, likely through a direct interaction with STAT3. With proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology, our team designed novel oridonin- and CYD0618-based PROTAC compounds including PW0965 and PW1087 in an attempt to achieve STAT3 binding and degradation. We determined anticancer effects of PW0965 and PW1087 on proliferation, colony formation, apoptosis and cell motility of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells MDA-MB-231 and BT549. We found that both compounds significantly inhibited the proliferation of TNBC cells. Compared with oridonin, both compounds more effectively induced apoptosis of TNBC cells. Additionally, MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells treated with these PROTACs showed significantly reduced migration and invasion compared to control cells. PW0965 and PW1087 treatment reduced protein levels of STAT3 and its activation at Y705 residue in TNBC cells as early as 4 hours of treatment. This observed reduction in STAT3 protein on Western blot exhibited dose and time dependence. Collectively,<b> <\/b>our results demonstrate that oridonin and its analog-based PROTACs exhibit excellent potency against TNBC cells, likely through protein degradation of STAT3. The potency of PW0965 and PW1087 warrants further <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> investigation in cancer cells and tumor xenograft models. The molecular profiles of these PROTACs, including their interactions with STAT proteins and protein degradation, are currently under investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,oridonin derivatives,PROTAC,STAT3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ruixia Ma<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jun Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Gabrielle  R.

Its correct function is essential for cellular homeostasis, however normal XPO1 function is often disrupted in malignant cells. XPO1 is overexpressed in solid and hematological tumors and higher XPO1 expression is often associated with poorer prognosis. XPO1-regulated cargo proteins include tumor suppressor proteins and cell cycle regulators that can be involved in tumorigenesis. For example, aberrant XPO1 function may lead to cytoplasmic mislocalization of tumor suppressor proteins which results in their functional inactivation and hence may cause tumorigenesis. Inhibition of XPO1 function will restore their proper subcellular localization and function and cause tumor regression. Although XPO1 has a central role in cellular homeostasis, it is a good target for cancer therapy, as illustrated by the clinical success of the selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) selinexor. Selinexor is the first and currently the only XPO1 inhibitor clinically approved. It is applied for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma after at least one prior treatment, and for the treatment of diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Selinexor covalently binds to XPO1. The second generation SINE eltanexor is also a covalent XPO1 inhibitor but has only minimal brain penetration and consequently lower toxicity in preclinical studies. Here, we describe a novel chemical class of reversible XPO1 inhibitors with high brain penetration but with good tolerability allowing frequent dosing in preclinical models. The lead compound, FR-027, potently inhibits XPO1 function (EC50 69 &#177; 10 nM) and shows potent cancer cell growth inhibition <i>in vitro<\/i> of both hematological and solid cancer cell lines (EC50 50-950 nM). FR-027 is a reversible inhibitor of XPO1 and unlike many other XPO1 inhibitors it does not induce XPO1 protein degradation; this may contribute to an increased tolerability. Indeed, while it shows high brain penetration, FR-027 allows frequent dosing in mice with good tolerability (body weight). It is orally bioavailable and demonstrates strong anti-leukemic efficacy in an aggressive MOLT-4 xenograft model. Importantly, it shows potent efficacy in both an orthotopic U87 MG brain tumor xenograft model and a metastatic syngeneic ID8-fLuc ovarian cancer model with significant survival benefit as monotherapy. Altogether, these results demonstrate that FR-027 is a novel, reversible XPO1 inhibitor with important molecular and pharmacological characteristics that warrant further clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Small molecule inhibitor,Nuclear-cytoplasmic transport,Glioblastoma,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Janne Van Hauwenhuyse<sup>1<\/sup>, Felien Reniers<sup>2<\/sup>, Leentje Persoons<sup>1<\/sup>, Sam Noppen<sup>1<\/sup>, Eline Boel<sup>3<\/sup>, Els Vanstreels<sup>1<\/sup>, Ann Vankerckhoven<sup>4<\/sup>, Bert Kwanten<sup>1<\/sup>, An Coosemans<sup>4<\/sup>, Guy Van den Mooter<sup>3<\/sup>, Wim Dehaen<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Dirk Daelemans<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Chemistry, Molecular Design and Synthesis, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Oncology, Laboratory for Tumor Immunology and Immunotherapy, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2fe8a1f4-65fb-4f32-8ed6-57701cd075a9","ControlNumber":"7126","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

KRAS mutations and LKB1 inactivation commonly occur in NSCLC and are associated with poor prognosis. Several studies enunciate the role of the immune system in lung cancer progression through cancer cells' ability to escape immune surveillance. Therefore, understanding NSCLC progression requires the examination of the molecular mechanisms behind this process. The importance of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and mitochondrial metabolism in lung cancer has been continuously emphasized; OXPHOS and mitochondrial biogenesis markers predict low survival in NSCLC patients. Additionally, heme is an essential molecule in the OXPHOS pathway, and previous studies have shown that heme sequestration using heme sequestering protein 2 (HeSP2) arrests tumor progression. HeSP2 can potentially normalize the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) via multiple mechanisms including the normalization of vessels which may promote immune cell infiltration, the reduction of hypoxia which may promote antitumor immune function, and the reduction of heme levels which potentially decreases the production of immunosuppressive enzymes requiring heme as a cofactor. In this study, control and HeSP2-treated tumors generated from a genetically engineered mouse model LSL-Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> LKB1<sup>-\/-<\/sup> (LSL-KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>; LKB<sup>loxP\/loxP<\/sup>; LSL-Luciferase (KL<sub>Luc<\/sub>) infected with AdenoCre virus and sacrificed at 10 months were used for immunohistochemical analysis. We examined immune markers under HeSP2 treatment to determine the immune system response to heme targeting and its effects on tumor progression. Results demonstrated that HeSP2 can modulate the tumor immune microenvironment increasing the levels of immune markers, which suggests that heme targeting can potentiate immunotherapy efficacy in lung cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Immune response,Mitochondria,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maria del Carmen Chacon Castro<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Eranda Berisha<sup><\/sup>, Narges Salamat<sup><\/sup>, Li Zhang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Biological Sciences, UT Dallas, Richardson, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"26fa7916-1fe4-4c53-8006-66c59218bd6d","ControlNumber":"6812","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Due to the inactivation of PP2A in cancer, many of the cellular processes that PP2A regulates are aimed towards tumor progression. As such, the therapeutic targeting of PP2A in cancer is becoming a popular research avenue in the development of new chemotherapeutics. Currently, there have been a few PP2A activators observed to inhibit tumor progression <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i>; however, these compounds have shown to have poor bioavailability, such as NSC49L, or uncertainty towards their ability to activate PP2A, as is the case with iHAP1. These hindrances demonstrate a need for further optimization of these molecules in order to produce a PP2A activator capable of inhibiting cancer without these limitations. As such, we have designed a series of compounds utilizing molecular modeling and fragment-based drug design based upon the known PP2A activators, NSC49L and iHAP1. These compounds were assessed for their ability to inhibit colon cancer (CRC) cells and FOLFOX-resistant CRC cells, where PPA24 was identified as the lead compound. The dose-response curves identified IC<sub>50<\/sub> values in the range of 2.36-6.75&#181;M for PPA24 across four CRC cell lines (HCT116, HT29, DLD1, and SW480) and two FOLFOX-resistant CRC cell lines (FOLFOX-HCT116 and FOLFOX-HT29), displaying more cytotoxicity than both the parent compounds and the other compounds in the series. Molecular docking recognized lower binding energies occurring during the association of PP2A with PPA24 than with either NSC49L or iHAP1. When examining the <i>in vitro<\/i> effect of PPA24 on stimulating PP2A activation, it was found that PPA24 significantly induced PP2A activity 2-3-fold higher than NSC49L or iHAP1. Likewise, PPA24 was able to induce apoptosis dose-dependently in both CRC and FOLFOX-resistant CRC cells. As PP2A is known for regulating the cell cycle progression, further exploration revealed PPA24 able to induce cell cycle arrest at the G2\/M phase. And PP2A, being known as a regulator for many cellular processes, can be activated to assist in the degradation and inactivation of many signaling proteins such as c-myc, GSK3&#946;, and ERK, which was observed in CRC cells treated with PPA24. Together, these results signify the potential of PPA24 to act as a novel PP2A activator in the treatment of CRC and FOLFOX-resistant CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colon cancer,Protein phosphatase,Drug discovery,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hannah Johnson<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Amandeep Singh<sup>1<\/sup>, Asif Raza<sup>1<\/sup>, Congzhou  M.

Elevated expression of the enzyme methionine aminopeptidase type 2 (MetAP2) in prostate cancer was recently shown to be associated with higher grade tumors and with worse clinical outcomes (Xie, 2021). Evexomostat\/SDX-7320 is a polymer-drug conjugate of a novel fumagillin-derived MetAP2 inhibitor attached to a polymer backbone via a cleavable linker. This design alters biodistribution (limits CNS penetration) and improves pharmacokinetics relative to small molecule fumagillin-derived MetAP2 inhibitors. Evexomostat completed a phase I safety study in late-stage cancer patients and is in two phase 2 breast cancer studies (NCT05455619, NCT05570253).<br \/>Methods: To evaluate the efficacy of evexomostat in a model of prostate cancer, NSG mice were injected subcutaneously with 2&#215;10<sup>6<\/sup> LNCaP cells. When tumors reached &#8776;200 mm<sup>3<\/sup>, mice were randomized into 4 groups. A cohort of intact mice (Group 1; n=4\/group) received treatment with SDX-7320 (12 mg\/kg, s.c. Q4D) or vehicle (5% mannitol\/water). Group 2 were castrated and randomized to SDX-7320 (6 mg\/kg, 12 mg\/kg) or Vehicle (5% mannitol) upon recovery (n=4\/group). Group 3 (n=13\/group) and Group 4 (n=14\/group) were castrated and randomized to Vehicle or SDX-7320 at recurrence of tumor growth with Group 4 additionally receiving enzalutamide (10 mg\/kg, p.o., QD). Tumor growth and body weight were assessed twice\/week. Upon necropsy, tumors were dissected, weighed and snap frozen for RNAseq analysis or formalin fixed along with major organs for histological processing (H&#38;E staining, and tumor CD31, CD34 IHC analysis).<br \/>Results: Evexomostat elicited a significant reduction in tumor growth in the absence of significant changes in body weight. Survival in evexomostat-treated mice was doubled relative to vehicle-treated mice (12.5 vs 23.5 days). In castrated mice (Group 2), evexomostat (6 and 12 mg\/kg) attenuated tumor growth with no change in body weight, and in CRPC mice (Group 3), evexomostat also significantly inhibited tumor growth. Treatment of CRPC mice (Group 4) with enzalutamide alone elicited a mixed response, with 6\/14 mice showing sustained response to enzalutamide (responders). At endpoint, tumors from enzalutamide non-responders averaged 0.54g (&#177; 0.09g) and enzalutamide responders 0.27g (&#177; 0.07g), p&#38;lt0.05, while tumors from SDX-7320 plus enzalutamide-treated mice weighed 0.19g (&#177; 0.07g), p&#38;lt0.005 compared to enzalutamide non-responders.<br \/>Conclusions: MetAP2 inhibition has potential as a new approach for the treatment of prostate cancer. The clinical-stage MetAP2 inhibitor evexomostat\/SDX-7320 significantly inhibited the growth of LNCaP tumors in intact, castrated and CRPC mice. Clinical evaluation of evexomostat in castration-sensitive as well as castration-resistant prostate cancer patients is warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Androgen independence,Androgen receptor,Cancer progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Peter Cornelius<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Benjamin Mayes<sup>2<\/sup>, Bradley  J.

TYMS catalyzes the de novo synthesis reaction of deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP), one of the building blocks of DNA.

Here we report a small molecule TYMS inhibitor and its two analogues that exhibit i) enhanced anti-tumor activity as compared to current fluoropyrimidines and antifolates without inducing TYMS overexpression, ii) are structurally distinct from classical antifolates, iii) extend survival in both pancreatic xenograft tumor models and <i>hTS\/Ink4a\/Arf<\/i> null genetically engineered mouse tumor model, iv) and are well tolerated with equal efficacy using either intraperitoneal or oral administration. Mechanistically, we confirm the compound and its analogues are a multifunctional non-classical antifolate, and we identify structural features allowing direct TYMS inhibition while also maintaining the ability to inhibit dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Collectively, this work identifies new non-classical antifolate inhibitors that optimize inhibition of thymidylate biosynthesis with a favorable safety profile highlighting potential for enhanced cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Thymidylate synthase,Cancer,Drug discovery,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maria Guijarro<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Peter Elias Dib<sup>1<\/sup>, Patrick Kellish<sup>1<\/sup>, Nick Paciaroni<sup>2<\/sup>, Akbar Nawab<sup>1<\/sup>, Jacob Andring<sup>1<\/sup>, Lidia Kulemina<sup>1<\/sup>, Derek Leas<sup>2<\/sup>, Nick Borrero<sup>2<\/sup>, Carlos Modenutti<sup>3<\/sup>, Richard Bennett<sup>1<\/sup>, Jonathan Licht<sup>1<\/sup>, Robert McKenna<sup>1<\/sup>, Adrian Roitberg<sup>4<\/sup>, Frederic Kaye<sup>1<\/sup>, Maria Zajac-Kaye<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Florida College of Pharmacy, Gainesville, FL,<sup>3<\/sup>Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina,<sup>4<\/sup>University of Florida, Gainesville, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ff64688c-a70c-48d4-8ac9-a419eac52999","ControlNumber":"6383","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Current molecular targeted therapeutics, and several in development, inhibit only specific mutant alleles (G12C, G12D). In addition, compounds which directly inhibit RAS via proteolytic degradation or inhibit RAS activation by SOS1 are in preclinical development and are referred to as Pan-KRAS inhibitors. Previously investigators have reported that the NSAID, sulindac, can selectively inhibit RAS mutant tumorigenesis by a cyclooxygenase (COX)-independent mechanism. Sulindac, and more potent analogs have also previously been reported to inhibit RAS-mediated transformation and directly bind RAS. Here we describe an ultra-potent non-COX inhibitory derivative of sulindac, ADT-007, which binds to and inhibits RAS nucleotide binding and RAS-effector association.<br \/>ADT-007 binding to KRAS was evaluated by Micro-Tag cell target engagement and by Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) which demonstrated a potency of target engagement (EC<sub>50<\/sub>) value in the subnanomolar range. Consistent with molecular docking studies, HSQC NMR spectroscopy using recombinant KRAS revealed that ADT-007 interacted with KRAS after Mg<sup>2+<\/sup> chelation to obtain a nucleotide free (NF) state, resulting in chemical shift changes and signal attenuation of residues in the P-loop and nucleotide binding domain. Similarly, biochemical assays confirmed that ADT-007 prevented MANT-GTP binding to recombinant NF KRAS but did not compete with bound GTP. Functional assays also showed that KRAS binding to RAF-RBD(GST) was inhibited by ADT-007. The compound inhibited constitutive RAS activation (RAF-RBD pulldown) in serum starved MiaPaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells harboring a KRAS-G12C mutation and demonstrated Pan-RAS inhibition in serum- or EGF-stimulated cells. Further, ADT-007 inhibited AKT phosphorylation and EGF-stimulated downstream ERK1\/2 phosphorylation. Finally, ADT-007 demonstrated RAS-selective growth inhibition in isogenic pancreatic and colorectal cancer cell pairs (BxPC-3, HT29). Together, these experiments support further development of ADT-007 and related analogs for treatment of RAS-driven cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ras,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Adam B.

Although breast cancer screening and treatments have improved significantly over the last half-century, aggressive subtypes like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) as well as growing chemoresistance cases continue to evade frontline therapies. STAT3, a transcription factor involved in cell proliferation, survival, and malignant transformation, plays a key role in mammary carcinogenesis, resistance, and recurrence. Both STAT3 overexpression and aberrant activation are frequently observed in primary breast tumors and their metastatic lesions. Although STAT3 is recognized as an attractive preventive and therapeutic target, there are no FDA-approved STAT3 inhibitors in clinical use. Via structure- and fragment-based drug design strategies as well as <i>in silico<\/i> molecular modeling and docking, our team previously developed a putative STAT3 inhibitor, HJC0152. This study aims to further characterize the anticancer mechanism of HJC0152 as well as optimize its potency. Our results show that HJC0152 interacts with STAT3 with a similar specificity to an experimental STAT3 inhibitor, Stattic. To further improve its potency and efficacy, we developed several HJC0152 derivatives including HJC0152-based proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) degraders. Several molecules showed comparable or improved potency to HJC0152 against several breast cancer cell lines including TNBC cells. While the total STAT3 protein level reduces moderately with HJC0152 treatment, several new compounds decrease STAT3 protein level more profoundly. In particular, the newly developed HJC0152-PROTACs showed a significant late inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation at the Tyr705 and Ser727 residues as well as a reduction in total STAT3 protein.

Despite the success of mutant-specific KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors, there is limited therapeutics for most KRAS-mutated patients (e.g., KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>, KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup> and KRAS<sup>G13D<\/sup>). Developing KRAS<sup>Multi<\/sup> inhibitor targeting a broad range of KRAS-driven cancers is another promising strategy.<br \/>Methods: The Induced Allosteric Drug Discovery Platform (IADDP) integrating medicinal chemistry, biophysical studies and computational techniques was applied for the development of JAB-23425. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) was applied to determine JAB-23425 binding affinity on KRAS. Guanine nucleotide exchange assays and effector interaction assays were applied to determine the functional inhibition of GDP- and GTP-bound KRAS in biochemical level. ERK phosphorylation assays and CellTiter-Glo assays in both KRAS-dependent and KRAS-independent cells were performed to evaluate the inhibitory activities of downstream signaling of KRAS and cell viability. <i>In vivo<\/i> PK-PD study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between drug concentration and the level of tumor ERK phosphorylation. Antitumor activity of JAB-23425 was evaluated in multiple mouse models of KRAS mutant cancer.<br \/>Results: Affinity measurement by SPR indicated strong binding of JAB-23425 to KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>, KRAS<sup>G12V<\/sup>, KRAS<sup>G13D<\/sup>, KRAS<sup>G12A<\/sup>, KRAS<sup>G12R<\/sup> and KRAS<sup>Q61H<\/sup> mutants as well as wild-type KRAS in both GDP- and GTP-bound states, with most K<sub>D<\/sub> in the sub-nanomolar range. Biochemical assays consistently demonstrated high potency of JAB-23425 on multiple KRAS mutants, and good selectivity over HRAS and NRAS. At the cellular level, JAB-23425 significantly reduced downstream ERK phosphorylation (most IC<sub>50 <\/sub>around 1 nM) and inhibited cell viability (most IC<sub>50<\/sub> lower than 10 nM) on KRAS-dependent tumor cells harboring various KRAS mutations and amplification, with good selectivity against normal cells and KRAS-independent tumor cells (e.g., NRAS<sup>mut<\/sup> and BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup>).

Recent pharmacological intervention has shown promising activities in preclinical models and early clinical trials. There are over 15 investigational agents targeting this pathway currently in the clinic, but none have been approved. In particular, small molecule TGF&#946; inhibitors targeting ALK5 (TGF&#946; type 1 receptor) have been limited by mechanism-based heart valve toxicity to low dose and intermittent dosing regimens. NEX002 is an oral liver-targeted ALK5 inhibitor with low heart exposure for the treatment of liver cancer and other gastrointestinal cancers with liver metastases. The compound was designed following drug design principles from known liver-specific drugs, such as the statins. In animals, NEX002 exerts preferential distribution (pharmacokinetic) and target inhibition (pharmacodynamic) in liver over the heart. NEX002 has demonstrated activity in several intrahepatic and subcutaneous tumor models, and significantly enhanced the durability of anti-tumor efficacy in combination with lenvatinib, a VEGFR inhibitor approved for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. No heart valve toxicity was observed when benchmarked against galunisertib (systemic ALK5 inhibitor) in toxicity studies with repeated daily dosing. These data suggest that our liver-targeted\/heart-sparing approach may allow more robust target engagement compared to systemic ALK5 inhibitors through higher dose or more frequent dosing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ALK,Liver,Targeted drug delivery,Gastrointestinal cancers: liver,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Andrew T.

In human, over 600 proteoforms are modified with the fatty acid myristate by two N-myristoyltransferases: NMT1 and NMT2. These include many proto-oncogenic proteins (e.g. Src-family kinases and c-Abl) and metabolic regulators (e.g. AMPK &#946; subunit). Thus, we validated the potential of NMTs as oncology targets on 300 cancer cell lines and uncovered its potential in hematological cancers. The multiple substrates of NMTs complicated the elucidation of a clear mechanism of action of the pan-NMT inhibitor PCLX-001. To circumvent this, we evaluated the individual roles of NMT1 and NMT2 in tumours as well as their relative contributions, including those of their substrates, to PCLX-001 sensitivity.<br \/>Analysis of TCGA and CCLE databases revealed that<i> NMT2<\/i> expression levels vary drastically (7 log2(TPM+1)) while those of <i>NMT1<\/i> vary slightly (3 log2(TPM+1)). Hematological cancers comprised the vast majority of the lowest <i>NMT2<\/i> expressing cells but lower <i>NMT2<\/i> levels were also observed in solid tumour cell lines (e.g. breast &#38; ovary). <i>NMT2<\/i> levels were also lower in cancer versus normal corresponding tissues. We confirmed that <i>NMT2<\/i> expression is epigenetically repressed at a CpG island found in the 5&#180;end of the <i>NMT2<\/i> gene thereby explaining the reduction in <i>NMT2<\/i> expression.<br \/>Since most hematological cancer cells are NMT2-deficient, we think that by targeting the remaining NMT1, PCLX-001 selectively kills these cells in a manner reminiscent of synthetic lethality, thereby sparing normal human cells with two NMTs. Therefore, identifying substrates specific to NMT1 in NMT2-deficient cancer cells became of the utmost importance to understand which NMT1 protein substrates were critical for survival. Using differential proteomics in the CRISPR\/Cas9 NMT1 KO HAP1 near-haploid cell line derived from the chronic myelogenous leukemia versus WT HAP1 cells, we<u> <\/u>surprisingly found that few signaling proteins were downregulated, rather, 36 mitochondrial protein levels were decreased and 18 of these belonged to respiratory complex I. Myristoylated mitochondrial protein NDUFAF4, a major complex I assembly factor, was the most downregulated and PCLX-001 reduced its levels leading to decreased complex I activity. This seemingly ordinary observation could have transformational implications for cancer treatment since oxidative phosphorylation is essential for both cancer stem cell survival and metastasis.<br \/>In addition, gene set enrichment analyses performed on RNASeq data obtained from 1200 cell lines treated with myristoylation inhibitors allowed us to derive an NMT inhibition sensitivity gene set that could be used to identify patients which would most benefit from NMT inhibition therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Synthetic lethality,Myristoylation,Haematological Cancers,Prognostic markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Erwan Beauchamp<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chistopher Cromwell<sup>2<\/sup>, Eman Moussa<sup>3<\/sup>, Aishwarya Iyer<sup>4<\/sup>, Megan Yap<sup>5<\/sup>, Rony Pain<sup>5<\/sup>, Jay Gamma<sup>5<\/sup>, Olivier Julien<sup>3<\/sup>, Basil Hubbard<sup>2<\/sup>, Luc Berthiaume<sup>5<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Pacylex Pharmaceuticals, Edmonton, AB, Canada,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Pharmacology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada,<sup>4<\/sup>University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Cell Biology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9ce4afe9-bc64-49ef-9f66-0962b5f31fca","ControlNumber":"7443","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;E.

However, the clinical utility of current MTAs, such as paclitaxel and vinblastine, are often limited due to adverse side effects or multidrug resistance (MDR) driving the continuous pursuit for the development of novel microtubule interactors. Here, we report the development of a novel non P-gp substrate MTA that is metabolically stable, and that displays broad-spectrum anti-cancer activity<i> in vitro<\/i> and <i>ex vivo<\/i>. Anti-cancer activity was assessed by screening a panel of 102 cancer cell lines and in a multi-tumor type panel of patient-derived organoids (PDOs). <i>In vitro<\/i>, double to triple digit nanomolar (ranging from 17nM to 318 nM) potency was observed in 101 cell lines, while viability was reduced by more than 70% in 76 cell lines out of 102. Similarly, 23 out of 34 (68%) of <i>ex vivo<\/i> treated PDOs were highly or partially responsive as indicated by a 37-73% decrease in viability. Studies using spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) inhibitors demonstrated a mechanism at or before microtubule-kinetochore attachment in M phase of the cell cycle. Subsequent microscopic evaluation of kinetochore assembly revealed a lack of proper mitotic spindle formation highlighted with an increase in Mad1 signal intensity emphasizing metaphase arrest. Furthermore, <i>in vitro<\/i> tubulin polymerization assays demonstrated that the anti-cancer effect is a result of cytoskeleton targeting to inhibit microtubule assembly. Additionally, the antimicrotubule agent inhibited the formation of EBI (N,N&#8217;-ethylene-bis(iodoacetamide)):&#946;-tubulin adducts indicating an occupied colchicine-binding site of tubulin. Six multi-tumor preclinical oncology models were evaluated for <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor efficacy by oral administration of the compound. Further, tumor growth inhibition (%) was demonstrated in preclinical murine models of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) (MV-4-11, 51%), colorectal (COLO205, 35%), prostate (DU 145, 38%), and gastric cancer (HS746T, 74%; SNU-5, 48%). Moreover, tumor tissue analysis for prominent mitotic cell cycle markers, Cyclin B1 and pHH3, revealed a dose-dependent elevation of both markers revealing mitotic arrest phenotype.

TACC3 is a key player in microtubule and centrosomal processes and is considered to have an important role in causing chromosomal instability leading to aggressive cancers. TACC3 also plays important role in DNA damage response mechanisms, hematopoiesis, epigenetics and immune functions by interacting with different protein partners. Inhibition of TACC3 by genomic approaches has shown significant reduction in growth of cancer cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Given its multiple roles in cancer, TACC3 is an ideal therapeutic target for highly aggressive cancers. Here, using phenotypic screening and rational drug design, we developed AO-252, a novel small molecule TACC3 protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitor. Binding assays and kinome screening suggested the specificity of AO-252 to TACC3. AO-252 targets the interactions of TACC3 with its known protein partners e.g., Clathrin\/KIFC1, BARD1 and MBD2\/HAT complexes regulating mitosis, DNA damage response and epigenetic functions. Gene expression profiling in multiple cell lines further confirmed the various TACC3 pathways affected by AO-252.

Surgical excision followed by concurrent temozolomide (TMZ), and radiation therapy are the current standard of care for GBM. Lomustine, another alkylating regimen, has also been approved for the treatment of patients with recurrent GBM in addition to TMZ. However, the primary GBM frequently recur as therapy-resistant relapses resulting in shorter survival of patients. To date, no systemic therapies have shown proven survival benefit in recurrent GBM. In this study, we examined whether FDA approved anti-depressant drug Imipramine serve as the potent option for treating patients with recurrent GBM and to improve efficacy of approved chemotherapy.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We investigated the anticancer effects of Imipramine using both established and patient-derived GBM cell lines. We tested the effect of Imipramine and Lomustine combination therapy using cell viability, colony formation, migration and apoptosis assays. Mechanistic studies were conducted using RNA-seq, western blotting, RT-PCR and reporter assays. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy of combination therapy was evaluated using orthotopic mouse models.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our results showed that antidepressant Imipramine blocked the growth of recurrent GBM. Furthermore, Imipramine enhanced the response of Lomustine in therapy resistant GBM cells as a combination therapy and significantly reduced the cell survival and migration, and increased the apoptosis in both established and patient derived GBM cells. Further, our results demonstrated that Imipramine inhibits growth of self-renewing cancer stem cells, which contribute to drug resistance and relapse of GBM. Mechanistic studies revealed that the Imipramine treatment abrogated the WNT-&#946;-catenin signaling, which was confirmed by TOPFLASH reporter assay.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Collectively, the results from our study suggest that Imipramine alone and in combination with Lomustine can be used for treating recurrent GBM.

Mutations in this pathway induce overexpression of Wnt genes resulting in a variety of human cancers including breast, colorectal, and ovarian. Canonical Wnt signaling is &#946;-catenin-dependent and when active, &#946;-catenin forms a complex with transducin &#946;-like protein 1 (TBL1) and transducin &#946;-like related protein 1 (TBLR1) to promote gene TCF\/LEF-dependent expression downstream the Wnt pathway. Previously we developed a small-molecule inhibitor that disrupts this protein complex to inhibit Wnt signaling and promote a cytotoxic effect in tumor cells. While this approach is effective, our current efforts are focused to develop a peptide-based therapy that targets the &#946;-catenin\/TBL1 complex which will result in increased target specificity and less overall toxicity compared to small-molecule counterparts. We have generated a library of peptides corresponding to the binding interface of &#946;-catenin and TBL1 with the aim of developing a specific drug that disrupts the complex.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Selected peptides were tested for their ability to affect the aberrant Wnt pathway on the Wnt-activated colon cancer cell line SW480. Displacement of &#946;-catenin from TBL1 was assessed using a heterologous competition ELISA screen in cell lysate. Hit peptides were identified then tested for specific binding to recombinant TBL1 using an additional ELISA. Further validation to determine associated levels of &#946;-catenin with and without peptide treatment was performed with a co-immunoprecipitation. In situ detection of &#946;-catenin\/TBL1 complex dissociation in response to peptide treatment was investigated with a proximity ligation assay (PLA). A ubiquitin enrichment kit was used to measure induced &#946;-catenin degradation. Hit peptides were tested with a viability assay for efficacy in their ability to promote a cytotoxic effect on tumor cells. Transcriptional TCF\/LEF activation, which is promoted by &#946;-catenin, was evaluated with TOPFlash in the Wnt activated TCF\/LEF reporter HEK293 cell line.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We identified a series of peptides that selectively bind TBL1 and displace &#946;-catenin from the complex in Wnt-driven colon cancer cell line SW480 in a dose-dependent manner. Further, we found that treatment with 5 &#956;M peptides in TCF\/LEF reporter cells significantly blocks the activity of TCF\/LEF, inhibiting downstream transcription of Wnt genes. The disruption of the &#946;-catenin\/TBL1 complex results in the ubiquitination of &#946;-catenin. Our findings confirmed this data showing that peptide treatment depletes ubiquitinated &#946;-catenin over time. When these peptides are used to treat Wnt-driven tumor cells, they display strong on-target cytotoxic effects indicating a potential clinical application for the use of these specific peptides as a novel therapeutic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Peptides,&#946;-catenin,Wnt signaling,Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shelby Rheinschmidt<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Trason Thode<sup><\/sup>, Samuel Sampson<sup><\/sup>, Alexis Weston<sup><\/sup>, Tithi Ghosh Halder<sup><\/sup>, Serina Ng<sup><\/sup>, Sydney Adamson<sup><\/sup>, Kate Gutowsky<sup><\/sup>, Mohan Kaadige<sup><\/sup>, Raffaella Soldi<sup><\/sup>, Sunil Sharma<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>TGen (The Translational Genomics Research Institute), Phoenix, AZ","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1cedf707-b9eb-4d39-9a0c-f3ed7024deaa","ControlNumber":"7640","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

A long-standing goal in oncology has been to develop therapeutics to effectively target both cell states. Growing published evidence suggests that accumulation of reactive oxygen species and lipid remodeling make tolerant and resistant tumor cells more vulnerable to ferroptotic mode of cell death. To this end, we here characterize the activity of a proprietary inhibitor of GPX4, an enzyme that safeguards against ferroptosis, across a panel of tolerant and resistant cell line models. Drug tolerant and resistant cancer cell lines spanning three indications were generated by applying continuous treatments with relevant standard-of-cares (SOC) <i>in vitro<\/i> for short or long durations, respectively. Age-matched control cell lines were derived in parallel by treatment of parental cells with DMSO. Cells were subjected to high dose of SOC for nine days to generate tolerant lines, or to increased therapeutic doses of SOC over three months to generate resistant lines, after which resistance to SOCs was confirmed. In accordance with our hypothesis, we found that drug tolerant lines demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to GPX4 inhibition compared to age-matched control lines. Furthermore, we noted that resistant tumor cell lines retained exquisite sensitivity to GPX4 inhibition across all indications while demonstrating up to 1000-fold resistance to SOCs. In summary, we found that cell line models which evade cell death upon treatment with chemo- or targeted therapies continued to present vulnerability to ferroptosis induction across both cell states. Given the heterogeneity in responses to drug-induced cell-states, understanding the mechanisms of differential drug sensitivity to GPX4 inhibition may help in formulating successful strategies for targeting this relevant cell population in the clinic, thereby limiting cancer progression and\/or improving curative potential.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug resistance,Cell death,Reactive oxygen species,Small molecule inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Taronish Dubash<sup><\/sup>, Maria Cristina Munteanu<sup><\/sup>, Shrouq Farah<sup><\/sup>, Cristian Nunez<sup><\/sup>, Laurence Jadin<sup><\/sup>, Branko Radetich<sup><\/sup>, Darby Schmidt<sup><\/sup>, <b>Nadia Gurvich<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>SonataTherapeutics, Watertown, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1bb5fe63-3858-4886-a71f-6c6e6f5a0187","ControlNumber":"7710","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

Unchecked tumor cell proliferation, as well as macrophage proliferation, contributes to tumor growth and spread. Inhibitors of PI3K or MEK signaling pathways can initially inhibit tumor growth until resistance due to upregulation of the alternative pathway develops. We identified a novel allosteric cKIT\/FLT3\/CSF1R inhibitor that induces synthetic lethality in AML, lung carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma and other tumor cells and in proliferating macrophages in vitro and in tumors in vivo by simultaneously inhibiting the MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT pathways and activating stress activated kinase-mediated cell cycle arrest. A series of related cKIT\/FLT3\/CSF1R\/PDGFR allosteric inhibitors suppressed receptor tyrosine phosphorylation as well as downstream MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT signaling and mTorc1 and cMyc gene expression pathways that control cell growth. Select cKIT\/FLT3\/CSF1R\/PDGFR inhibitors with a unique positioning of a single side chain also inhibited CDK8\/19 and stimulated phosphorylation and activation of JNK and p38. JNK activation promoted sustained ATF-2 and cJun-mediated p53 and Chk1\/Chk2 activation, thereby promoting cell cycle arrest in G2\/M and ultimately, apoptosis. These inhibitors potently suppressed tumor growth in vivo by halting tumor cell and macrophage proliferation in G2\/M. They synergized with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 and led to tumor eradication and immunological memory formation.

Preferred frontline treatment relies on anti-HER2 therapies, such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab, combined with microtubule inhibitors, such as taxanes. However, the clinical efficacy of taxanes is limited by development of chemoresistance and hematological and neurotoxicities. Other agents that target tubulin, such as colchicine-binding site inhibitors (CBSIs) are a class of promising alternatives to taxane therapy due to their ability to overcome P-gp-mediated taxane resistance. Sabizabulin (formerly known as VERU-111) is a potent CBSI that is orally bioavailable, overcomes paclitaxel resistance, and inhibits tumor growth and distant metastases in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Here, we demonstrate sabizabulin&#8217;s anti-cancer efficacy in HER2+ breast cancer. We report that sabizabulin inhibits proliferation of HER2+ breast cancer, maintains a low nanomolar IC50 value, inhibits colony formation, and causes apoptosis in HER2+ breast cancer cell lines. Sabizabulin inhibits the primary tumor growth in an orthotopic HER2+ in vivo model, BT474, and in a patient-derived xenograft model, HCI-12. While sabizabulin shows promising results for treatment in HER2+ breast cancer, we further optimized the structure of sabizabulin to create a new class of anti-cancer molecules: 40a, CH-2-77, and 60c. Based on in vitro data, 60c showed higher potency in HER2+ breast cancer cell lines and was chosen as the lead compound to further study in a paclitaxel-resistant triple negative breast cancer in vivo study where it was able to effectively inhibit primary tumor growth compared to the vehicle group.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,HER2,Metastasis,Tubulin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kelli  L.

Cascade of tumor suppressor genes (NF2, LATS1\/2) and multiple signals from cellular microenvironment (mechano-transduction) regulate YAP\/TAZ phosphorylation and degradation. The stabilized YAP\/TAZ translocate from cytoplasm to nucleus, where they bind with TEADs for transcriptional activation. YAP\/TAZ regulate numerous genes expression which play central roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis, tumor microenvironment remodeling, and drug resistance, making them appealing targets for cancer treatment. Disruption of YAP\/TAZ-TEAD protein-protein interaction (PPI) has been regarded as an effective approach to abolish YAP\/TAZ oncogenic activity. Previously we have reported the discovery of YAP\/TAZ-TEAD PPI hit compounds bound at the &#937; loop site of TEAD1. Here we report that the CADD-guided optimization of the hit compounds has yielded an orally available and potent YAP\/TEAD PPI inhibitor ETS-003 with favorable ADME properties and robust anti-tumor efficacy. ETS-003 could potently block YAP\/TAZ-TEAD PPI both <i>in vitro<\/i> and in cells, and disrupt YAP\/TAZ genome-wide chromatin binding, resulting in on-target inhibition of YAP transcriptome. ETS-003 exhibited broad anti-proliferative activity in a variety of solid tumor cell lines. In Hippo-YAP dysregulated mesothelioma models, ETS-003 showed profound anti-tumor activity and good PK\/PD\/efficacy correlation. Moreover, when combined with MAPK pathway inhibitors (Osimertinib, Sotorasib and MRTX1133), ETS-003 could significantly enhance the anti-proliferative activity, suggesting multiple combination opportunities for ETS-003 in clinical investigations. The non-GLP studies of ETS-003 showed favorable safety margin, and warranted further clinical studies of ETS-003 in solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"YAP\/TAZ,Novel anticancer small molecule,Protein-protein interactions,Hippo YAP pathway,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jiajun Lu<sup><\/sup>, Ming Gao<sup><\/sup>, Hao He<sup><\/sup>, Lijian Feng<sup><\/sup>, Zhenting Gao<sup><\/sup>, Wenqi Cui<sup><\/sup>, Kun Yang<sup><\/sup>, Jiting Lu<sup><\/sup>, Qiangang Zheng<sup><\/sup>, Jidong Zhu<sup><\/sup>, <b>Xin Guo<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>ETERN Biopharma Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ffdbd4f4-89ed-4749-a47f-d2b97a037201","ControlNumber":"7872","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Various types of second generation, non-steroidal anti-androgens (NSAA) including enzalutamide and apalutamide, have been widely used as single agents to treat patients with advanced disease. However, despite initial improvements, patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCPRC) frequently develop resistance, resulting in limited overall survival benefit. Darolutamide is a novel next-generation androgen receptor-signaling inhibitor that is FDA approved for non-metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) currently in phase III clinical trials and has shown efficacy and tolerability in treating nmCRPC. ONC201\/TIC10 is a first-in-class small molecule that activates the integrated stress response (ISR) and upregulates TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Our study investigates the ISR and AR signaling as mechanisms for antitumor efficacy with ONC201 and enzalutamide or darolutamide as single agents or in combination against mCRPC in vitro and in vivo. We previously reported that ONC201 synergizes with daroluatmide in inhibiting cell viability, upregulating ISR, inducing apoptosis, reducing prostate specific antigen (PSA) and AR signaling in CRPC cell lines 22RV1, LNCaP, DU145 and PC3. To test the novel combinatorial treatment in vivo, we established a subcutaneous CRPC mouse xenograft model with luciferase expressing 22RV1 cells, 22RV1-LUC. Tumors were routinely measured with a digital caliper and bioluminescence imaging. After tumor size reached 150mm3, mice were randomly assigned to control and treatment groups with ONC201 (50mg\/kg or 100mg\/kg, p.o., t.i.w or b.i.w.) and\/or darolutamide (50mg\/kg, p.o., b.i.d) and\/or enzalutamide (20mg\/kg, p.o., q.d.) for 36 days. Preliminary results demonstrated significant antitumor efficacy in the high-dose ONC201 group (100mg\/kg, t.i.w.) and partial tumor regression in the combination groups. Flow cytometric analysis indicated preliminary trends of increased intratumor NK cells in mice treated with ONC201 and combination of ONC201 and darolutamide. Trends of increased TRAIL activation within NK cells were also observed in treatment groups. We are exploring the antitumor immune-modulatory effects of the combinatorial therapy that may have contributed to the partial reduction of tumor growth of 22RV1-LUC in an immunodeficient mouse model and biomarkers from the in vivo tissue samples. Our data provide insights to improved therapeutic benefits of combination treatment that can be further studied and developed for more efficient anticancer strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,ONC201,Enzalutamide,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jinxuan Laura Wu<sup><\/sup>, Lanlan Zhou<sup><\/sup>, <b>Maximilian Schwermann<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Leiqing Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Kelsey E.

Novel MGDs of GSPT1, a translation termination factor, elicit dysregulated protein translation termination and subsequent induction of TP53-independent apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells through activation of the integrated stress response. In addition, dysregulation of translation termination triggered by GSPT1 degradation appears to be cytotoxic specifically to MYC-driven cancers including solid tumors with translational addiction. Phase 1 clinical trials of three novel GSPT1 MGDs have been recently launched for the treatment of AML and\/or MYC-driven solid tumors (NCT02848001, NCT04336982, NCT05546268, and NCT05144334). Herein, we present novel GSPT1 MGDs and their pre-clinical results against AML and solid tumors. Our current lead GSPT1 MGDs induced rapid, potent, and durable degradation of GSPT1, resulting in strong inhibition of tumor cell growth in a variety of cell lines of MYC-driven solid tumor and blood cancer (AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia). Moreover, in ex-vivo assays using a panel of patient-derived primary AML cells, C-10386 was highly sensitive with EC50s at the nanomolar range. Furthermore, a related analogue (C-14207) showed excellent rodent PK profiles and demonstrated dose-dependent PKPD relationship and excellent efficacy in the NCI-H1155 NSCLC xenograft model. Finally, our current lead compounds showed safer profiles in various normal cells compared to other known GSPT1 degraders. Collectively, we have identified novel GSPT1 MGDs as promising development candidates for the treatment of AML and solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myc,Acute myeloid leukemia,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Min Sung Joo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, JaeYung Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Eun-Jung Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Dong Hyuk Ki<sup>1<\/sup>, Hunmi Choi<sup>1<\/sup>, Joonwoo Nam<sup>1<\/sup>, Jaewoo Park<sup>2<\/sup>, Keon Wook Kang<sup>2<\/sup>, Wooseok Han<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Cyrus Therapeutics, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>College of Pharmacy, Seoul National Univeresity, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e1cba2a7-0913-47e3-97a8-6ff2a2ac7d2d","ControlNumber":"2135","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.
