[{"Abstract":"Disease monitoring is important to detect cancer relapse, often as a result of a treatment-surviving cancer cell population. Detection of relapse is critical to determine the intensity and length of treatments and to predict the outcome of those treatments. Currently, karyotyping, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), flow cytometry, PCR, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) are often used for this application. PCR is sensitive and highly effective, but as a targeted approach, it requires the identification of an appropriate biomarker. Karyotyping and FISH are used to follow structural variants, especially those detected at diagnosis and known to be drivers of carcinogenesis; however, karyotype has low sensitivity (~5-10% variant allele frequency (VAF)) and FISH is only targeted.We describe a novel workflow to find structural variants (SVs) using optical genome mapping (OGM) and to use those SVs as biomarkers for disease monitoring assessment. The initial SV profile from a cancer sample can be obtained by running the standard somatic workflow for OGM: 1.5 Tbp of high molecular genomic DNA is collected (without any amplification\/selection), and molecules that can capture SV breakpoints are locally assembled into genome maps. These locally assembled genome maps are used to make high-confidence SV calls at least 5 kbp in size. Then, presumptive somatic variants are revealed by further comparison against an OGM control sample SV database (included in Bionano Access\/Solve software). Subsequently, to detect residual cancer cells post-treatment, an ultra-deep coverage of approximately 5 Tbp of DNA can be collected, and these molecules are directly aligned to the genome maps in the initial cancer sample. This direct alignment approach is fast and sensitive in identifying remnants of pretreatment originator cells. We are currently applying this workflow to recover known leukemia-associated inter-chromosomal translocations, and our preliminary results indicate a sensitivity of detecting calls at a minimum of 0.5% VAF. Continual investigation on limit of detection is ongoing, but with the improvement on throughput and algorithms, we envision that this workflow to be essential in discovering low level clonal cancerous DNA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-03 Cytogenetics and clinical molecular genetics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytogenetics,Cancer genetics,Cancer genomics,Tumor evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alex Chitsazan<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Andy Pang<sup><\/sup>, Alex Hastie<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Bionano Genomics, San Diego, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"afae2a49-9bd4-4ef5-8a8c-05978aace365","ControlNumber":"8055","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Understanding EMD genomics may inform targeted treatment approaches.<br \/>Methods: We obtained EMD samples from 15 patients (n=8 fresh and n=7 formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded). Second EMD biopsies were taken in n=3, with n=1 having 3 sequential EMD biopsies. 8 patients had peripheral blood plasma (Streck DNA tubes) for circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA). Germline variants were excluded using buccal swab DNA. DNA was extracted using QIAGEN DNeasy kit prior to whole genome sequencing (WGS) (30x; xGen PRISM library preparation; Illumina Novaseq).<br \/>Bioinformatics identified short nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number variations (CNVs) and structural variants (SV) using the Broad Institute GATK best practice pipeline, CNVpytor and Manta, respectively. Droplet digital PCR was used to confirm SNV and CNV findings, and to explore the presence of mutations in ctDNA.<br \/>Results: The median age at diagnosis of MM was 52 years (n=4 primary EMD, n=11 secondary EMD). 46% were hyperdiploid.<br \/>Driver mutations (DM) in the MAPK pathway were seen in 80%, primarily at codon 61 of NRAS and KRAS (n=5, n=3); only two non-p.Q61 mutations were seen (NRAS p.G13R and KRAS p.A146V). Three patients had activating BRAF mutations (two p.V600E, one p.G469A). Variant allele frequencies (VAF) of DM suggested clonal rather than subclonal level. A quarter of patients (26.6%) had loss of function TP53 mutations.<br \/>In those with no MAPK DM identified, the median whole genome SNV was 77,142 with a tumour mutational burden (TMB) of 15 mutations\/Mb, compared to 20,543 and 3.2 in DM patients. The median SNV and TMB increased with relapse or progression of EMD.<br \/>CNV\/SV analysis identified gain(3q), gain(1q), del(1p) and monosomy 13\/ del(13q) in 93%, 86%, 46% and 73% respectively. Gains of BRAF (66%) and MYC (53%) and loss of TP53 (40%) were frequent. Secondary translocations were seen in 40% of patients, involving MYC, FGFR3, CCND2 and CCND3 in 20%, 13%, 6% and 6%, respectively, and partnered with IGH, IGL and TXNDC5. The majority of SV had not been previously identified in these patients. There were increased numbers of CNV\/SV with relapsed EMD after therapy, with persistence of the MAPK DM and previously seen CNV\/SV.<br \/>Liquid biopsies show MAPK DM are present in ctDNA at the time of EMD biopsy. The same DM are detectable in the blood prior to development of EMD, suggesting DM clones arise early in disease course. The VAF of DM in ctDNA mirrors PET responses to therapy.<br \/>Conclusion: MAPK DM were frequent in EMD, and detectable in ctDNA, suggesting roles for both MAPK-targeted therapies and for ctDNA as a biomarker in these patients. A high TMB was identified in patients lacking a MAPK driver mutation; immunotherapy should be considered in this subgroup.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-07 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Extramedullary myeloma,Whole genome sequencing,Precision medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nicholas  E.

TET enzymes constitute a family of iron and &#945;KG-dependent dioxygenases that oxidize 5-methylcytosine in DNA to promote demethylation and the reversal of gene silencing. The TET enzymes require vitamin C for their optimal catalytic activity, however, many patients with hematological malignancies are vitamin C deficient. Enhancing and restoring TET function with high-dose vitamin C has been shown to block the progression of solid tumors and blood malignancies. A combination of genetic and epigenetic diversity in lymphoma can result in the aberrant overexpression of oncogenes, loss of tumor suppressor function, and genomic instability. Our research models Bcl2-driven B cell lymphoma with Tet-deficiency using transgenic RNAi for the knockdown of Tet1 or Tet2. In vitro, our results have shown that this model shows increased self-renewal capacity of early B cell progenitors and precursors that can be suppressed by genetic restoration of Tet expression or upon treatment with vitamin C. In vivo, the B cell compartment of mice with Bcl2 overexpression and Tet1 or Tet2 deficiency exhibit a block in B cell maturation during a long period of pre-malignancy, and a decreased frequency of follicular B cells in the spleen from 3 months of age. Our aim is to determine mechanistically the effects of Tet-deficiency on B cell lymphoma progression and whether vitamin C can restore Tet activity to suppress lymphoma progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-04 Epigenetic therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TET1,Bcl-2 protein family,Epigenetics,Vitamin C,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Minh Quang Lam<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Luisa Cimmino<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"82aaaec8-1fe2-4ca1-affe-f7a42e2b0045","ControlNumber":"8236","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

While considered the gold standard, karyotyping and FISH have significant limitations in resolution of structural variants (SVs). CMA has a much higher resolution, but cannot detect balanced SVs, and is less commonly used in the hematologic oncology setting. Optical genome mapping (OGM) can detect all classes of SVs at high resolution (duplications, deletions, inversions, insertions, translocations), and as such, detects many copy number variants (CNVs) and SVs that have not been previously described. Although these novel SVs will help better describe genetic contributions to disease, analysis, interpretation and curation can take considerable time. A streamlined workflow has been developed for use with Bionano VIA&#8482; software for a comprehensive analysis of relevant SVs in a hematological malignancy genome. First, by employing disease-specific decision trees for variants published in guidelines for those conditions, the software automatically flags Tier 1A variants detected according to ACMG\/AMP\/CGC criteria. Second, the overall genome complexity is assessed by observing chromosomal abnormalities detected by OGM. Large events (&#62;5Mb) are counted, and complex genomes are assigned if there are more than 3 or 5 events, depending on the cancer type. Third, calls are further refined by filtering on a pan-cancer specific list to capture those variants that are then manually classified as Tier 1B or 2 by the analyst. The Bionano VIA software allows case-specific and disease subtype-specific information to be added to various sections within the software, such as the Knowledgebase, Event Table, and Sample Info fields to facilitate autopopulation of reportable data and interpretations into a formatted report template. Bionano VIA software can also accommodate multiple platforms simultaneously (e.g., NGS panels) to provide users with a comprehensive view of genomic aberrations relevant to hematological malignancies. This workflow is intended to streamline analysis and automate reporting of oncology samples, which can be extremely complex and often require extensive research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-03 Cytogenetics and clinical molecular genetics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytogenetics,Bioinformatics,Cancer diagnostics,Cancer genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Benjamin Clifford<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jen Hauenstien<sup><\/sup>, Andy Wing Chun Pang<sup><\/sup>, Rachel D.

We recently found that SET and MYND domain-containing 3 (SMYD3), a protein methyltransferase which has been reported to regulate global levels of trimethylated H3K4 (H3K4me3), an activating mark, and H4K20 (H4K20me3), a repressive mark, is overexpressed in HPV-negative HNSCC. Furthermore, we found that SMYD3 depletion impaired the colony formation capacity, cell cycling and the proliferation of HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines. Additionally, SMYD3 KO cell lines demonstrated decreased migratory potential. Accordingly, NSG xenograft mouse models of SMYD3 KO cell lines exhibited significantly decreased tumor growth compared to a parental HPV-negative HNSCC cell line. Based on the above preliminary results, this study aims to elucidate the specific mechanism(s) through which SMYD3 regulates the proliferative and migratory capacity of HPV-negative HNSCC cells. Nuclear\/cytoplasmic fractionation of a panel of HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines showed that SMYD3 is expressed both in the nuclear as well as the cytoplasmic compartments. siRNA-mediated knockdown of SMYD3 for 6 days induced A 40% decrease in global H3K4me3 and more than 80% decrease in global H4K20me3 levels. Genome-wide mapping of SMYD3, H3K4me3 and H4K20me3 was pursued using CUT&#38;RUN assays in parental and SMYD3 KO cell lines. The GoPeaks software was utilized to call significant peaks affected by 30% (p.adj&#60;0.05). 515 genes were annotated to H3K4me3 peaks and were found to have significantly decreased H3K4me3 peaks with concordant mRNA downregulation by more than 30%. 185 genes were annotated to H4K20me3 peaks and were found to have significantly decreased H4K20me3 peaks with concordant mRNA upregulation by more than 30%. Amongst these genes, cell cycle regulators and EMT genes were identified. SMYD3 peaks were called successfully and analysis of its genome-wide mapping is ongoing, with particular focus on cell cycle and EMT genes. To assess whether SMYD3 regulates the global H3K4me3 and H4K20me3, mass spectrometry analysis in SMYD3 KO cells has been conducted and analysis is ongoing. Validation of candidate genes directly regulated by SMYD3, H3K4me3 and H4K20me3 is planned by qPCR and Western blotting. This study is the first to report genome-wide mapping results of human SMYD3, and provides mechanistic insights into the oncogenic function of SMYD3 in HPV-negative HNSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-04 Epigenetic therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Transcription factor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Abbas Saeed<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Samantha Sevilla<sup><\/sup>, Vassiliki Saloura<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7f8180ea-9e4d-4e36-b7da-cb52d0696fa7","ControlNumber":"8182","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Studies to date have not determined the extent that diverse transcriptional programs drive SCLC and contribute to its lethality. We sought to characterize the intra-tumoral transcriptional heterogeneity of SCLC. We identify multivalent, distinct, and commutable transcriptional states that confer discrete functions in individual SCLC tumors.<br \/>Methods: We developed a biorepository of patient-derived xenografts (PDX) (<i>n<\/i> = 64) and matched PDX-derived <i>ex vivo <\/i>lines. We used multi-omic profiling (RNAseq, scRNAseq, and ATAC seq), single-cell fluorescence tracking of fate-defining transcription factor (TF)-driven states, and mathematical and statistical models (Markov chain) to study the topology of the SCLC transcriptional landscape and its plasticity. Human tumor material and associated clinical data were obtained after informed written consent on an IRB-approved prospective registry.<br \/>Results: We show that individual SCLC tumors are more heterogenous than previously appreciated, displaying distinctive equilibria in the proportion of cells within well-delimited cellular states (<i>ASCL1<\/i>, <i>NEUROD1<\/i> and <i>YAP1<\/i>). We also show that transcriptional states undergo transitions, which we identified as a mechanism for maintaining cell state diversity. We measured the kinetics of state transitions using single-cell fluorescence tracking of <i>ex vivo<\/i> cultures and found that these measure were associated significantly with transition estimates using stochastic transition theory (<i>i.e.<\/i> Markov chains). ATAC-seq profiling indicated a role for the epigenome in the state diversity of SCLC. Namely, there was preferential promoter accessibility to Ascl1, NeuroD1, and Yap1 in a manner consistent with gene and protein expression in the respective subpopulations. Our results indicate that the transition rates between cell types in individual tumors were largely governed by tendencies to reach an equilibrium state that are critical for configuring intratumoral cell state proportions.<br \/>Conclusion: In conclusion, we demonstrate that TF driven cell states can transition to maintain an equilibrium in cell state proportions. Our work advances a model of cellular states and program diversity in SCLC and nominates new therapeutic strategies designed to limit the plasticity of this lethal cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-07 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Heterogeneity,Multiomics,Fluorescence imaging,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Priyanka Gopal<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Aaron Petty<sup>2<\/sup>, Kevin Rogacki<sup>1<\/sup>, Titas Bera<sup>1<\/sup>, Rohan Bareja<sup>3<\/sup>, Craig Peacock<sup>4<\/sup>, Mohamed Abazeed<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Northwestern Univ.

Although SCLC is initially highly sensitive to chemotherapy (CHT), almost all patients acquire resistance within the course of the disease. A promising class of compounds to overcome drug resistance comprises histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), which have been shown to synergize with several CHT agents such as cisplatin. In this study, we addressed whether entinostat exhibits anti-cancer activity as single-therapy or in combination with CHT in SCLC. The efficacy of entinostat alone or in combination with CHT was determined using MTT-based viability assays and a mouse xenograft model. Synergistic drug interactions were evaluated using the combenefit software. Analysis of our previously published proteomic dataset comprised 1D annotation enrichment, DAVID functional annotation and ToppCluster analysis. Hypothetic mechanisms were also examined using ICP-MS and FACS-based cell cycle analysis. Class I HDAC inhibition by entinostat resulted in significantly stronger effects in neuroendocrine (NE) SCLC cell lines. Subsequent proteomic analysis revealed differentially expressed proteins and pathways that coincide with NE and non-NE characteristics. Since &#8220;platinum drug resistance&#8221; appeared in the corresponding pathway analysis, cell lines were exposed to cisplatin. A significant correlation was observed between entinostat and cisplatin responsiveness (r=0.8079, p=0.0003). With combination therapy, a strong synergism was detected in a subset of SCLC cell lines and validated in a mouse model. Importantly, similar effects were also found when entinostat was combined with etoposide, epirubicin or irinotecan. To address the underlying mechanism of the observed effects, another proteomic evaluation comparing cell lines with synergistic and additive features indicated changes in cell cycle regulation and DNA damage repair. Cell cycle analysis revealed similar distributions in control, entinostat and cisplatin conditions. However, synergistic cell lines displayed a shift from G1 to S-phase compared to additive cell lines upon combination treatment. Results from ICP-MS analysis revealed that although basal platinum levels were significantly higher in the synergistic subgroup, all SCLC cell lines showed increased intracellular platinum levels in the presence of entinostat. Here, we report that high NE expression profiles in SCLC cell lines are associated with increased sensitivity to HDAC inhibition and, moreover, that combinational therapy using entinostat and CHT results in strong synergism in a subset of SCLC cell lines featuring dysregulated cell cycle and DNA damage repair, according to proteomic analyses. Especially in SCLC, efficient therapeutic options in relapsed patients are missing, and deciphering the molecular basis of synergism between chemotherapy and entinostat might lead to more effective therapy for patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-04 Epigenetic therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: small cell,Cell cycle,Platinum drugs,HDAC inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anna Schwendenwein<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kristiina Boettiger<sup>1<\/sup>, Ildiko Kovacs<sup>2<\/sup>, Nandor Barany<sup>2<\/sup>, Christian Lang<sup>1<\/sup>, Zsolt Megyesfalvi<sup>2<\/sup>, Michael Grusch<sup>3<\/sup>, Walter Berger<sup>3<\/sup>, Christian Kowol<sup>4<\/sup>, Melinda Rezeli<sup>5<\/sup>, Konrad Hoetzenecker<sup>1<\/sup>, Balazs Döme<sup>1<\/sup>, Karin Schelch<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Thoracic Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Thoracic Surgery, Semmelweis University and National Institute of Oncology, Budapest, Hungary,<sup>3<\/sup>Center for Cancer Research, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria,<sup>4<\/sup>Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Biomedical Engineering, Lund University, Vienna, Austria","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"aff23821-8081-44ae-84ac-60d20fe60573","ControlNumber":"4581","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

We reasoned that specific epigenomic subsets in lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) operate with similar cellular programming showing TF dependency for lineage commitment and survival. We hypothesize that these dependencies on lineage programming are associated with a specific epigenomic landscape. Therefore, we investigated enrichment of SEs across the spectrum of LUADs to identify potential regulators for lineage commitment and survival.<br \/>We obtained data for genome-wide H3K27ac enrichment by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) on a total of 53 LUAD cell lines. We performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering of signals on SEs at gene loci annotated with transcriptional regulation identified in two or more cell lines. To Uncover 3D contact information, we employed HiChIP, using antibody against SMC1, a cohesin complex, on NCI-H460. Three LUAD cell lines with distinct enhancer profiles were transfected with five enhancer segments of the SE at the <i>PBX1<\/i> gene cloned into a Firefly luciferase plasmid. Lastly, four LUAD cell lines were treated with a PBX1 inhibitor, T417 for 72 hours in varying concentrations ranging from 20uM to 10nM and evaluated for sensitivity to the compound.<br \/>Clustering analysis identified LUADs with differential enhancer enrichment for TFs. Among those, we focused on the <i>PBX1<\/i> gene locus in LUADs harboring SEs proximal to its promoter. SMC1 HiChIP analysis on NCI-H460 suggest all enhancer segments are within a local topologically-associated domain with the <i>PBX1 <\/i>promoter. Luciferase reporter assay demonstrate activity of enhancer segments within the <i>PBX1<\/i> SE, unique to each cell line (NCI-H460, PC-9 and NCI-H1437), with enhancers e4 and e5 rendered the highest level of activity while e2 being the most active in PC-9. The effects of these enhancer segments are congruent to H3K27ac enrichment patterns. Treatment with T417 showed reduction in cell proliferation at an IC50 of 2.5 uM and 0.97 uM for NCI-H460 and PC-9, respectively, whereas T417 did not affect cell viability in NCI-H1792 and NCI-H125.<br \/>Data indicate a distinct subset of LUADs, enriched for the enhancer segments within the SE at the <i>PBX1<\/i> gene locus, at which the HiChIP data displayed the enhancer segments lie within the same topologically-associated domain. The enhancer activity of enhancer segments correlated with H3K27ac enrichment pattern for each cell line, suggesting enrichment correlates with impact. Data with PBX1 T417 exposure suggests dependency of PBX1 in maintaining lineage state and survival for unique subsets of LUADs. Further investigation is needed to determine if T417 dependent inhibition is uniform to all PBX1 active LUADs and if other LUAD subsets are dependent on other TFs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-07 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Cancer cell,Enhancer,Lung adenocarcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Douglas  M.

Recently, intracellular potential autophagy in addition to primary genetic alterations implicates the acquired drug resistance to targeted drugs in various carcinomas such as melanoma, pancreas, and breast cancer. We aimed to identify autophagy flux-related signal molecules which may be closely linked to acquired resistance in mEGFR NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: We constructed the TMA composed of 579 surgically resected tumor tissues from lung adenocarcinoma patients and evaluated protein expression of autophagy flux-related signal molecules including CAGE, p-Beclin1, LC3B, p-AMPK, ULK1, p62, and ATG5 using immunohistochemistry (IHC). We established H1975<sup>OSI <\/sup>(166-folds) and PC9<sup>ERL <\/sup>(3,650-folds) resistant sub cell lines through the prolonged exposure of Osimertinib and Erlotinib to H1975 (L858R\/T790M) and PC9 (Del19) cells, respectively. We also explored genes that induce autophagy flux activity using mRNA seq and qRT-PCR.<br \/>Results: H-score of CAGE ( 95.6&#177;7.9, 70&#177;5.5), p-AMPK (73.4&#177;7.8, 32&#177;5.6) and p-Beclin1 (44.4&#177;16.1, 19.7&#177;5.5), ULK1( 57.4&#177;4.9, 41.9&#177;4.9) were significantly higher in mEGFR, compared to those of wild type EGFR NSCLC (P &#60;0.001). According to EGFR mutation subtype, the expressions of CAGE (98&#177;11.2, 70&#177;5.5) and ULK1(60.7&#177;5.0, 41.9&#177;4.9) were significantly higher in Del19 (P&#60;0.001), while the expressions of CAGE(93.2&#177;5.6, 70&#177;5.5,), p-AMPK(82.9&#177;5.7, 32&#177;5.6), and p-Beclin1(45.6&#177;16.7, 19.7&#177;5.5) were significantly higher in L858R (P&#60;0.001). In advanced\/metastatic mEGFR NSCLC patients treated with EGFR TKIs, p-Beclin1(13.0&#177;10.9, 59&#177;7.2) expression was significantly increased, when comparing before treatment and at treatment failure (P&#60;0.018). As results of mRNA seq and qRT-PCR in H1975 parental cells and H1975<sup>OSI <\/sup>cells, we identified autophagy flux-related signal molecules including BECLIN1, GABAR1, NBR1, PINK1, ULK1 which were significantly increased more than 10 times.<br \/>Conclusion: Taken together, our results strongly support the evidence that autophagy flux-related signal molecules as well as known genetic alterations are closely connected to the acquired resistance during period of EGFR TKI treatment in mEGFR NSCLC patients. Now, we are undergoing additional RNA profiling and function study of identified novel autophagy-related genes to examine a possibility as potential target to overcome EGFR TKI resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-09 Tumor staging: Correlation of clinical and molecular markers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI),Lung cancer: non-small cell,Resistance,Autophagy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jeong-Oh Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Jung-Young Shin<sup>1<\/sup>, Min-Young Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Mi-Ran Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Seoree Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Hankyu Lee<sup>3<\/sup>, Doyong Jeon<sup>3<\/sup>, Seung Ryel Baek<sup>4<\/sup>, Kim Joo Il<sup>4<\/sup>, Kyoungjune Lee<sup>4<\/sup>, Youn Soo Lee<sup>5<\/sup>, <b>Jin-Hyoung Kang<\/b><sup>6<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Laboratory of Medical Oncology, Cancer Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Medical Hemato-Oncology, Bucheon St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Bucheon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>L-Base Company, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>R&D Center, Daewon Pharmaceutical, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>5<\/sup>Hospital Pathology, Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>6<\/sup>Medical Oncology, Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b0d915e5-5e28-4344-ae91-2c6b0cfd7087","ControlNumber":"2770","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

To address this clinical need, our group has adapted and clinically validated the CNS tumor classifier that was pioneered and developed by the German Cancer Research Network (DKFZ) and University Hospital Heidelberg for both adult and pediatric CNS tumors. The classifier analyzes whole genome methylation data derived from the Illumina EPIC array system with a machine learning algorithm trained on a large reference set to provide a tumor family and class (a more granular classification than family) along with calibrated scores to aid in determining confidence in the assigned classifications. Around this core algorithm, we have generated a computational and reporting pipeline to generate a mid-throughput clinical diagnostic assay. We have validated this assay using a combination of adult and pediatric CNS tumor samples and have established reliable run-level and sample-level quality control metrics with empirically defined thresholds. With these thresholds, approximately 90% of samples with a neoplastic content of 70% or greater were &#8220;classifiable&#8221;, such that a result could be returned by the CNS tumor diagnostic assay. The performance of the assay was exceptional, with a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy each greater than 98% as determined with a validation sample set of 105 specimens. Further, 4 discordant calls between the original diagnosis and the output of the new methylation-based diagnostic were identified and underwent further histopathologic review. This additional analysis led to the re-classification of 2 specimens due to molecular analysis, highlighting the clinical utility of the assay.

The field of epitranscriptomics has emerged as a novel druggable target for multiple diseases, including cancers, with N<sub>6<\/sub>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6<\/sup>A) as the most prevalent mRNA modification. M<sup>6<\/sup>A levels are modified by &#8216;writers&#8217; such as METTL3, METTL14 and WTAP and &#8216;erasers&#8217; such as FTO and ALKBH5. The interplay between these two processes dynamically regulates the m<sup>6<\/sup>A modification. The fate of modified RNA is determined by the m<sup>6<\/sup>A-bound &#8216;readers&#8217; such as YTHDF1 or YTHDF2 with rapid effects on translation and mRNA abundance. In the present study, we sought to investigate the functional importance of m<sup>6<\/sup>A RNA methylation in the pathogenesis and drug resistance of HGG.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence for m<sup>6<\/sup>A modulators were undertaken in patient-derived HGG cell lines, paediatric HGG cells and human HGG tissues. The expression of these modulators was modified using siRNA knockdown and small molecules (such as a novel METTL3 inhibitor) to identify effects on key transcription factors in HGG. The effect of modification on stemness behaviours such as the ability to form neurospheres was also assessed. Developing chemotherapy-resistant cell lines, 3d cell culture and hypoxic cell culture were undertaken to assess associations between m<sup>6<\/sup>A RNA levels and the ability of HGG cells to adapt to environmental change. Measuring the level of m<sup>6<\/sup>A-modified transcripts were achieved by developing a MeRIP (methylated RNA immunoprecipitation) qPCR technique. An LC-MS\/MS based protocol was developed to quantify m<sup>6<\/sup>A levels on poly-A<sup>+<\/sup>-enriched RNA.<br \/><sup><\/sup><b>Results: <\/b>We found that key m<sup>6<\/sup>A RNA methylation effectors such as METTL3, FTO and WTAP are expressed at significantly higher level in HGG cell lines and tissues than in control cells (astrocytes) at both gene and protein levels. LC-MS\/MS and immunofluorescence showed an increase in the level of m<sup>6<\/sup>A in paediatric HGG compared with normal brain. Furthermore, knockdown of METTL3, FTO and WTAP affects the expression of key transcription factors in self-renewal, cell cycle regulation and tumorigenesis including FOXM1, nestin and SOX2. Depletion of m<sup>6<\/sup>A mediators also reduces the ability of cells to form neurospheres, increases apoptosis and suppresses invasion. Moreover, chemical inhibition of METTL3 and FTO was associated with a downregulation in the expression of oncogenes, reduction in neurosphere size and increase in apoptosis. Inhibitors of m<sup>6<\/sup>A effectors also sensitize HGG cell lines to the effect of chemotherapeutic agents such as temozolomide.

Despite extensive efforts to develop a new treatment, the prognoses of patients have not changed dramatically over the past several decades. LSD1 plays an essential role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in many cancer cells, including GBM, as it removes methyl groups from histone H3 lysine (K) 4me1\/2 and H3K9me1\/2. Since it was reported that suppression of LSD1 induced apoptosis of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), LSD1 has been expected as an effective therapeutic target for GBMs, particularly enriched with GSCs. We newly discovered an LSD inhibitor (S2172) that suppressed the LSD1 enzymatic activity effectively and sufficiently penetrated into brain. We found that S2172 showed a strong inhibitory effect on cell growth not only in GCS cells but also in differentiated GBM cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. In GBM cell line U251, IC50 of S2172 was lower than that of other LSD1 inhibitors (IC50 10.5 &#956;M, 29.5 &#956;M, 11.0 &#956;M treated with S2172, Ory-1001, and CC-90011, respectively). We also found a robust suppression of transcription of oncogene Myc in differentiated GBM cells after S2172 treatment, which is highly expressed in most GBM cells and considered as a key element to maintain its stemness and proliferation. Consistent with the expression analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed that enrichment of H3K4m2 and H3K4m3 was efficiently altered by S2172 treatment along with the change of Myc expression. Finally, we treated U251 brain tumor mouse model with S2172. While S2172 had a strong effect <i>in vitro<\/i>, S2172 seemed unsuccessful in killing differentiated GBM cells <i>in vivo<\/i>. These data suggests that treatment of S2172 is less effective to differentiated GBM cells and this is consistent with previous report that LSD1 as a candidate therapeutic target in stem-like tumor propagating cells in GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-04 Epigenetic therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Glioblastoma multiforme,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tokunaga Kota<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2c413ce5-12d2-4bb9-8d0d-2f18d432ccca","ControlNumber":"1456","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

However, a combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin is the only treatment for advanced unresectable cholangiocarcinoma currently, and the cancer can become resistant to the treatment, contributing to the high mortality. CPI-613 is a lipoic acid analog, which can inhibit dehydrogenases and disrupt mitochondrial metabolism. It is regarded as a promising anti-cancer drug and has been tested in multiple clinical trials. Efficacy and working mechanisms of CPI-613 have not been established in cholangiocarcinoma. In this study, we aim to evaluate the performance of CPI-613 in combination with other therapeutic drugs and unravel the metabolic underpinnings. We treated cholangiocarcinoma cell lines with different genetic backgrounds with standard of care chemotherapy (gemcitabine and cisplatin) alone, CPI-613 alone, or the combination of the two. Results from viability assay showed that CPI-613 had synergistic (not simply additive) effects with standard of care chemotherapy. CPI-613 has a relatively short half-life, so longer infusion may be more beneficial even if the total dose remains the same. To mimic longer infusion, we treated the cells with multiple times of drug addition (fractional dosing), and compared the results to single addition. Oxygen consumption rate (an indicator of mitochondrial function) of cells under fractional dosing regimen was significantly lower in both short and long term, as measured by Agilent Seahorse and Resipher respectively. The results provided mechanistic support for longer infusion in clinical practice. We also collected plasma from patients before, during and after CPI-613 treatment in a clinical trial, and global metabolomics was performed. Global metabolomic changes induced by CPI-613 were identified and specific alternations in patients with complete response could be exploited as treatment targets or prediction markers. High frequency of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation is a characteristic of cholangiocarcinoma. Ivosidenib, an IDH1 inhibitor, has been shown to improve survival in chemotherapy-refractory cholangiocarcinoma patients in a phase 3 clinical trial. However, ivosidenib can increase alpha-ketoglutarate concentration, hence increasing the flux of TCA cycle and boosting mitochondrial fitness of the cancer cells. We hypothesized that the combination of CPI-613 and Ivosidenib could negate this effect and have better anti-cancer activities. Indeed, results from viability assay demonstrated synergy between CPI-613 and Ivosidenib. Metabolic flux analysis and global metabolomics were performed to illustrate the metabolic mechanisms of the combination of CPI-613 and Ivosidenib. Our study provides the mechanistic support for the use of CPI-613 in combination with other therapeutic agents and the results should be translated to clinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-06 Laboratory correlates for targeted agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,Metabolism,Metabolomics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Fulei Wuchu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Olamide Animasahun<sup>2<\/sup>, Srinadh Choppara<sup>3<\/sup>, Valerie Gunchick<sup>3<\/sup>, Minal Nenwani<sup>1<\/sup>, Jyotirmoy Roy<sup>1<\/sup>, Miya Paserba<sup>1<\/sup>, Abhinav Achreja<sup>3<\/sup>, Vaibhav Sahai<sup>3<\/sup>, Deepak Nagrath<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI,<sup>2<\/sup>Chemical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI,<sup>3<\/sup>University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"528d47fe-31ca-4e17-8bd8-33a7d05350be","ControlNumber":"7053","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

With only moderate responses to cytotoxic chemotherapy and despite the development of targeted therapies, treatment success has been hindered by primary or acquired resistance. New therapeutic strategies are necessary to improve outcomes in these patients. NXP800 is a heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) small-molecule inhibitor with activity previously noted in ovarian cancers with ARID1A mutations. ARID1A mutations are common, well-known players in cholangiocarcinoma. In preclinical exploratory studies, we examined treatment responses in validated cholangiocarcinoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) models.<br \/>Methods: In our preliminary studies we evaluated response to HSF1 inhibition in a single, ARID1A wildtype PDX model. Xenografts were expanded into the flank of NOD\/SCID mice and treatment begun when tumors averaged 120mm3. 16 tumor bearing mice were randomized and 8 mice were grouped into both the treatment and control arms. Mice were then treated with either NXP800 (35 mg\/kg), in the treatment arm, or vehicle, in the control arm, via oral gavage 5 days on, 2 days off, for 28 days. Tumor volume and animal weight were collected twice weekly.<br \/>Results: After screening of our Human CCA PDX library of 57 patients, we identified an established and histologically validated PDX from a patient with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma obtained at surgical resection. Molecular characterization of the tumor identified NRAS Q61 mutation, FGFR1 and FGFR2 overexpression, androgen receptor overexpression, microsatellite stability, and a total tumor mutational burden of 2.6. RNA sequencing was completed and an evaluation of a 21-gene signature of YAP activity had identified this PDX as having an elevated activity signature compared to a cohort of 27 additional PDX tumors. Treatment with NXP800 was associated with a statistically significant decrease in tumor size compared to control tumor bearing mice, with a mean difference of the delta in tumor volume (852.6 mm3; 95% CI: 321 - 1384; P-value = 0.0057).<br \/>Conclusion: NXP800, a HSF1 inhibitor, demonstrated significant therapeutic activity in a cholangiocarcinoma PDX. Further studies are needed and being performed to determine the role of HSF1 inhibition in human cholangiocarcinoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-06 Laboratory correlates for targeted agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cholangiocarcinoma,ARID1A,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Heat shock proteins,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Danielle  M.

We aimed to identify RAS activity-related features in PC patients with liver metastasis (LM), to create a murine xenograft model of human PC cells representative of RAS-driven aggravation.<br \/>Methods: RAS activities in 77 patients who underwent needle biopsy for LM of treatment-na&#239;ve PC were measured using an RAS signature score from a comprehensive cDNA microarray dataset of LM samples. Changes in the sum of the longest diameter of the target lesion in the first month of chemotherapy (&#916;SLD), laboratory data and anorexia score at baseline were evaluated. Gene modules to be correlated with RAS activity and aggravation were evaluated using weighted co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Human PC cells were classified as high and low activity according to in silico analysis of the DepMap CCLE expression dataset for profiling RAS activity and the best hub gene expression in the gene module. Subcutaneous xenograft models of human PC cells with high and low activity in severe combined immunodeficiency mice were compared to explore the RAS-related phenotype.<br \/>Results: KRAS-mutated LM was detected in 70 of the 77 PC patients (90.9%). RAS signatures were up-regulated in patients with KRAS-mutated LM (P &#60; 0.01), high serum level of C-reactive protein (P = 0.01) as a systemic inflammatory marker, high expression of IL-6 mRNA by the tumor (P = 0.12) as an index of tumor-driven inflammation, and high level of phospho-Erk (P = 0.03). In 58 PC patients receiving first-line chemotherapy for KRAS-mutated LM, &#916;SLD in patients with a high RAS signature was increased as compared to those in patients with a low RAS signature (P = 0.045). WGCNA methods revealed that the green module highly correlated with RAS activity and aggravation. Based on in silico analysis with classification of the human PC cell lines CFPAC-1 and SUIT-2 into high and low activity cells, respectively, CFPAC-1 tumors showed desmoplasia and high expression of tumor IL-6 and liver SAA1 as compared to SUIT-2 tumors (P = 0.046 and P = 0.016, respectively).<br \/>Conclusions: Tumor RAS activity is related to inflammation-related aggravation in PC patients. RAS-related inflammation can be accurately presented in a murine model of human PC cells, which might be an effective tool to test the inhibition of RAS-driven inflammation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-07 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Ras,Inflammation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shuichi Mitsunaga<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mari Masuda<sup>2<\/sup>, Hiroki Yoshimatsu<sup>3<\/sup>, Yoichi Kamei<sup>3<\/sup>, Mitsuhito Sasaki<sup>4<\/sup>, Kazuo Watanabe<sup>4<\/sup>, Masafumi Ikeda<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Division of Biomarker Research, Exploratory Oncology Research and Clinical Trial Center, National Cancer Center, Kashiwa, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Division of Clinical Pharmacology and Translational Research, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Pfizer R&D Japan, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital East, Kashiwa, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"dcaf6ff3-1b68-48bc-9574-77aa486a9f41","ControlNumber":"2170","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

In particular, Tetraspanins (TSPANs)&#8212;a family of four-span transmembrane proteins&#8212;have been proposed as &#8220;master organizers&#8221; of multi-molecular membrane complexes by associating with specific partners and thus contributed to the progression of many cancer types. To date, transcriptomic analysis of all human <i>TSPANs<\/i> in colorectal cancer (CRC) has remained unclear. Here, we focused on utilizing next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to explore the expression level of <i>TSPANs <\/i>in primary tumor tissues of CRC, which is a complex disease and the second cause of cancer mortality worldwide.<br \/>Experimental Procedures: Resected primary tumor tissues of CRC were collected from 100 patients along with the written informed consents. Later, total RNA was extracted from all frozen patient tissues. RNA-Seq of those RNA samples was next done before the transcriptomic analysis of <i>TSPANs<\/i> in CRC was performed. Immunofluorescence (IF) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains were also employed to confirm the target protein expression in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE) slides from CRC patients.<br \/>Results: As a result of transcriptomic analysis of <i>TSPANs<\/i> in CRC tissues, among 33 human TSPANs, the high expression levels (transcript per million above the average of all <i>TSPANs<\/i>) of <i>TSPAN1<\/i>, <i>TSPAN8<\/i>, <i>TSPAN24<\/i>, <i>TSPAN29<\/i> and <i>TSPAN30<\/i> were observed in the patient-derived CRC tissues. Notably, the expression level of <i>TSPAN8<\/i> was comparable with that of <i>EPCAM<\/i>, which is a well-known tumor marker. Moreover, the high expression of TSPAN8 protein could be clearly observed in both IF and IHC-stained FFPE slides from CRC patients. Our result highlights the possible relevance of these overexpressed TSPANs in CRC development.<br \/>Conclusions: This study is the first RNA-Seq-based transcriptomic analysis of all human<i> TSPANs<\/i> in CRC. Our finding suggests the significant overexpression of particular <i>TSPANs<\/i>, especially <i>TSPAN8<\/i>, in CRC. Further analyses will be beneficial for translational research in CRC. The overexpression of <i>TSPANs<\/i> may suggest a framework to further explore diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive surface biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and other applications for CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-10 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Molecular profiling,Colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Thanawat Suwatthanarak<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Pariyada Tanjak<sup><\/sup>, Amphun Chaiboonchoe<sup><\/sup>, Onchira Acharayothin<sup><\/sup>, Kullanist Thanormjit<sup><\/sup>, Tharathorn Suwatthanarak<sup><\/sup>, Watsaphon Tangkullayanone<sup><\/sup>, Manop Pithukpakorn<sup><\/sup>, Vitoon Chinswangwatanakul<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Mahidol University, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9a0a6d9a-0f19-4db0-a0c8-b854f44a03c6","ControlNumber":"3308","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

Immune evasion is a hallmark of <i>KRAS<\/i>-driven cancer, but the role of <i>KRAS<\/i><sup>mut<\/sup> in the regulation of the immune response is unclear, particularly in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which often assists cancer cells to thrive and successfully escape immune surveillance. Here, we explore the immunobiological impacts of <i>KRAS<\/i><sup>mut<\/sup> in CRC patients.<br \/>Methods: A total of 97 fresh frozen tumor samples were collected from each CRC patient with stage I-IV who underwent surgical treatment at the Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital between October 2010 and March 2011. First, all patients were identified <i>KRAS<\/i><sup> <\/sup>mutational status and compared overall survival (OS) with wild-type<i> <\/i><i>KRAS <\/i>(<i>KRAS<\/i><sup>wt<\/sup>). Next, we analyzed the gene expression profiling of<i> KRAS<\/i><sup>mut <\/sup>which was performed using the Nanostring platform. Finally, we performed the biological network analysis focusing on immunological pathways associated with <i>KRAS<\/i><sup>mut<\/sup><sup> <\/sup>using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA).<br \/>Results: We observed <i>KRAS<\/i><sup>mut <\/sup>in 41.24% (n=40) of the total cases. Mutations occurred primarily in exon 2 (total n=36; codon 12, n=28; codon 13, n=8) and rarely in exon 3 (n=4). Patients with<i> <\/i><i>KRAS<\/i><sup>mut <\/sup><i>CRC<\/i> in exon 2 and exon 3, showed significantly worse OS compared to <i>KRAS<\/i><sup>wt<\/sup> (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.07-2.93; <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.05). Comparing gene expression profiles between<i> KRAS<\/i><sup>mut <\/sup>and <i>KRAS<\/i><sup>wt<\/sup>, found that the survival outcome of patients with <i>KRASmut was<\/i><sup> <\/sup>correlated with immunosuppressive TME by activation of genes encoded in TGF&#946; signaling pathway. In addition to activating TGF&#946; pathway, the gene expression profile of <i>KRAS<\/i><sup>mut<\/sup> also interrupted gene encoded pro-inflammatory cytokines, including <i>TNFRSF12<\/i>, <i>IRF6<\/i>, <i>CCR2<\/i>, <i>CCL8<\/i>, <i>CCL11<\/i>, <i>CXCR3<\/i> and <i>CXCL10<\/i>. IPA analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes of <i>KRAS<\/i><sup>mut<\/sup> were significantly enriched in regulation of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and macrophage-stimulating protein receptor d'origine nantais (MSP-RON) signaling pathways (<i>P<\/i> value&#60;0.001), which are strongly associated with maintaining the stability of the TME and contributing to immune escape in the immune TME.<br \/>Conclusions: Our results suggested that KRASmut activated TGF&#946; and interrupted pro-inflammatory cytokine to suppress tumor immune microenvironment in CRC.

Development of novel therapeutics with minimal side-effect is an urgent issue. Our previous study showed that cyproheptadine (CPH), an anti-histamine, exhibited antitumor activity in UC in vitro and in an xenograft model. In this study, we performed RNA-Seq to examine genes that are differentially expressed after treatment with CPH in UC cells. Our result showed that several genes, including IRF6, were upregulated after treatment with CPH in BFTC905 UC cells. Further experiments found that treatment of CPH could restore the expression of IRF6 in several other UC cell lines, which is due to promoter hypomethylation and enrichment of H3K27 acetylation, as well as H3K4 mono-methylation. Importantly, treatment of CPH can inhibit tumor growth in a syngeneic mouse tumor model. The tumor growth can be further inhibited by combination treatment of CPH and immune checkpoint blockade. Flow cytometric analysis of the tumor found that NK cells are significantly enriched in the CPH treatment group, as compared to DMSO control. Co-culture experiments confirmed that UC cells pretreated with CPH showed an increased NK-92-mediated cytotoxicity. In conclusion, these results suggested that treatment of CPH can inhibit tumor growth, by epigenetic priming of IRF6 in UC. The role of CPH in eliciting anti-tumor innate immune response deserves further investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-04 Epigenetic therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Epigenetics,Histone modification,DNA methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Pie-Che Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Guan-Ling Lin<sup>2<\/sup>, Hon-Yi Lin<sup>3<\/sup>, Wan-Hong Huang<sup>2<\/sup>, Yu-Ming Chuang<sup>2<\/sup>, Ru-Inn Lin<sup>3<\/sup>, Shu-Fen Wu<sup>2<\/sup>, Cheng-Huang Shen<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Michael W.Y.

While increasing CIN is linked to poor patient outcomes in select cancers, the prognostic significance of CIN, and its association with molecular phenotypes and therapeutic response in advanced prostate cancer (PCa) is poorly understood. We characterize CIN in aggressive Pca by integrating DNA\/RNA sequencing with detailed clinical information.<br \/>Methods: From 4\/2005-7\/2021, 290 men with advanced PCa underwent IRB-approved tissue collection for tumoral RNA-sequencing and tumor\/normal whole exome sequencing. DNA\/RNA sequencing data for 328 libraries across 304 biopsies was processed using Turnkey Precision Oncology. CIN was measured using the weighted genome integrity index (wGII). Driver mutations (ETS fusions, SPOP, FOXA1 class 1, and CDK12 mutations), TP53 mutations and AR amplification status were determined. GSEA and EPIC were used for pathway\/immune deconvolution. Associations with overall survival (OS) from the time of biopsy were determined via multivariable analysis (MVA).<br \/>Results: 36 samples were from patients with localized disease (LD), 101 from metastatic hormone sensitive PCa (mHSPC) and 191 from metastatic castrate resistant PCa (mCRPC). wGII was associated with disease state: LD (median:0.28, IQR:[0.18-0.48]); mHSPCa (0.36, [0.21-0.58]); mCRPC (0.52, [0.35-0.62]) (p&#60;0.001). TP53 loss was associated with wGII, independent of disease state (p&#60;0.001). Strikingly, AR-amplifications were associated with increased wGII when controlled for disease state (p=2.2e-9). wGII was negatively associated with CD8+ T cell levels (R=-0.24,p=7.7e-4) and this remained significant on MVA adjusting for disease state and tumor purity (p=0.003). For mCRPC samples, GSEA of wGII-high tumors identified upregulation of EMT (q=6.8e-14) and downregulation of androgen response (q=2.7e-6). Additionally, wGII levels did not differ by prior exposure to enhanced hormonal agents or taxane therapy (p=0.82, p=0.70). Finally, high wGII was associated with worse OS when controlled for age, disease state, TP53 loss, AR amplification, and purity (HR: 3.28; 95% CI: 1.39-7.80, p=0.007).<br \/>Conclusions: We identify CIN as one of the strongest genetic predictors of poor patient outcomes in metastatic PCa.

In a contemporary retrospective series of primary retroperitoneal DDLPS and WDLPS (N=107), we sampled paired DD\/WD\/normal fat (NF) components of DDLPS and paired WD\/NF components of WDLPS. RNA-Seq data was normalized using the trimmed mean of M-value (TMM) algorithm, heteroscedasticity was removed, and differential expression analysis (DEA) performed. Gene sets enrichment analysis (GSEA) evaluated enrichment in biological hallmarks and was performed to overcome FDR correction of DEA and evaluate the ensemble. FDR threshold 0.05 was considered for significance. Marked transcriptional changes exist among paired components of DDLPS (DD, WD, NF) or WDLPS (WD, NF). Although DEA did not show significant changes between WD and NF components of DDLPS and WDLPS, GSEA analysis highlighted deregulation in hallmarks. An upregulation of G2M checkpoint and mitotic spindle gene sets was observed when WD components of DDLPS was compared to WDLPS and progressively increase in the DD component. Some targetable genes from the leading edge of these pathways (PLK1, AURKA, and EZH2) as well as the primary oncogenic drivers (MDM2, CDK4, and HMGA2) of liposarcoma were functionally validated with targeted agents in cell lines of DDLPS and WDLPS, supporting findings of transcriptomic analysis. We also observed that adipogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, cholesterol homeostasis, oxidative phosphorylation, and peroxisome gene sets were down-regulated in the DD component, while glycolysis was upregulated compared to WD components. When NF were compared with their paired tumor components, G2M checkpoint and mitotic spindle gene sets did not differ between DDLPS and WDLPS, suggesting these two hallmarks as tumor-specific. NF of patients with DDLPS demonstrated higher expression of adipogenesis, and other pathways related to metabolism suggesting its metabolic activation compared to NF of patients with WDLPS. In conclusion, changes distinguishing WDLPS\/DDLPS early at the WD stage and progressively increasing in the DD component of DDLPS supported the hypothesis of an orderly progression from WDLPS to DDLPS and represent a source of additional therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-07 Molecular classification of tumors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,RNA sequencing,Targeted therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sandro Pasquali<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Stefano Percio<sup>1<\/sup>, Dario Callegaro<sup>2<\/sup>, Silvia Martini<sup>1<\/sup>, Alessia Beretta<sup>1<\/sup>, Alessia Bertolotti<sup>3<\/sup>, Silvia Brich<sup>3<\/sup>, Paola Collini<sup>3<\/sup>, Marta Barisella<sup>3<\/sup>, Loris De Cecco<sup>1<\/sup>, Viviana Vallacchi<sup>1<\/sup>, Silvia Stacchiotti<sup>4<\/sup>, Matteo Benelli<sup>5<\/sup>, Alessandro Gronchi<sup>2<\/sup>, Nadia Zaffaroni<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Experimental Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Surgery, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Advanced Diagnostics, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy,<sup>5<\/sup>Hospital of Prato, Azienda USL Toscana Centro, Prato, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bc07b49b-f395-4af2-bd76-c48d60f4bbc4","ControlNumber":"4896","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Ghanaian women are diagnosed at younger ages with the more aggressive Triple Negative BC (TNBC) subtype where West African ancestry is associated with advanced BC diagnosis and higher mortality rates compared to age-matched women of European ancestry. Genomic comparisons of BC tumors from women of African and European ancestry show differences in frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and copy number variations. These differences may contribute to disparities in disease and treatment outcomes observed in women of African ancestry. Chemotherapy plays a major role in treatment of recurrent and metastatic BC. Long-term BC survival remains poor especially in Africa due to multidrug resistance (MDR). MDR has been associated with binding cassette (ABC) protein transporters. ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2 are ABC transporter genes that code for proteins involved in drug efflux. We hypothesize that SNPs in ABC transporter genes may alter their physiological protective role and increase risk of MDR, treatment failure and death among BC patients. Preliminary dataWe explored gene expression profiles of <i>ABCB1<\/i>, <i>ABCC1<\/i> and <i>ABCG2<\/i> in an African ancestry-enriched subset of women with TNBC (ICSBCS cohort: Ghanaian n = 6, African American (AA) n = 9, Ethiopian n = 11). Preliminary data showed significantly higher expression of <i>ABCC1<\/i> among Ghanaian and AA patients compared to Ethiopians, and a significant positive correlation with African ancestry. <i>ABCB1<\/i> and <i>ABCG2<\/i> showed lower expression in all three groups (ns).To study the relationship between ABC transporter gene SNPs and MDR, we have collected data over a 3-year period (2019-2021) from the Oncology Department of the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Ghana. The overall prevalence of BC recurrence was 3.4% (CI = 2.5 - 4.7%), and prevalence of metastatic BC was 47.6% (CI = 44.6 - 50.6%).<br \/>Methodology: SNPs in ABC transporter genes will be obtained from 150 consented female BC patients who have undergone chemotherapy. We will compare genotype frequencies among patients with disease recurrence and\/or metastasis (n = 100) to those with no disease recurrence or metastasis (n = 50). Single-plex genotyping of the ABC gene SNPs will be completed using a real-time PCR allelic discrimination assay.<br \/>Conclusion: <i>ABCC1<\/i> has been established to be associated with African ancestry. Determining the association of ABC gene SNPs and MDR among Ghanaian BC patients will provide further information on allelic variants and their effects on BC treatment outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL14-03 Cytogenetics and clinical molecular genetics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Multidrug resistance,ABC transporters,African Ancestry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Gloria Agyekum Boaitey<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Rachel Martini<sup>2<\/sup>, Melissa  B.

We previously reported that breast cancer cells lacking protein expression of <i>PIK3R1<\/i> had elevated levels of activated MEK, sensitizing them to the MEK inhibitor trametinib. To better understand whether MEK inhibition is a therapeutic option for breast cancer patients with mutated <i>PIK3R1<\/i>, we conducted a pilot study using the newer generation MEK inhibitor, binimetinib, in a PDX mouse model and found that mutations in <i>PIK3R1<\/i> sensitized these PDXs to binimetinib. Alpelisib is FDA-approved for use in breast cancers harboring certain mutations in <i>PIK3CA<\/i>. Since PIK3R1 and PIK3CA form the PI3K complex, we reasoned that alpelisib may also have activity in mutant-<i>PIK3R1<\/i> breast cancers. In this study, we aimed to test binimetinib, alpelisib and the combination in PDX models harboring <i>PIK3R1<\/i> mutations.<br \/>Methods: Three PDX models derived from TNBCs were tested in athymic nude-foxn1nu (Immune-compromised) mice. All PDX models had wild-type <i>PIK3CA<\/i> and <i>PTEN<\/i>. Model 1 was wild type for <i>PIK3R1<\/i>, while Models 2 and 3 harbored <i>PIK3R1<\/i>mutations c.1357_1389del and c.1705_1740del, respectively. PDX models were treated with vehicle control, binimetinib alone (10 mg\/kg BID), alpelisib alone (35 mg\/kg QD), or binimetinib and alpelisib in combination. Animals were treated orally daily for at least 28 days. Tumor volumes and animal weights were measured twice weekly until study endpoint.<br \/>Results: At the time of this publication, Models 1 and 2 had not reached the study endpoint. Final results will be presented at the meeting. Interim ANOVA endpoint analysis revealed no significant differences across treatment arms in Model 1 (wild type <i>PIK3R1<\/i>). However, a significant effect of treatment was observed in Models 2 and 3 (mutant <i>PIK3R1<\/i>; p=0.040 and p=0.00001, respectively). Tukey&#8217;s test revealed that the treatment effect in Model 2 resulted from the vehicle control compared to the combination arm [(binimetinib + alpelisib), p=0.016], while in Model 3, a highly significant effect of treatment was observed between vehicle control and each treatment arm (p&#60;0.000001). Finally, in Model 3, the drug combination significantly decreased tumor growth compared to each agent alone (p=0.033 and p=0.027 for binimetinib and alpelisib, respectively).<br \/>Conclusions: Mutations in <i>PIK3R1<\/i> sensitize TNBCs to MEK inhibitors like binimetinib. In the absence of functional PIK3R1, aberrant PI3K signaling occurs, which explains the sensitivity of breast cancers that are <i>PIK3CA<\/i> wild-type and <i>PIK3R1<\/i> mutant to alpelisib. The combination of both MEK and PIK3CA inhibition appears to be an effective combination therapy in TNBCs harboring mutations in <i>PIK3R1<\/i>.<br \/>AMA is employed by the U.S. FDA, but contributed to this publication in his own capacity.

Signals of occupied and unoccupied PI3K&#945; proteins can be readily measured in cellular and in vivo samples. The assay was utilized in a large panel of cancer cell lines, revealing a direct correlation between target occupancy and pathway inhibition of markers such as phosphoAKT and phosphoS6. Critically, these correlations revealed the need to achieve near complete suppression of PI3K&#945; to enable sustained pathway inhibition and cancer cell death. We furthermore utilized this assay to explore the turnover rate of PI3K&#945; across multiple diverse tumor types, mutations, and tissues.

The presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes has been associated with benefit from therapy. Furthermore, the TME also contains immunosuppressive elements that can impede immune response. Imaging Mass Cytometry&#8482; (IMC&#8482;) enables detailed assessment of cell phenotype and function using 40-plus markers simultaneously at subcellular resolution on a single slide without spectral overlap or background autofluorescence. High-plex IMC has enabled us to evaluate the TME in different cancer histologies including in highly autofluorescent tissue types like lung, hepatocellular carcinoma, and skin melanoma.<br \/>The Maxpar&#174; Human Immuno-Oncology IMC Panel Kit (201508) was customized using antibodies from the Standard BioTools&#8482; catalog to create panels for tissue-based immuno-oncology research. Data acquisition was performed using a Hyperion&#8482; Imaging System. To facilitate cell segmentation, an IMC Cell Segmentation Kit (TIS-00001) was applied to enhance cell membrane boundaries. We applied a pixel classification approach and CellProfiler&#8482; for single-cell segmentation. We used histoCAT&#8482; for single-cell analysis to visualize protein expression in various cancer types via PhenoGraph clustering and t-SNE maps.<br \/>Our panels were applied to normal and cancer human tissue microarrays (TMAs) to phenotype and analyze cell populations in these tissues. We provide detailed analysis of the TME by classifying activation state of immune cell populations, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression, and composition of the extracellular matrix. In-depth single-cell analysis quantitatively evaluated the cellular makeup and immune cell component in the TME of cancer tissues and identified major tumor, immune, and stromal cell phenotypes. This work demonstrates the capability of IMC for quantitative and spatial identification of multiple immune parameters in the TME on a single slide of cancer patient samples (e.g. tumor microarray).<br \/>For Research Use Only.
