[{"Abstract":"Background\/Purpose: CD47 has been validated to be expressed on various tumor types including acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and other hematologic or solid tumors. As primary &#8216;don&#8217;t eat me&#8217; signal, high expression of CD47 on tumor cells interacts with SIRP&#945; negatively regulating the phagocytosis level. However, poor safety profile as well as insufficient combinatory effect remain to be the issues limiting the clinical outcomes of CD47-targeting molecules. Herein, we used rational design strategies to generate SCR9168 with potent affinity improvement, and maintained favorable safety profiles in different animal species, including cynomolgus monkeys.<br \/>Procedures: Mutagenesis was introduced to the residues critical for CD47\/SIRP&#945; binding interface. Affinity was measured by SPR analysis. <i>In vitro<\/i> activities were determined by biochemical- or cell-based binding, blocking and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) assays. The efficacy <i>in vivo<\/i> was assessed with the OE19 xenograft model. Pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety were monitored in both mice and cynomolgus monkeys.<br \/>Results: The affinity of SCR9168 achieves 178 pM for human CD47 which is nearly 50-fold increase in comparison with wild-type SIRP&#945;. Enhanced affinity has also been confirmed in binding to OE19 or DLD1 cell lines, as well as in blocking human SIRP&#945; binding to Raji cells. SCR9168 remains strong binding potency to monkey, mouse or rat CD47 which allows the PK and safety assessment using these animal species. The combined effects of SCR9168 and multiple therapeutic antibodies targeting tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) have been evaluated with ADCP assays using human monocyte-derived macrophages. SCR9168 markedly increases the ratio of phagocytic cells combining with antibodies, such as cetuximab. However, due to the inert function of Fc fragment, no phagocytosis of red blood cells or platelets was caused after the incubation <i>in vitro<\/i>. In addition, SCR9168 treatment in combination with trastuzumab leads to significantly improved suppression of tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, administration of two doses at day 1 and day 11 in cynomolgus monkeys results in no toxicity events related to SCR9168 based on the data from hematological analysis.<br \/>Conclusion: SCR9168 demonstrates the best-in-class potential among SIRP&#945; mutein molecules. It elicits improved and dose-dependent efficacy in phagocytosis or tumor suppression combining with therapeutic antibodies, such as trastuzumab or cetuximab. Favorable safety profile with no phagocytosis of RBC or platelets<i> in vitro<\/i> as well as no hematological toxicity observation in cynomolgus monkeys allows broader dose range exploration in early clinical phase. SCR9168 is currently in development stage and IND enabling will be expected in the end of 2023.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD47,SIRP&#945;,protein engineering,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yingying Hu<sup><\/sup>, Yayuan Fu<sup><\/sup>, Lei Liu<sup><\/sup>, Wenjing Li<sup><\/sup>, Liting Xue<sup><\/sup>, Zhiyong Yu<sup><\/sup>, Yun Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Meijuan Gao<sup><\/sup>, Yixin Tan<sup><\/sup>, Fudong Wang<sup><\/sup>, Yadan Wu<sup><\/sup>, Jie Li<sup><\/sup>, Zhenzhen Li<sup><\/sup>, Feng Zhou<sup><\/sup>, Wenqing Yang<sup><\/sup>, Zhuoxiao Cao<sup><\/sup>, <b>Renhong Tang<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Jiangsu Simcere Pharmaceuticals Co.

Therefore, developing therapeutic strategies reinvigorating immunosuppressive myeloid cell subsets is of raising interest in oncology. We have identified CLEC-1, a member of the C-type lectin receptor (CLR) family as being expressed by myeloid cells, especially by conventional type one dendritic cells (cDC1), and by tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). However, the role of CLEC-1 in myeloid function and its mechanism of action remained to be fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the effect of CLEC-1 blockade, either by genetic deletion or by antibody targeting, on myeloid function and anti-tumor response. First, we observed that CLEC-1 genetic deletion significantly increases the survival of syngeneic tumor-bearing mice in the Hepa1.6 orthotopic model of hepatocarcinoma, as well as in the AK-7 orthotopic model of mesothelioma. Moreover, the synergy with chemotherapy treatment (cyclophosphamide, gemcitabine) in the MC38 model of colon adenocarcinoma in<i> Clec1a<\/i> deficient animals significantly enhanced complete responses. Eventually, cured mice developed a robust memory antitumor immune response against the tumor. Next, we generated anti-human CLEC-1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as well as CLEC-1 humanized mice. We found that CLEC-1 targeting through mAb treatment was able to prolong mouse survival as efficiently as by CLEC-1 genetic deletion in MC38 and Hepa1.6 models. CLEC-1 blockade by genetic deletion or by different mAbs treatment profoundly impacted the tumor microenvironment: we observed an increase in the frequency of invigorated dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, activated and memory T cells, while frequencies of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and PD1-expressing T cells largely decreased. Mechanistically, the <i>in vivo<\/i> phagocytosis of tumor cells (Hepa1.6 and MCA101) by macrophages was enhanced in CLEC-1 deficient animals compared to WT animals. Altogether, our results demonstrate that CLEC-1 acts as a novel immune checkpoint in myeloid cells and highlight its high potential as a target for innovative immunotherapy in oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Macrophages,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Vanessa Gauttier<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ir√®ne Baccelli<sup>1<\/sup>, Marion Drouin<sup>1<\/sup>, Isabelle Girault<sup>1<\/sup>, Sabrina Pengam<sup>1<\/sup>, Emmanuelle Wilhelm<sup>1<\/sup>, Javier Saenz<sup>2<\/sup>, Julien Taurelle<sup>1<\/sup>, Emmanuel M√©rieau<sup>2<\/sup>, B√©rang√®re Evrard<sup>2<\/sup>, Caroline Mary<sup>1<\/sup>, G√©raldine Teppaz<sup>1<\/sup>, Ariane Desselle<sup>1<\/sup>, Virginie Th√©p√©nier<sup>1<\/sup>, Nicolas Poirier<sup>1<\/sup>, Elise Chiffoleau<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>OSE Immunotherapeutics, Nantes, France,<sup>2<\/sup>Nantes Universit√©, CHU Nantes, INSERM, Center for Research in Transplantation and Translational Immunology, UMR 1064, F-44000 Nantes, France, Nantes, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"34f3d039-66d1-43ca-bb74-087208443d77","ControlNumber":"6121","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;V.

Here, we solve the crystal structure of Siglec-15 and delineate its binding epitope by co-crystallization with an anti-Siglec-15 blocking antibody. Saturation transfer-difference (STD) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy assisted with molecular dynamic simulations revealed the binding mode of Siglec-15 to the cancer-associated sialyl-Tn (sTn) glycoform. Binding of Siglec-15 to T cells, which lack sTn expression, depends on the presence of sialic acid. We identified the leukocyte integrin CD11b as a binding partner of Siglec-15 on human T cells. Collectively, these data provide an integrative understanding of the structural features of Siglec-15 and underscore glycosylation as an additional layer of control of T cell responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Siglec-15,Sialic Acid,CD11b,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Maria Pia Lenza<sup>1<\/sup>, Leire Egia-Mendikute<sup>1<\/sup>, Asier Anto√±ana-Vildosola<sup>1<\/sup>, C√°tia O.

Despite continued success of these therapies, some patients experience limited efficacy owing to clinically complex and unresolved mechanisms of primary and acquired immunotherapy resistance. To begin to understand the mechanisms of acquired resistance to anti-PD-1 blockade, we developed a syngeneic murine CT26 colorectal tumor model that is resistant to anti-PD-1 therapy. To achieve this, CT26 tumors were subjected to successive rounds of increasing levels of anti-PD-1 therapy. When tumors grew out, they were cultured in vitro and then re-implanted and re-treated for three rounds until PD-1 resistance was achieved. To characterize the underlying drivers of acquired resistance across the generation of the model, wild type and anti-PD-1 resistant tumors and cultured cell lines were evaluated by flow cytometric immunophenotyping and RNA-sequencing analysis. To assess how observed changes in the tumor microenvironment impact response to various therapeutics, the resistant tumors were treated with anti-PD-1 therapy or SEA-TGT, a nonfucosylated anti-TIGIT mAb with enhanced Fc-function that drives activity through multiple modes of action. As expected, treatment with anti-PD-1 monotherapy was ineffective, however, treatment with SEA-TGT demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity. These data are consistent with responsiveness to anti-TIGIT agents in other in vivo models of PD-1 resistance and\/or PD-1 refractory response, indicating that the factors driving resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy can be different than those driving response to other known checkpoint molecules such as TIGIT. Thus, investigational agents such as SEA-TGT may have the potential to be efficacious in tumors that are primary or secondarily resistant to anti-PD-1 therapy. We have initiated a phase 1 study (NCT04254107) evaluating the safety, tolerability, and activity of SEA-TGT monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with advanced malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TIGIT,Mouse models,Resistance,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>David  R.

Resistance can arise because of somatic mutations in cancer cells that allow evasion of T cell-mediated killing. One commonly acquired resistance mutation in melanoma, loss of beta-2 microglobulin (B2m), prevents T cell killing by hiding cancer cells from CD8+ T cell recognition. To understand the failed immune response against resistant tumors, we used single-cell RNA-seq to characterize tumor-infiltrating immune cells in antigen presentation-deficient human melanoma biopsies and CRISPR-modified mouse melanoma tumors. Our data demonstrate an increase in immunosuppressive M2-like macrophages and absence of CD8+ T cells in B2m-null tumors. To overcome this resistance, we treated tumor-bearing mice with CD40 agonist antibody, which promotes differentiation of macrophages towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype and increases dendritic cell priming of CD8+ T cells. Treatment with CD40 agonist reduced tumor growth and improved tumor clearance in B2m-null melanoma and colorectal cancer models. To determine how CD40 agonist treatment works, we depleted different immune populations from the tumor microenvironment. We hypothesized that by depleting M2 macrophages, CD40 agonist treatment would remove an immunosuppressive brake to allow natural killer (NK) cells to kill tumor cells lacking MHC expression. To our surprise, NK cells were not required for the efficacy of CD40 agonist. Instead CD8+ T cells were required, even though the CD8+ T cells cannot directly recognize the tumor cells. scRNA-seq identified a transcriptionally unique state of CD8+ T cells that is recruited to the tumor microenvironment after CD40 agonist treatment. These CD8+ T cells produce IFN&#947;, which is required for the efficacy of CD40 agonist treatment. These data demonstrate that CD8+ T cells, a key mediator of anti-tumor immunity, can still be recruited to control tumors deficient in antigen presentation. More broadly, they suggest that strategies to activate CD8+ T cells may be effective even in the context of acquired resistance to checkpoint inhibitor therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Resistance,Immune checkpoint blockade,CD40,T lymphocyte,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Brian C.

Indeed, primary tumors regressed in 53% of the CT26 tumor-bearing mice treated with UNO and anti-PD-1. Moreover, these mice were primary and distant tumor-free and survived 100 days post-treatment. In the current study, we assessed PD-L1 expression levels on cancer cells <i>in vitro<\/i> following short-term exposure to UNO.<br \/>Methods: CT26 cells were exposed to 25,000 - 100,000 ppm NO for 10 - 60 seconds. The percentage of PD-L1-expressing cells was assessed by flow cytometry analysis.<br \/>Results: 1. Exposing CT26 cells to 100,000 ppm NO for 10 seconds upregulated PD-L1 expression. 85.1% of cells, which are still viable or at early apoptosis, expressed PD-L1 compared to 71% of untreated cells (p&#60;0.0001). Exposure of CT26 cells to 25,000 ppm or 50,000 ppm NO for 10 seconds did not change the level of PD-L1 expression significantly. 2. Exposure to 100,000 ppm NO for 30 seconds further increased the percentage of cells expressing PD-L1 to 96.7% (p&#60;0.0001 compared to untreated cells). For this duration, lower concentrations of NO also increased PD-L1-expression in viable early apoptotic CT26 cells to 82.8% - 92.3% when treated with 25,000 ppm or 50,000 ppm NO, respectively. 3. Finally, a 60 second exposure of CT26 cells to 25,000 ppm, 50,000 ppm, or 100,000 ppm NO resulted in the highest percentage of PD-L1 expressing cells. Approximately 95% of all viable or early apoptotic CT26 cells express PD-L1 under all NO conditions. This finding is significant compared to 71% of cells in the control arm that express PD-L1 (p&#60;0.0001).<br \/>Conclusion: Short-term exposure (10 - 60 seconds) to UNO upregulates PD-L1 expression on cancer cells in an NO concentration-dependent and exposure-dependent process. A 10-second exposure to 100,000 ppm NO is sufficient to significantly induce PDL-1 expression. Therefore, NO therapy can potentially be combined with anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment to improve therapeutic outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nitric oxide,PD-L1,Cancer immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yana Epshtein<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Matan Goldshtein<sup>1<\/sup>, Selena Chaisson<sup>2<\/sup>, Jedidiah Monson<sup>2<\/sup>, Matt Johnson<sup>2<\/sup>, Amir Avniel<sup>3<\/sup>, Steve Lisi<sup>4<\/sup>, Hila Confino<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Beyond Cancer, Rehovot, Israel,<sup>2<\/sup>Beyond Cancer, Atlanta, GA,<sup>3<\/sup>Beyond Air, Ltd., Rehovot, Israel,<sup>4<\/sup>Beyond Air Inc, Garden City, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e7d399e5-2d2e-4fd1-a6d8-5c2b1b18306e","ControlNumber":"4194","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;Y.

Therefore, understanding the mechanisms regulating the immunosuppressive activity of myeloid cells is of major interest in oncology. We have identified CLEC-1, a member of the C-type lectin receptor (CLR) family, as a myeloid cell-driven brake for anti-tumor T cell response in different murine models, including mesothelioma, hepatocellular and colorectal carcinomas. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the immunomodulatory role of CLEC-1 remained to be fully elucidated. Here, using both murine and human cells, we identified and characterized a novel endogenous ligand for CLEC-1, shedding new light on CLEC-1 driven inhibitory myeloid checkpoint activity. First, using single cell RNA sequencing, we confirmed that CLEC-1 is expressed by human myeloid cells, especially by conventional type-one dendritic cells and by tumor-associated macrophages. Using an Fc-fusion human CLEC-1 protein (huCLEC-1) as a bait for potential endogenous ligands, we observed both in human and murine cells that huCLEC-1 binds specifically to stressed or dying cells following programmed necrosis, for instance after X-ray or chemotherapy treatments. CLEC-1 interaction with its ligand expressed by necrotic cells was able to activate the NFAT promoter in a CLEC-1-CD3zeta NFAT reporter cell line <i>in vitro<\/i>; furthermore, CLEC-1 ligand targeting <i>via<\/i> Fc-CLEC-1 treatment <i>in vivo<\/i> extended the overall survival of chemotherapy-treated mc38-colorectal cancer bearing mice, altogether demonstrating the functional relevance of CLEC-1 interaction with its ligand. Immunoprecipitation of proteins bound to huCLEC-1 subsequently enabled the identification of TRIM21, an intra-cellular Fc receptor and E3 ubiquitin ligase as a novel interaction partner for CLEC-1. Direct interaction between recombinant TRIM21 and CLEC-1 human proteins was subsequently confirmed by ELISA and Biacore affinity analysis. TRIM21 was indeed detected at the cell surface of necrotic cells following genotoxic treatments <i>in vitro<\/i> in several human cancer cell lines and, interestingly, high TRIM21 expression was predictive of worse overall survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, or glioma. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that CLEC-1 genetic deletion in mice enhances the capacity of dendritic cells to cross-present tumor antigens, a process known to be regulated by TRIM21 through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Antagonist anti-CLEC-1 or anti-TRIM21 antibodies are therefore being evaluated to further confirm the involvement of the newly identified CLEC-1 interaction with TRIM21 in the regulation of CLEC-1&#8217;s function as an inhibitory myeloid checkpoint. Altogether our data highlight the CLEC-1\/TRIM21 axis as a new target for cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Irene Baccelli<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Vanessa Gauttier<sup>1<\/sup>, Marion Drouin<sup>1<\/sup>, Caroline Mary<sup>1<\/sup>, Isabelle Girault<sup>1<\/sup>, Emmanuelle Wilhelm<sup>1<\/sup>, Sabrina Pengam<sup>1<\/sup>, G√©raldine Teppaz<sup>1<\/sup>, Julien Taurelle<sup>1<\/sup>, Ariane Desselle<sup>1<\/sup>, Virginie Thepenier<sup>1<\/sup>, Nicolas Poirier<sup>1<\/sup>, Elise Chiffoleau<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>OSE Immunotherapeutics, Nantes, France,<sup>2<\/sup>Nantes Universit√©, CHU Nantes, INSERM, Center for Research in Transplantation and Translational Immunology, UMR 1064, Nantes, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cbc8babb-eed9-4eb4-b7a1-79fea63e69b3","ControlNumber":"6512","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>I.

Nonetheless, a large portion of the population has limited benefit from these ICI treatments due to lack of efficacy, resistance and intolerance. T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing-3 (TIM-3) has been proposed as a target for cancer immunotherapy. It is an inhibitory receptor modulating immune tolerance, and its expression has been broadly reported to be closely correlated to T cell exhaustion and pessimistic prognosis. Besides negatively modulating T cell status, TIM-3 is also expressed on natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages and regulates immune responses bridging innate immunity and adaptive immunity. NB002 is a novel humanized Fc-engineered IgG1&#954; antibody, developed via NeologicsBio&#8217;s integrated target validation &#38; antibody screening Tier-A platform. It has been characterized in a serial of function and efficacy studies and completed IND-enabling preclinical development. NB002 binds to human TIM3 with high affinity in the low nanomolar range and antagonize the TIM-3 pathway effectively in reporter cell and primary cell assays. NB002 increased the secretion of IFN-&#947; by activated PBMC cells and enhanced activation and killing activity of NK cells. Moreover, it exhibited a distinctive activity of restoring myeloid cells and enhancing antigen presentation and processing during anti-tumor immune responses, and superior efficacy in multiple humanized mouse models of cancer as monotherapy regimen. Importantly, X-ray crystallography demonstrated that NB002 recognized a unique epitope on TIM-3 and was confirmed by epitope binning assay and structural alignment. These data could potentially explain novel features of NB002, restoring both acquired and innate immunity which could lead cold tumor to hot tumor.In summary, these data showed that NB002 is a potent anti-TIM-3 antibody with pre-clinical properties. A phase 1 study is planned and patients with advanced metastatic solid tumors will be recruited.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Immunotherapy,Monoclonal antibodies,TIM-3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yu Zhang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jinyu Dong<sup>1<\/sup>, Binbin Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Jie Ni<sup>1<\/sup>, Dong Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Liegang Shao<sup>1<\/sup>, Meiguang Xiong<sup>1<\/sup>, Ting Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Florencia McAllister<sup>2<\/sup>, Xin Dong<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>NeoLogics Bioscience Co.

Despite great strides in the understanding of this disease, survival is still dismal. One of the objectives of our lab is to modulate the tumor microenvironment (TME) towards a proinflammatory phenotype to render these tumors amenable to immunotherapy. TIM-3 is a member of the TIM family of immunoregulatory proteins expressed on multiple immune cell types, including T-cells, NK, myeloid populations, and microglia, regulating adaptive and innate immunity. Therefore, the aim of this project is to study the antitumor effect of the anti-TIM-3 monoclonal antibody and its effect on the DMG tumor microenvironment. Experimental Procedures: TIM-3 expression in DMG patients was analyzed using total mRNA sequencing data and single-cell RNAseq data. To perform all the experiments, DIPG murine cell lines were used (NP53 and XFM). For in vivo experiments, cells were injected into the pons of mice using a screw-guided system. The antibody was administered intracranially (25&#181;g) with the same system and two times intraperitoneally (10mg\/kg) 3, 7, and 11 days after the cell implantation respectively. Tumor immune populations, chemokines, and cytokines were analyzed by flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: In silico assessment of TIM-3 expression in DMG mRNA and single-cell datasets showed a robust expression of this gene mainly in microglia and macrophages uncovering this molecule as a potential target in DMGs. In vivo studies showed that TIM-3 blockade with an antibody significantly increased the overall survival of two DMG immunocompetent orthotopic models, led to long-term survivors (50%), and showed immune memory. TIM-3 inhibition resulted in significant increase in the number and proliferative state of microglia, NK, and CD8+ cells and higher levels of IFN&#947;, GrzB and TNF&#945; corresponding to NK and T-cell activate phenotypes. Interestingly, there was a decrease in the Treg population, which caused an increase in the pro-inflammatory CD8\/Treg ratio. Chemokine studies demonstrated an augmentation of CCL5, CCL2 chemotactic chemokines, and CXCL10, IL-1&#946; and IFN-&#947; pro-inflammatory cytokines in the tumor microenvironment of treated mice. Additionally, DCs, CD4+, and CD8+ cells were increased in treated draining lymph nodes and of functional significance, expressed higher amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines than in control mice. Interestingly, the depletion NK, CD4 and CD8 immune populations did not completely abrogate the treatment efficacy. However, microglia and macrophages depletion with an anti-CSF1R resulted in a total loss of efficacy indicating a critical role of these populations in the effect of TIM-3 blockade.<br \/>Conclusions: These data uncover TIM-3 as a potential target for the treatment of DMG and its role as an immune regulator of the DMG tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,Immunotherapy,Tumor microenvironment,TIM-3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Iker Ausejo-Mauleon<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sara Labiano<sup>1<\/sup>, Virginia Laspidea<sup>1<\/sup>, Daniel de la Nava<sup>1<\/sup>, Oren Becher<sup>2<\/sup>, Mariella G Filbin<sup>3<\/sup>, Fernando Pastor<sup>4<\/sup>, Marta M Alonso<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Pediatrics, Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain,<sup>2<\/sup>Jack Martin Fund Division of Pediatric Hematology-oncology, Mount Sinai, New York, NY,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, MA,<sup>4<\/sup>Molecular Therapeutics Program, Center for Applied Medical Research, Pamplona, Spain","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"10e15d84-9ccd-4c33-b939-a29828e5dab1","ControlNumber":"1594","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>I.

Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), mediated by macrophages and other myeloid cells, is an important mechanism-of-action (MoA) for antibody-based cancer immunotherapies. Therapeutic strategies that enhance ADCP and other macrophage effector functions can augment direct tumor destruction and enable anti-tumor immunity. ADCP is initiated by binding of antibody Fc domains to Fc gamma receptors (FcgRs), and FcgR crosslinking results in signal transduction that drives inflammatory cytokine production and phagocytosis. Simultaneously, macrophage effector functions are regulated by immune checkpoints. Blockade of these immune checkpoints (e.g., SIRPa, ILT4), or agonists of activation pathways (e.g., TLR receptors) can enhance macrophage effector functions. Current assays to measure macrophage function are tedious, low throughput, and highly variable. Here, we present a suite of cell-based luminescent reporter bioassays to measure macrophage effector functions: 1) A monocytic cell background was used to measure ADCP via endogenous expression of multiple FcgRs and integration of a FcgR-activation dependent luminescent reporter. 2) Direct detection of cellular phagocytosis can be measured using the HiBiT split luciferase system. 3) Modulation of macrophage-expressed immune checkpoints can be determined using cell-based reporter bioassays for SIRPa\/CD47 and ILT4\/HLA-G. 4) Activation of TLRs 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 can be measured using a TLR reporter bioassay. These bioassays are robust, easy-to-use, and are pre-qualified according to ICH guidelines. Together, these novel reporter bioassays provide a robust, high-throughput toolbox to facilitate discovery and development of immunotherapies targeting macrophage effector functions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,CD47,Immune checkpoint blockade,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jonathan Mitchell<sup><\/sup>, Julia Gilden<sup><\/sup>, Jim Hartnett<sup><\/sup>, Pete Stecha<sup><\/sup>, <b>Gopal  B.

Nevertheless, a significant proportion of cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint blockades are still largely unsatisfied with the benefits of these drugs. One of the reasons is that cancer cells also use other immune checkpoints such as lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains, and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3. In this study, we screened phage displayed-peptide libraries for peptides that selectively bind to LAG-3. After five rounds of screening, we selected a candidate peptide and named it LAG3Pep. LAG3Pep preferentially bound to human LAG-3-transfected HEK 293T cells over mock-transfected cells and phorbol myristate acetate\/ionomycin\/chloroquine-stimulated Jurkat T cells over unstimulated cells. LAG3Pep also bound to splenocytes isolated from tumor-bearing mice, suggesting the reactivity across human and mouse LAG-3. Pull-down assay of human recombinant LAG-3 protein using biotin-labeled LAG3Pep yielded a protein band of LAG-3. LAG3Pep showed a high-affinity binding to the LAG-3 protein in SPR assays. Pre-treatment of a LAG-3-blocking antibody competed the binding of LAG3Pep to stimulated Jurkat T cells. LAG3Pep inhibited the binding of the LAG-3 protein to THP-1 cells expressing HLA-DR, a well-known LAG-3 ligand. In addition, treatment of T-cells with LAG3Pep in combination with a PD-L1-blocking antibody recovered the secretion of IL-2 by T-cells which was suppressed by FGL-1, another ligand of LAG-3, secreted from HepG2 tumor cells in co-culture. Intravenous administration of LAG3Pep in combination with a PD-L1-blocking peptide showed an anti-tumor growth activity in the MC38 syngeneic mouse colon tumor model. These results show that LAG3Pep acts as LAG-3 blockade and, in combination with a PD-L1-blockade, could be a promising tool for cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Phage display,LAG-3,PD-L1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Seok-Min Lee<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Byungheon Lee<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Kyungpook National Univ.

Among the many molecularly defined IC proteins, some of the most studied ones are CTLA-4 and its binding partners important for early T-cell co-inhibition, along with the PD-1\/PD-L1 axis proteins that carry out late co-inhibitory signals. Notably, in addition to antigen presenting and other immune cells, many tumors also express CTLA-4 and PD-L1, which facilitate tumor evasion from the immune system. The inhibition of these IC proteins has revolutionized the field of cancer therapy, but its efficiency has been limited to a poorly defined subset of patients. Patient outcomes are likely to have a stronger correlation to high levels of PD-1\/PD-L1 interaction and other hallmarks of pathway activation, such as PD-1 phosphorylation and recruitment of SHP-2, than to the overexpression of a single IC protein alone. To improve the predictive value of tissue staining, we created an immuno-oncology line of ultrasensitive kits based on proximity ligation, which detect the activation of multiple ICs. Naveni&#8482; PD1\/PD-L1 is a tool for direct visualization of the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1, and has been verified in various FFPE tumor tissues. Naveni&#8482; pY PD1 sensitively detects PD1 phosphorylation, which is the first step in the PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitory pathway activation. To study the subsequent recruitment of SHP-2 to the activated PD-1 receptor, which is crucial in immune cells but dispensable when the pathway is activated between two tumor cells, one can use the upcoming Naveni&#8482; PD1\/SHP-2 kit. Furthermore, we are developing assays to observe the competing interactions of CTLA-4 and CD28 with their binding partners CD80 and CD86, the interplay of which is pivotal for the initiation of early co-inhibition. All kits can be used on consecutive tissue sections to obtain a comprehensive picture of tumor IC pathway activation, which may not always correspond to CTLA-4, PD-1 or PD-L1 overexpression. While these kits have a chromogenic readout applicable to brightfield microscopy, we also have preliminary data on a PD-1\/PD-L1 assay with a fluorescent readout thanks to which it can also be multiplexed. The multiplex feature generates an immune profile which may help improve immunotherapeutic strategies. The Naveni&#8482; assays can be applied in basic research to elucidate the interplay of IC axes and downstream molecules, in pre-clinical and clinical research to compare stainings with the existing IHC assays and evaluate the potential prognostic value of interaction detection, and in pharma, aiding the development of new drugs or bispecific antibodies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Protein-protein interactions,PD-L1,CTLA-4,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Desir√©e Ed√©n<sup><\/sup>, <b>Ka I Au Ieong<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Naomi Cook<sup><\/sup>, Doroteya Raykova<sup><\/sup>, Agata Zieba Wicher<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Navinci Diagnostics AB, Uppsala, Sweden","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"95765444-85d5-480f-89d7-a956aebee5fe","ControlNumber":"6853","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;D.

PSGL-1 can engage multiple ligands (e.g., selectins, VISTA, Siglec-5, versican, CCL19, and CCL21). Apart from being a key adhesion molecule involved in immune cell trafficking, PSGL-1 has been shown to function as a negative immune checkpoint receptor in both T cells and macrophages. PSGL-1 is highly expressed in tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs) and in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME). PSGL-1 signaling in TILs induces development of T-cell exhaustion and, in TAMs, it promotes immunosuppressive activity of macrophages. In the TME, PSGL-1 is also highly expressed on the surface of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, regulatory T cells, and some types of cancer cells. We hypothesized that PSGL-1 may also act as a ligand to modulate the effector functions of human T cells and macrophages in the TME. In the present study, flow cytometry analysis showed that monocytes and granulocytes had a higher PSGL-1 expression than CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells isolated from normal human blood cells. To mimic the cell-expressing PSGL-1, a recombinant human PSGL-1-Fc protein (rhPSGL-1-Fc, R&#38;D Systems) was coated onto 96-well plates overnight. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), purified human CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, or CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells were cultured in the PSGL-1-coated plates for 3 days in the presence of anti-CD3 antibody. In some experiments, a commercial tool PSGL-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) with the ability to block PSGL-1\/P-selectin interaction was added into the culture system. Cytokine secretion in the culture supernatants was measured using Meso Scale Discovery assays. Similar experiments were also conducted with commercially supplied human M1 and M2 macrophages. The results demonstrated that plate-bound rhPSGL-1-Fc dose-dependently inhibited IFN-&#947;, IL-2, and TNF-&#945; cytokine production in human PBMCs, CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, and in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells following T-cell receptor stimulation. The tool PSGL-1 mAb was able to partially rescue the suppression of cytokine production. Plate-bound rhPSGL-1-Fc also inhibited TNF-&#945; secretion from human M1 macrophage, and the PSGL-1 mAb significantly enhanced TNF-&#945; production in both human M1 and M2 macrophages treated with plate-bound PSGL-1-Fc. Together, these data indicate that PSGL-1 expressed on immune cells in TME may act as both an inhibitory ligand and receptor to impact on T-cell and macrophage function.<br \/>Acknowledgements: Thanks to Patrick Mayes and Ricardo Macarron for scientific input and thanks to Qian Wang Yao and Lynn Leffet for technical assistance.<br \/>Trial Registration: N\/A<br \/>Ethics Approval: N\/A","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,T cell,P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1),cytokine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jun Guan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sundee Dees<sup>2<\/sup>, Tony Chadderton<sup>3<\/sup>, Alejandro Amador Arjona<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Applied Technology Group, Incyte Research Institute, Wilmington, DE,<sup>2<\/sup>Biotherapeutics Research Group, Incyte Research Institute, Wilmington, DE,<sup>3<\/sup>Pharmacology Group, Incyte Research Institute, Wilmington, DE","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a03317de-fe80-4448-a6b2-ae032f0905d7","ControlNumber":"1659","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

Standard of care (surgical resection and platinum-based chemotherapy) has limited survival benefit for patients with advanced disease. Since 3 of every 4 patients are diagnosed with stage III-IV disease, novel therapeutic approaches are needed to improve survival. In trials with PD1\/PD-L1 blockers, patients with OC had modest responses, highlighting an unmet need for effective immunotherapies. Our group has shown the PVRL2-PVRIG node in the DNAM-1 axis suppresses CD8 T cell effector function in syngeneic tumors as well as patient-derived ovarian tumors. This study aims to determine the requirement of tumor- vs myeloid cell-derived PVRL2 for driving immune suppression in OC.Taqman qPCR was conducted for PVRL2, PVR and PD-L1 mRNA expressions of classically activated (M1), and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages from wild-type and PVRL2<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice. In our syngeneic OC model, ID8-Vegf-Defb29 (50,000 cells\/ovary) were surgically implanted in the ovarian bursa and monitored for disease progression. These studies were performed in (1) PVRL2<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice vs. wild type mice and (2) PVRL2<sup>-\/-<\/sup> -&#62; Wild-type vs. wild-type -&#62; wild-type bone marrow chimeras. PVRL2<sup>-\/- <\/sup>ID8-Vegf-Defb29 clones were generated by CRISPR-Cas9, validated for absence of off-target edits by whole exome sequencing and implanted in wild-type and PVRL2<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice. Multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) of PanCK\/CD8-CD68-PVRL2\/PVR was performed on archived HGSOC tissue from patients treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital. CITE-seq was performed on viable TILs from 6 treatment-na&#239;ve and 4 neoadjuvant chemotherapy-treated patients.PVR transcripts were elevated in PVRL2<sup>-\/-<\/sup> M1 (3.77-fold, p=0.04) and M2 (2.61-fold, p=0.003) macrophages compared to wild type. The expression of PD-L1 was increased in M2 macrophages of PVRL2-\/- mice compared to wild-type mice (Mean ratio: 2.28, p=0.04). PVRL2<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice and PVRL2 bone marrow chimeras had significantly improved survival compared to their respective control cohorts. Tumors derived from PVRL2<sup>-\/-<\/sup> ID8-Vegf-Defb29 clones grew slowly in PVRL2<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice compared to wild-type mice. PVRL2 and PVR were highly expressed in human HGSOC, and the prognosis was worse for patients with high PVRL2 expression. In mIF, PVRL2 was expressed not only on tumor cells but also on CD68-positive cells. In CITE-seq, PVRL2 and PVR were strongly expressed in macrophage and dendritic cell clusters.The enhanced expression of PVR and PD-L1 in PVRL2<sup>-\/-<\/sup> M1 and M2 macrophages suggests compensatory activation of co-inhibitory signaling pathways. PVRL2 deficiency selectively in hematopoietically-reconstituted immune cells (primarily myeloid cells) and not in tumor cells conferred a significant survival benefit in our syngeneic OC model. Taken together, blockade of the PVRL2-PVRIG axis in conjunction with PD-1\/L1 inhibition may be an effective modality in OC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kosuke Murakami<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Hirofumi Ando<sup><\/sup>, Michele Doucet<sup><\/sup>, William Huang<sup><\/sup>, Sudipto Ganguly<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>The Bloomberg~Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4776ca80-c3a9-41f3-bb86-c1243fa8fe76","ControlNumber":"6471","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

The outcomes in melanoma patients with LNM can be poor, depending on clinicopathological features including the size and the number of the LNM. Newer immunotherapies including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have significantly improved outcomes in metastatic melanoma patients, and when tumors respond to ICI the durable responses are noteworthy. The aim of the current study is to identify transcriptomics changes in immune-related genes in LNM that correlate to outcomes in melanoma patients receiving adjuvant ICI therapy.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The analysis were performed in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections from LNM positive (LNM(+); n=17) and LNM negative (LNM(-); n=8) of patients who received surgery at SJHC. For each tissue, a single section was processed and analyzed for 2,002 genes using the direct (mRNA extraction-free) transcriptomic assay of the HTG EdgeSeq AutoImmune Panel (HTG-AI). The HTG-AI transcriptomic normalized data were compared between both groups. For verification of gene signatures, publicly available RNA-seq datasets were obtained from patients with clinical outcomes receiving anti-PD-1. All biostatistical analysis were performed using HTG Reveal and\/or GraphPad Prism software.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Comparisons between melanoma LNM(+) and LNM(-) samples showed 229 DEGs (Log2fold-change &#60;-2; &#62;2 FDR&#60;0.01), with 213 genes upregulated and 16 downregulated. Pathway analyses using Reactome indicated that the DEGs in LNM(+) were associated with cytokine, interferon (IFN), and chemokine signaling, as well as signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases (FDR&#60;0.0001). The chemokines <i>CXCL8<\/i>, <i>CXCL2<\/i>, and <i>CXCL10<\/i> were significantly upregulated in LNM(+) (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001). LNM(+) showed significantly higher levels of IFN signaling mediators (<i>STAT1<\/i>, <i>STAT2<\/i>, <i>IFI6<\/i>, <i>IFI30,<\/i> <i>IFI44<\/i>) compared to LNM(-) specimens (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001).

LILRB1 (ILT2) and LILRB2 (ILT4) are ITIM-containing inhibitory receptors that recognize HLA Class 1 and nonclassical ligands (e.g., HLA-A, HLA-G, etc.). LILRB1 is expressed on myeloid cells and subsets of B, NK, and T cells, while LILRB2 expression is mostly restricted to myeloid cells. Interaction of LILRB1 and LILRB2 receptors with HLA ligands promotes an inhibitory milieu that prevents T cells from attacking cancer cells. The distinct pattern of expression and function of these lymphoid and myeloid checkpoints suggests complementary targeting approaches for cancer immunotherapy. Dual blockade of LILRB1 and LILRB2 receptors by a single antibody that restores both innate and adaptive immune responses is a promising strategy to enhance efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors.<br \/>Methods: Dual LILRB1 and LILRB2 targeting antibodies were cloned from B cells derived from rabbits immunized with human LILRB2 recombinant protein, and subsequently humanized. Antibodies were evaluated for binding to human LILRB1 and LILRB2 proteins. Dual targeting antibodies were evaluated in a panel of functional and phenotypic assays. Selected antibodies were further tested for efficacy in a humanized NSG-SGM3 tumor model.<br \/>Results: Dual antibodies were selected based on binding to recombinant human LILRB1 and LILRB2 protein, as well as blocking of HLA-G binding. These antibodies demonstrated binding to cells expressing LILRB1 and LILRB2, with no appreciable binding to other family members. Lead antibodies demonstrated activity in functional cell-based assays modeling LILRB1- or LILRB2-mediated immunosuppression. Dual antibodies also enhanced IFN-&#947; production by LPS-stimulated human PBMC. Selected clones restored T-cell function from M2c macrophage-mediated suppression in coculture with CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell, and enhanced the tumoricidal activity of NK cells. Importantly, the lead antibody demonstrated in vivo efficacy with significant tumor growth inhibition and tumor regression in an SK-MEL-5 tumor model in humanized NSG-SGM3 mice.<br \/>Conclusions: We have identified dual antagonist antibodies targeting both LILRB1 and LILRB2 antibodies that restore both innate and adaptive immune responses. Additionally, dual antibodies restored CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell activation from macrophage-mediated suppression and enhanced NK cell cytotoxic activity. These data provide a strong rationale for further development of dual antibodies as an anti-cancer immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,LILRB,lymphocytes,Tumor associated macrophages,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Meghan Zuck<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Myriam Bouchlaka<sup><\/sup>, Huyen Dinh<sup><\/sup>, Kevin Green<sup><\/sup>, Francisco Zapata<sup><\/sup>, Ramya Chandrasekaran<sup><\/sup>, Tatyana Pisarenko<sup><\/sup>, Lauren Loh<sup><\/sup>, Gajendra S.

Despite the success of Pembrolizumab, Nivolumab and Atezolizumab, the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD1)-programmed death ligand-1\/2 (PD-L1\/L2) pathway remains a tractable target for many drug discovery programs, particularly for bi-specific or combinational therapies. The PD1 - PD-L1\/L2 pathway is important in protecting the host from uncontrolled immune responses, but can be hijacked by tumors, rendering them resistant to immune attack. Antibodies which antagonize this pathway potentiate T-cell mediated tumor destruction yet do not show efficacy in all patients or guarantee long-term protection, in part due to tumor-associated ICI-resistance mechanisms. There is a distinct need to develop novel ICI therapeutics and robust, complex co-culture platforms to better predict clinical efficacy. Here we outline a series of translationally relevant co-culture assays using Pembrolizumab as a benchmark therapeutic alongside other ICI. PD-1 expression levels are known to be low on resting T cells, as indeed are many checkpoint receptors, and so to enhance the therapeutic window, CD3+T cells from healthy human donors were polyclonally stimulated before addition to SK-OV-3 target cell cultures. The SK-OV-3 tumor line was stably transduced with NucLight Red (NLR) to allow co-localization of the caspase 3\/7 signal to tumor cells. Autologous, mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDC), expressing high levels of PD-L1\/PD-L2 were added into tri-cultures in a 2D tumor killing assay. Tumor killing kinetics were quantified via live cell imaging using an Incucyte S3. Although Pembrolizumab enhanced immune-mediated direct (pre-stimulated) T cell killing, the therapeutic window increased in the presence of autologous moDC. Using a modified 3D (tumor spheroid) format over a longer time course, Pembrolizumab was also shown to enhance PBMC-mediated killing and the ability of moDC to enhance this effect further was determined. In recent years, the development and implementation of combinatorial approaches has resulted in significant improvements in patient responsiveness and disease outcomes for various cancers. Here, we describe a suite of tumor killing assays which can be adapted to multiple tumor or therapeutic targets, with a focus on immune involvement. ICI are shown to work robustly and efficacy tracks expression of the relevant checkpoint receptors, making this a powerful format in which to test combination therapies or novel ICI.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Checkpoint Inhibitors,Tumor immunity,T cell,Tumor targeting,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Marie Carkill<sup><\/sup>, Kaitlin Mitchell<sup><\/sup>, Lauren Kelsey<sup><\/sup>, Jezrom Self-Fordham<sup><\/sup>, Nunan Robert<sup><\/sup>, <b>Louise Brackenbury<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Bristol, United Kingdom","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f7867fd2-8767-48fe-b109-c7e9b15e970b","ControlNumber":"6069","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

It is defined by poor effector function, sustained expression of inhibitory receptors, and a transcriptional state distinct from that of functional effector or memory T cells. In this state, cells remain in the local environment but lack effector functions necessary to combat the tumor or infection. In the current study, we developed an <i>in vitro<\/i> human antigen-specific CD8 T cell exhaustion model to evaluate the ability of immune checkpoint inhibitors to restore functionality to exhausted T cells. Using the fully human, autologous MIMIC (<b>M<\/b>odular <b>IM<\/b>mune <b>I<\/b>n vitro <b>C<\/b>onstruct) effector CD8 T cell assay as a framework, we assessed the effect of antigen dose, timing, and frequency of repeated antigen stimulation with antiviral HLA Class I-restricted peptides to drive the development of Ag-specific CD8 T cells toward an exhausted state. Epitope-specific CD8 T cell responses were monitored by HLA class I-restricted pentamers and establishment of an exhausted profile was evaluated by increased expression of inhibitory co-stimulatory receptors and decreased intracellular expression of antiviral effector cytokine via flow cytometry relative to functional Ag-specific CD8 T cells from the same donor. Repeated antigen exposure led to decreased production of IFN-&#947; and TNF-&#945; and increased expression of inhibitory co-stimulation markers on antigen-specific CD8 T cells. After establishment of an exhausted phenotype, treatment with various immune checkpoint inhibitor molecules restored functionality to Ag-specific CD8 T cells upon an additional antigen re-stimulation. Moreover, here using this model we characterized distinct transcriptomic signatures of functional and exhausted MIMIC CD8 T cells. Development of an in vitro human viral antigen-specific CD8 T cell exhaustion model with characteristic features of dysfunctional CD8 T cells as observed <i>in vivo<\/i> and the ability to restore effector function by treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, provides a platform to assess the effectiveness of therapeutic mono-specific or bi-specific &#8220;checkpoint blockade&#8221; antibody candidates and, in general, the potential to evaluate a myriad of immunotherapeutic approaches for cancer treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Exhaustion,Immune checkpoint,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Roberto Carrio<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Margot Cucchetti<sup>2<\/sup>, Mikielia Devonish<sup>1<\/sup>, Louis Poisson<sup>1<\/sup>, Mihaela Babiceanu<sup>1<\/sup>, Andrew Kettring<sup>1<\/sup>, Yingchun Liu<sup>3<\/sup>, Donald Jackson<sup>3<\/sup>, Evan Gomes<sup>1<\/sup>, Jeremy Baudhuin<sup>2<\/sup>, Donald  R.

Cancer immunotherapy targeting immune checkpoint, like programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors has shown treatment efficacy for a broad spectrum of human cancers. Immune checkpoint molecules PD-1 and PD-L1 are expressed on the cell surface of immune cells and tumor cells. Recent studies have also reported these immune checkpoint proteins may undergo alternative splicing or proteolytic cleavage to produce soluble checkpoint proteins. Multiple molecular forms of soluble PD-1 (sPD-1) and PD-L1 (sPD-L1) are detectable in patient sera of multiple types of cancer, and these soluble checkpoint proteins have been reported as putative liquid biopsy biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognosis of oncological disease. Though the clinical significance of circulating soluble immune checkpoint protein profiles as predictive biomarkers has yet to be fully explored and validated, we have committed to develop better and more reliable bioassays to further this research. With that, we have developed 2 Luminex-based multiplex immunoassays for simultaneous quantitation of 48 immune checkpoint proteins, including PD-1 and PD-L1, for patient sera and tumor lysate samples. Here we report the development of 2 novel Single Molecule Counting (SMC) technology-based ultrasensitive single-plex immune checkpoint immunoassays for the detection of sPD-L1 and sPD-1 in human serum and plasma samples. Comparative studies demonstrate these SMC ultrasensitive assays possesses at least 10-100-fold higher sensitivity as compared with the Luminex-based immunoassays. Using these novel ultrasensitive assays, we have validated the detection of significant increases in sPD-L1 and sPD-1 in cancer serum samples as compared with the levels in healthy controls. We have also applied these high sensitivity assays to measure human PD-L1 and PD-1 biomarkers in other sample types including urine, tumor lysates and exosomes. In conclusion, we envision that these PD-1 and PD-L1 SMC assays may overcome a major limitation in biomarker utility and enable the ultrasensitive detection of sPD-1 and sPD-L1 in liquid biopsy and blood biomarker research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Immune checkpoint,PD-1,PD-L1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Laila Faramarzi<sup><\/sup>, <b>Wen-Rong Lie<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Rick Wiese<sup><\/sup>, Jared Fiske<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>MilliporeSigma, St. Louis, MO","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1b45da25-1397-498e-b434-00ba745d7d21","ControlNumber":"7851","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;L.

Immune checkpoint molecules have been found on the cell surface of various tumor cells and immune cells as immune activating or inhibitory receptors and ligands. Recent studies have shown these immune checkpoint proteins can undergo alternative splicing or proteolytic cleavage leading to soluble isoforms. IFN&#947; is a pleiotropic and multifunctional cytokine commonly released by cytotoxic immune cells. IFN&#947; production can be enhanced in response to immunotherapy and further modulates the expression of immune checkpoints in the tumor microenvironment. To better understand the immune checkpoint signatures in tumors, we developed a 28-plex mouse checkpoint protein multiplex immunoassay for quantitative analysis of soluble (secreted) and cellular immune checkpoint proteins. Using this immunoassay, we tested 16 mouse cell lines of tumor (n=13) and normal tissues as control (n=3): 2 melanomas (B16F10, YUMM1.7), 3 mammary carcinoma (4T1, NT5, AT-3), 1 lung carcinoma (LLC), 1 prostate cancer (MycCaP), 1 fibrosarcoma (MCA205), 1 ovarian cancer (ID8), 1 bladder cancer (MB49), 1 glioma (CT-2A), 2 blood cancer (RAW, EL4), 1 dendritic cells (DC2.4), 1 myoblast cells (C2C12), and 1 endothelial cells (bEnd.3). We analyzed changes in immune checkpoint protein expression and secretion in these cell lines cultured in normal conditions or upon exposure to IFN&#947; to reflect an immune inflamed microenvironment. Cells were cultured in 96-well plate, 100 mm, or 150 mm Petri dishes, and treated with either 10 ng\/ml or 100 ng\/mL mouse IFN&#947;. Cell culture supernatants and cell lysates were harvested after 6h, 12h, or 24h incubation with IFN&#947; and processed for multiplex Luminex bead-based immunoassay. The soluble and cellular checkpoint proteins most substantially modulated by IFN&#947; treatment in these cell lines included: CD137, BTLA, HVEM, PD-L1. The tumor-specific signature of cellular and soluble checkpoint proteins and its response to IFN&#947; may have implications in the tumor microenvironment and in the outcome to immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Immunoassay,Tumor microenvironment,Protein profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Wen-Rong Lie<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ryan Bucktrout<sup>2<\/sup>, Sanjukta Chakraborty<sup>2<\/sup>, Andrea Orlando<sup>2<\/sup>, Inna Serganova<sup>2<\/sup>, Christine Kornmeier<sup>1<\/sup>, James Hoberg<sup>1<\/sup>, Roberta Zappasodi<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>MilliporeSigma, St. Louis, MO,<sup>2<\/sup>Joan & Sanford I.

However, the molecular mechanism for the expression of CNTN4 in tumors has yet to be elucidated. So, we investigated whether oncogenic ligands regulate the expression of CNTN4 through <i>CNTN4<\/i> promoter (- 2,000 bp ~ + 100 bp)-based reporter gene assays in HEK293 cells using oncogenic ligands. Here, we identified that WNT5a significantly increased the expression of CNTN4 in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the treatment of the WNT5a ligand in the human colorectal cancer cell line SW480, which expresses CNTN4 at a low level, increased the expression of CNTN4. In addition, CNTN4 expression was decreased when the WNT5a antagonist (Box5, a WNT5a-derived N-butyloxycarbonyl hexapeptide) was treated in the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS expressing CNTN4 endogenously. The changes in the expression of CNTN4 were observed by RT-PCR and FACS. Treatment of the WNT5a ligand or WNT5a antagonist changed the transcriptional expression of CNTN4 in each cell line and affected the cell surface expression of CNTN4. Since WNT5a ultimately increases the activity of transcription factors such as NFATc1 or p65 to increase the transcriptional expression of the target gene, we further investigated the effect of NFATc1 or p65 on the expression of CNTN4. We found that NFATc1 or p65 binds to the promoter of CNTN4 and increases the expression of transcription. Moreover, it was recently reported that anti-PD-1-refractory melanoma exhibits elevated WNT ligand signaling activity, especially upregulated WNT7b and WNT5a in the WNT ligands. Following this background, the expression level of CNTN4 can be increased in the refractory environment to immunotherapy induced by elevated WNT signaling. Therefore, we constructed B16F10 murine melanoma cells overexpressing WNT5a (B16F10\/WNT5a) to assess the anti-tumor efficacy by administering GENA-104A16, the anti-CNTN4 humanized monoclonal antibody, in the syngeneic mice model with increased expression of CNTN4 induced by WNT5a, and <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy by treatment of GENA-104A16 is under assessment in the B16F10\/WNT5a syngeneic mice model. Through the investigation, we expect to support the rationale and strategy for a combination therapy approach of GENA-104A16 for non-responding patients to immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Wnt signaling,Immuno-oncology,Antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Mi Young Cha<sup><\/sup>, <b>Bu-Nam Jeon<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Hyeokgu Kang<sup><\/sup>, Kyung Mi Park<sup><\/sup>, Hansoo Park<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Genome & Company, Sungnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a9ebf9aa-fc6c-43fe-8c58-e38a13ad6f0c","ControlNumber":"1368","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

However, emerging evidence reveals that local DCs within the tumor microenvironment (TME) are tolerized to facilitate immune evasion. Reprogramming of DCs is recognized as a promising strategy for tumor immunotherapy. Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B4 (LILRB4) is an inhibitory receptor belonging to the LILR family which is mainly expressed on normal myeloid cells and myeloid-derived malignant cells. It is upregulated on tolerogenic DCs (tolDCs), which exhibit low expression levels of costimulatory molecules and resistance to DC maturation. Targeting LILRB4 to reprogram tolDCs has been reported to be a promising strategy for cancer treatment. Here we report the preclinical development of an LILRB4 antagonist antibody, ATG-034.<br \/>Method: The protein-based and cell-based binding affinity of ATG-034 were measured using SPR, ELISA and FACS analysis. Fc receptor (FcR) stimulation assay was used to evaluate the ability of ATG-034 to block the interaction of LILRB4 with its ligand fibronectin. ATG-034-mediated enhancement of antigen presentation and co-stimulation ability of DCs was determined by FACS analysis for the change of surface expression of HLA-DR, HLA-ABC, CD86, and CD206. The mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assay was used to assess the immunomodulatory potential of ATG-034. The <i>in vivo<\/i> antitumor efficacy of ATG-034 was evaluated in a radiation therapy-resistant murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) syngeneic model.<br \/>Results: ATG-034 binds to LILRB4 protein with a single-digit nM affinity. It potently reversed the fibronectin-mediated inhibition of FcR-driven TNF-&#945; cytokine production. TolDCs were reprogrammed by ATG-034 to immunogenic DCs with significant upregulation of the expression of HLA-DR, HLA-ABC, CD86 and downregulation of the expression of CD206. Furthermore, ATG-034 remarkably reinvigorated tolDCs for priming T cell activation with noticeable upregulation of the expression of CD25 and the secretion of IFN-&#947;, enhancing antitumor immunity. In addition, 10 mg\/kg ATG-034 significantly inhibited the LLC tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i> with a TGI of 40.28%, while a benchmark antibody only demonstrated a 24.43% TGI.<br \/>Conclusion: Our data show that ATG-034 reprograms tolDC, enhancing anti-tumor immunity, and demonstrates potent <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor efficacy. Therefore, ATG-034 may be a promising strategy for the treatment of cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Dendritic cells,Immune checkpoint blockade,Tumor microenvironment,T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Ao Sun<sup>1<\/sup>, Enlin Zheng<sup>1<\/sup>, Huili Cao<sup>1<\/sup>, Mengshi Cao<sup>2<\/sup>, Suya Bai<sup>2<\/sup>, Peng Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Linjie Tian<sup>3<\/sup>, Jay Mei<sup>1<\/sup>, Bo Shan<sup>4<\/sup>, <b>Bing Hou<\/b><sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Antengene Corporation, Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Antengene (Hangzhou) Biologics, Hangzhou, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Antengene Biotech LLC, Doylestown, PA, China,<sup>4<\/sup>Antengene Corporation, Shaoxing, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ecd1fabc-1d92-4a7c-857a-fa1e211c74eb","ControlNumber":"3275","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;A.
