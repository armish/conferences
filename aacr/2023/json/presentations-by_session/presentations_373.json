[{"Abstract":"Introduction: The chemokine receptor CXCR5 is highly expressed in tumor cells from different lymphoma types and represents a viable drug target for the development of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) to treat patients with lymphoma. &#8239;<br \/>Methods: Immunohistochemistry of human tissues of different lymphoma types were stained using antibodies against human CXCR5, CD20, CD70 and CD79b. Slides were examined by a pathologist and scored for expression. CXCR5 expression on tumor cell lines was analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell surface receptor density was analyzed by Quantibrite &#8482; PE-beads. Evaluation of antibody internalization was performed using the Operetta High Content Imaging System. NOD\/SCID mice were transplanted subcutaneously with lymphoma patient-derived (PDX) tumor specimens and treated with 2mg\/kg or 10mg\/kg VIP924 CXCR5-ADC or isotype control.<br \/>Results: CXCR5 reveals very low to no expression in most tissues except for lymph nodes. Expression of CXCR5 and other B-cell targets like CD19, CD20, CD70 and CD79b was analyzed on patient-derived tumor samples. High expression of CXCR5 was found on na&#239;ve and previously treated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) samples. Based on these results, we developed a CXCR5 targeted ADC with a novel, highly potent kinesin spindle protein inhibitor (KSPi) payload linked via a legumain-cleavable linker (VIP924). To compare the performance of KSPi ADCs, the same effector chemistry was attached to antibodies against other B-cell targets and tested in cytotoxicity assays in various cell lines. CXCR5-targeted ADC demonstrates significantly higher activity compared to the other ADCs tested except for the CD79b ADC with equal potency. VIP924 was then tested in vivo in different PDX tumor mouse models with different levels of CXCR5 expression. In the LY2264 and HBL-1 DLBCL models, we obtained a tumor growth inhibition of 68% and 100% respectively compared to isotype control. The median survival time for the isotype control group was 29 days and median survival time for the mice treated with 10mg\/kg VIP924 could not be determined as all mice survived until the end of the study (Day 37). No effect on body weight or any adverse effects in the VIP924 treated mice were observed.<br \/>Conclusions: CXCR5 is a highly attractive target in hematological malignancies such as DLBCL, MCL, and FL due to high protein expression and almost no expression in healthy tissues. CXCR5-targeting ADC with KSPi payload showed high potency and superiority to other B-cell-targeted ADCs in vitro on a broad range of lymphoma cell lines. VIP924 with a novel legumain-cleavable linker showed activity in in vivo PDX models from lymphoma patients. Due to the high CXCR5 expression found in relapsed DLBCL patients, VIP924 may bring promising new treatment options for previously treated patients with lymphoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,B cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tibor Schomber<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Beatrix Stelte-Ludwig<sup>1<\/sup>, Amy J.

Similarly modified GAGs are also commonly found on the surface of tumor cells, enabling HPV capsids with tumor-selective binding properties. Belzupacap sarotalocan (bel-sar, formerly AU-011), is a virus-like drug conjugate composed of an HPV virus-like particle (VLP) conjugated to a cytotoxic payload (phthalocyanine dye) which upon light activation, causes rapid immunogenic tumor necrosis of bound tumor cells in vivo and has the potential to induce long-term anti-tumor immunity. Bel-sar has been shown to bind to and kill a wide variety of tumor types in preclinical models and is entering a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of early-stage choroidal melanoma. To investigate the precise GAG modifications as well as the overall genetic signature which mediates the binding specificity of bel-sar, a large, multi-tumor type binding screen of bel-sar on 124 cancer cell lines was performed in vitro, where we identified a strong relationship between drug binding and pathways involved in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Additionally, through dose escalation treatments, HeLa subclones were generated which fail to bind and are resistant to the cytotoxic effects of bel-sar. Gene expression profiling and biochemical characterization of these resistant HeLa cell lines demonstrated a strong reduction in the expression of GAGs and a marked down-regulation of TGF-&#946; signaling, ultimately resulting in the induction of a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). Furthermore, gene-gene correlation studies showed that a variety of GAG biosynthesis genes are associated with TGF-&#946; signaling and EMT progression, and that these genes are important determinates of bel-sar binding. Overall, these data suggest that the binding of bel-sar and HPV VLPs is strongly dependent on the expression and modification of GAGs that occurs during the EMT process. As many cancers, especially metastatic tumors, are thought to undergo at least partial EMT, these data provide mechanistic insights into the tumor-targeting ability of HPV VLP-conjugates such as bel-sar and suggest possible applications for such therapies across a wide variety of other tumor types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-07 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Novel anticancer agents,Gene expression analysis,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Human papillomavirus (HPV),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nathan  R.

We have created and characterized antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) based on a humanized CLEC12A specific antibody to determine whether CLEC12A may be exploited as a therapeutic target for AML. The payload is a proprietary PBD prodrug with a beta-glucuronide trigger, and the linker-payload was conjugated through farnesyltransferase-mediated functionalization. The ADC demonstrated sub-nM cytotoxicity in vitro against several CLEC12A-positive cell lines including HL-60 and PL21. Leu234Ala\/Leu235Ala (LALA) mutations were employed to reduce Fc gamma receptor binding and to avoid on-target toxicity. The LALA mutation-bearing ADC displayed a nearly 50-fold decrease in cytotoxicity towards CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. Its potency was reduced but still sufficient with IC50 values of 61 pM and 15 pM against HL60 and PL21, respectively. Regardless of LALA mutation, the ADCs demonstrated potent antitumor activities with a complete regression at a dose of 0.5 mpk against a subcutaneous HL-60 SCID mouse xenograft model. When the LALA-mutated ADC was tested against a disseminated NSGA mouse model of HL-60-luc, all treated animals survived without clinical symptoms for three weeks after treatment, whereas vehicle-treated animals exhibited morbidity 19 days after treatment or 35 days after tumor implantation. The bone marrow of ADC-treated animals appeared to have nearly fully recovered, whereas that of vehicle-treated animals showed necrosis or tumor growth. In cynomolgus monkeys, the LALA-mutated ADC had a half-life of 82 hours at a dose of 0.2 mpk, and target-mediated drug disposition appeared weak or negligible. Our preclinical studies have shown that CLEC12A targeting ADC can be used as a therapeutics for treating AML.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Acute myeloid leukemia,Targeted therapy,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jinwon Jung<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Juhee Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Bora Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Jung A Kwon<sup>1<\/sup>, Suyoun Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Byeongmin Yoo<sup>1<\/sup>, Minji Ko<sup>1<\/sup>, Ilhwan Ryu<sup>1<\/sup>, Donghoon Yeom<sup>1<\/sup>, Kyoungjae Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Jaehyun Eom<sup>1<\/sup>, Hanbyul Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Jinhyung Ahn<sup>1<\/sup>, Eunsil Sung<sup>1<\/sup>, Weonkyoo You<sup>1<\/sup>, Sang Hoon Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Myeong Joo Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Keon Woo Kwon<sup>2<\/sup>, Hyun Joo Bae<sup>2<\/sup>, Yun-Hee Park<sup>2<\/sup>, Ho Young Song<sup>2<\/sup>, Chul-Woong Chung<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>ABL Bio, Inc., Sungnam-si, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>LegoChem Bioscience, Inc., Daejeon, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bba409f3-6ee4-4141-b92b-27ad2cd79a5c","ControlNumber":"4190","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

ICAM&#8209;1 is involved in many key processes such as cell-cell interactions, signal transduction and leukocytes trans-endothelial migration. ICAM&#8209;1 is constitutively present at low levels on healthy tissues but highly expressed in some lymphoma, myeloma and some types of solid tumors including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancers and liver cancers. Previous attempt to target ICAM&#8209;1 with a monoclonal antibody bersanlimab (BI505, BioInvent) showed that it was well-tolerated but with limited clinical efficacy. To improve the effectiveness of targeting ICAM&#8209;1, we developed a novel ICAM&#8209;1 antibody drug conjugate (ADC). The ICAM&#8209;1 ADC is comprised of a humanized anti-ICAM&#8209;1 hIgG1 antibody conjugated to a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor through a cleavable linker at a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of about 8. The antibody moiety of the ADC targets a unique epitope on ICAM&#8209;1 which is far from its ligand binding domain. Potent <i>in vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity of ICAM&#8209;1 ADC, with nanomolar to sub-nanomolar EC50, was observed on a panel of hematologic and solid tumor cell lines. In preclinical studies, one or two doses of ICAM&#8209;1 ADC at 5-6 mg\/kg were generally sufficient to induce tumor regression in multiple cell line-derived xenograft models, including those of lung and liver cancers. In all models tested so far, the novel topoisomerase I inhibitor conjugated ICAM&#8209;1 ADC is at least as efficacious as the same ICAM&#8209;1 antibody conjugated to the benchmark topoisomerase I inhibitor linker payload deruxtecan (ICAM&#8209;1-DXd). Furthermore, in a repeat dose exploratory non-human primate safety study, the benchmark conjugate ICAM&#8209;1&#8209;DXd (DAR 8) was well-tolerated at 41 mg\/kg, the highest dose tested. In conclusion, ICAM&#8209;1 is an attractive target for topoisomerase I inhibitor based ADC and warrants further investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Topoisomerase I inhibitor,Targeted therapy,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Oi Kwan Wong<\/b><sup><\/sup>, David Jackson<sup><\/sup>, Lei Shi<sup><\/sup>, Qi Fei<sup><\/sup>, Xiaocheng Chen<sup><\/sup>, Leonard Post<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Virtuoso Therapeutics, Inc., San Mateo, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"34e10cf3-3dd3-4f25-a5fe-391baf6428d8","ControlNumber":"2118","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;O.

Despite this momentum and major advances in payload and linker technology, ADCs are limited by off-cancer target-mediated toxicities incurred by currently available targets. In contrast to genomic and proteomic strategies, our unique drug discovery approach accounts for a disease&#8217;s native context. This led to the identification of cancer-specific plectin (CSP) as not only overexpressed in malignant tissue compared to healthy, but exclusively present on the surface of cancer cells and absent in normal or pre-malignant tissue. A Phase 0 imaging trial (Biodistribution of Novel Imaging for Resectable Pancreatic Cancer - NCT01962909) evaluating a radiolabeled CSP-targeted peptide has revealed that CSP is bioavailable and abundant, with over a million CSP molecules per cancer cell in pancreatic cancer. Previously, we generated ZB131, a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets CSP. ZB131 demonstrated potent monotherapy efficacy in pancreatic, ovarian, and bile duct preclinical cancer models, indications that have high CSP expression and are being evaluated in a first-in-human Phase 1\/2 clinical trial (NCT05074472). Here, we show that CSP is an ideal target for an ADC: it is abundantly and selectively expressed in many indications, bioavailable, and its inhibition is predicted to synergize with FDA-approved payloads. ZB131 binds specifically to CSP, rapidly internalizes, displays linear pharmacokinetics in pre-clinical models, and demonstrates a strong safety profile. We describe the development of two ZB131 ADCs, ZB131-MMAE (monomethyl auristatin E) and ZB131-DXd (Deruxtecan), with drug-to-antibody ratios of 3 &#8211; 4 and 7 &#8211; 8, respectively. After binding, both ADCs are rapidly and specifically internalized by CSP-positive cells resulting in drug payload release and enhancing cancer cell death compared to ZB131 alone. Moreover, we characterize cytotoxic activity in high and low CSP cell lines to evaluate ADC activity in relation to CSP abundance. In preclinical xenograft models, ZB131-ADC enhanced tumor regression compared to controls at clinically relevant doses. Furthermore, anti-huIgG staining revealed selective target engagement by ZB131-ADC. Taken together, these data show that ZB131-ADCs demonstrate potent antitumor activity and support their evaluation in a Phase 1 clinical trial.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Cancer cell death,Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE),Deruxtecan (DXd),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Samantha  M.

Unlike in normal tissue, CLDN18.2 is exposed on epithelial surfaces in malignancy. There are no approved targeted therapies for CLDN18.2-expressing cancers. An antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting CLDN18.2 with a monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) payload site-specifically conjugated via a cleavable linker at a drug-antibody ratio (DAR) of 2, EO-3021\/SYSA1801, was developed to target CLDN18.2-expressing cancer cells, minimize toxicities and maximize therapeutic index.<br \/>Methods: HEK293-CLDN18.2 cells were used to evaluate CLDN18.2-dependent EO-3021 endocytosis, MMAE payload release, inhibition of proliferation and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Cell cycle distribution and caspase-3\/7 activity were measured 24 hours after treating BxPC3-CLDN18.2 pancreatic cells with EO-3021 or the unconjugated antibody, EO-3021 mAb. Inhibition of proliferation by EO-3021 was measured on cell lines ectopically expressing medium to high CLDN18.2 and on cell lines with endogenous low to medium CLDN18.2 expression. Xenograft studies evaluating tumor growth inhibition by EO-3021, EO3021 mAb, and cisplatin or gemcitabine were done in gastric (NUGC4; NUGC4-CLDN18.2), pancreatic (Patu8988S; BxPC3-CLDN18.2), and lung (NCI-H460) cancer models.<br \/>Results: EO-3021 binding to cancer cells, endocytosis, MMAE release, and inhibition of proliferation were dependent on CLDN18.2 expression. EO-3021 (EC<sub>50<\/sub>: 172 ng\/ml) and EO-3021 mAb (EC<sub>50<\/sub>: 130 ng\/ml) demonstrated similar levels of ADCC. EO-3021 but not EO-3021 mAb promoted G2\/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and exhibited potent activity across cell lines with low, medium, and high CLDN18.2 expression (IC<sub>50<\/sub>: 7-456 ng\/mL). EO-3021 induced tumor regressions with a single dose across low, medium, and high CLDN18.2-expressing in vivo models derived from pancreatic (2-10 mg\/kg), gastric (0.5-10 mg\/kg), and lung cancers (4 mg\/kg), respectively. In contrast, standard of care (SOC) chemotherapies and EO-3021 mAb did not induce tumor regressions across in vivo models.<br \/>Conclusions: EO-3021 demonstrated profound <i>in vivo <\/i>antitumor activity and outperformed SOC in gastric, pancreatic, and lung cancer models.

New treatment paradigms for relapsed-refractory patients are needed. Most DLBCL tumors are reliant on signaling through their cell surface B-cell receptor (BCR) mediated by ITAMs on CD79A and CD79B to drive anti-apoptotic NF-kB and PI3 kinase signaling. In order to understand how surface BCR is regulated, we performed whole genome CRISPR screens in 9 DLBCL cell lines in which we sorted for high and low surface CD79B or added the CD79B targeted antibody-drug conjugate Polatuzumab-Vedotin (POLA-V). Strikingly, independent of genetic or cell of origin subtype, sgRNAs encoding the entire N-linked glycosylation pathway and specific sugar modification by addition of galactose and sialic acid were found to be enriched in high CD79B fractions and depleted in POLA-V treated samples compared to control. Further testing showed that removing sialic acid by treating with a small molecule inhibitor of sialic acid, genetic perturbation of golgi sugar transporters SLC35A1 and SLC35A2, or the a2,6 sialyltransferase ST6GAL1 resulted in more surface CD79B antibody binding with no significant change in CD79B protein abundance. The specificity of the effect of sialic acid loss on POLA antibody binding was confirmed by removing cell surface sialic acid with exogenous sialidase and observing increased binding of POLA, but not other therapeutic antibodies like Rituximab or CD19 FMC-63. Loss of SLC35A1, SLC35A2, and ST6GAL1 synergized with POLA-V but not the drug conjugate MMAE alone, showing a BCR dependent mechanism of sialic acid loss on POLA-V sensitization. In a further cell of origin subtype analysis of the germinal center B-cell (GCB) DLBCL cell lines, loss of the E3 ligase KLHL6 was found to synergize with POLA-V. Importantly, KLHL6 is heavily mutated across all germinal center derived malignancies, is more highly expressed in germinal center B-cells than other members of the B-cell lineage, and plays an unknown role in the development of autoimmune diseases. Further work will give evidence for the target of KLHL6 mediated ubiquitination and will show how this gene can drive lymphoma and autoimmune disease development in the germinal center.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-07 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),B cells,Glycosylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sean R.

CLDN18.2 is a transmembrane adhesion protein undetectable in most healthy adult tissues but highly expressed in gastric, pancreatic, esophageal, and lung cancers. GPRC5D is a G protein-coupled receptor that is absent from most healthy tissues except for hair follicles but expressed on multiple myeloma cells. Both CLND18.2 and GPRC5D are novel oncology targets with no clinically approved therapies against them. Using our discovery platform tailored to complex transmembrane proteins, we have developed bispecific antibodies with the ability to potently kill CLDN18.2-positive or GPRC5D-positive cells. Multipass membrane proteins are valuable therapeutic targets in oncology and other disease areas but are largely inaccessible as antibody targets due to their poor expression, membrane-dependent structure, small extracellular regions, and poor immunogenicity due to sequence conservation. We developed an antibody discovery platform (MPS) that specifically addresses each of these challenges. This platform utilizes advanced immunization techniques including DNA, mRNA, and Lipoparticles (virus-like particles). It also employs chickens as an evolutionarily divergent host species for robust immune responses against conserved targets. Antibodies raised in chickens are directly humanized prior to isolation, reducing the need for downstream engineering. In two separate campaigns, we immunized chickens with CLDN18.2 and GPRC5D and obtained high-titer immune responses. We were successful in isolating high-affinity antibodies specific to each of these targets. Our CLDN18.2 antibodies showed specificity for their target and did not bind the closely related splice variant CLND18.1, which is highly expressed in healthy lung tissue. Additionally, the antibodies showed no binding to ~6,000 other proteins that were screened using a Membrane Proteome Array. A subset of antibodies from both discovery programs were configured as bispecific molecules using a CD3-targeting arm to bring tumor cells into close proximity with cytotoxic T cells that mediate cell killing. The panels of molecules encompassed multiple bispecific formats bearing different stoichiometries, geometries, and sizes to enable identification of lead molecules with favorable activities and safety profiles. Both CLDN18.2 and GPRC5D bispecifics showed potent T cell-mediated cytotoxicity with picomolar potency. They also showed good cytokine release and developability profiles. GPRC5D x CD3 and CLDN18.2 x CD3 bispecifics hold promise as potent and safe therapeutics for different cancer types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,T cell engager,Therapeutics,Tight junctions,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ileine Sanchez<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Hayley Roth<sup><\/sup>, Brad Screnci<sup><\/sup>, David Tucker<sup><\/sup>, Nick Molino<sup><\/sup>, Trevor Barnes<sup><\/sup>, Paige Murphy<sup><\/sup>, Kyle Guldner<sup><\/sup>, Tim Phillips<sup><\/sup>, Kristen Shema<sup><\/sup>, Thomas Charpentier<sup><\/sup>, Alyssa Cunningham<sup><\/sup>, Janae Latta<sup><\/sup>, Breanna Tyrell<sup><\/sup>, Meghan Pitts<sup><\/sup>, Carmen Navia<sup><\/sup>, Charles Azuelos<sup><\/sup>, Anna Lobley<sup><\/sup>, Jawhara Karam<sup><\/sup>, Valerie Fiers<sup><\/sup>, Daniela Reyes<sup><\/sup>, Kate Slovik<sup><\/sup>, Alison Snyder<sup><\/sup>, Marianne Assogba<sup><\/sup>, Kai-Ti Chang<sup><\/sup>, Riley Payne<sup><\/sup>, Kyle Doolan<sup><\/sup>, Ross Chambers<sup><\/sup>, Joe Rucker<sup><\/sup>, Benjamin Doranz<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Integral Molecular, Philadelphia, PA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a9559813-f0f2-43a2-9ec6-7f5cfb02890e","ControlNumber":"3907","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>I.

Yet, in solid tumor therapies, effort for further improvement of efficacy and safety has been hindered by the poor tumor penetration of conventional IgG based ADC, low internalization efficiency, undesired efflux of ADC from tumor cells, narrow therapeutic window due to the on-target\/off tumor and Fc induced toxicity, etc. To address those issues, we previously reported that the compound JY201, a Polyethylene Glycol (PEG)-based bispecific ADC (P-BsADC) targeting two epitopes of Her2, demonstrated advantages in tumor penetration, internalization efficiency, lysosome trafficking, no Fc related toxicity, and better efficacy in tumor inhibition than transtuzumab deruxtecan (Ds-8201). In this study, we reveal another novel pegylated P-BsADC (JY207) formed by site-specific conjugation of a bispecific single chain fusion protein targeting PD-L1 and CD47 with PEG-MMAE (a pegylated cytotoxic payload MMAE). As expected, the compound JY207 retains all the advantages that JY201 possesses. Furthermore, JY207 does not bind to human red blood cells, but preferentially binds to CD47\/PD-L1 double positive tumor cells, thus reduces the possibility of on-target toxicities. In vitro cytotoxicity studies showed that JY207 has strong potencies in CD47\/PD-L1 double positive tumor cells, while showing almost no killing effect to CD47 or PD-L1 single positive tumor cells. In CDX models and a PDX model of transplanted tumor tissues from lung cancer patients, the compound demonstrated excellent tumor inhibition at low doses. In an in vitro plasma stability test, JY207 displays high stability in cynomolgus monkey and human serums. Preliminary repeated-dosing toxicological study has found the maximum tolerated dose of JY207 in CD47\/PD-L1 double transgenic mice is 50mg\/kg. In vivo pharmacokinetics and toxicological studies of JY207 are being conducted in cynomolgus monkeys and are expected to show desirable results. All those findings in this study warrant JY207 as a promising candidate for the clinical development for patients with CD47\/PD-L1 double positive cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-07 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Bispecific antibody,CD47 x PD-L1,pegylated,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shumin Liu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Weidong Lyu<sup><\/sup>, Shuqiang Yin<sup><\/sup>, Yang Lei<sup><\/sup>, Qiudong Zhuo<sup><\/sup>, Liling Zheng<sup><\/sup>, Bin Sun<sup><\/sup>, Shuangyu Tan<sup><\/sup>, Lidong Jiang<sup><\/sup>, Teng Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Bo Gao<sup><\/sup>, Rui Xu<sup><\/sup>, Dechang Huang<sup><\/sup>, Yong Li<sup><\/sup>, Zibin Wu<sup><\/sup>, David Wu<sup><\/sup>, Yvonne (Yu) Wen<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Shenzhen Enduring Biotech, Ltd., Shenzhen, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"99c65e41-2eef-4dec-a843-8aa0511a1be4","ControlNumber":"4003","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

However, prolonged systemic glucocorticoid treatment results in glucocorticoid-associated adverse events and acquired resistance that limit its therapeutic potential. ABBV-319 is a novel CD19-targeting ADC engineered to reduce glucocorticoid-associated toxicity observed with systemic glucocorticoids while possessing three distinct mechanisms of action (MoA) to increase efficacy: 1) antibody-mediated delivery of GRM to activate glucocorticoid receptor (GR) induced cell death in cancer cells, 2) inhibition of CD19 signaling, and 3) enhanced Fc-mediated cancer cell killing via afucosylation of the antibody backbone.<br \/>Results: We identified a GRM agonist that is 15 and 150 times more potent at driving GR transcriptional activation and cell death compared to clinical glucocorticoids dexamethasone and prednisolone, respectively. The conjugation of GRM agonist as the payload on ABBV-319 enables potent GRM-driven anti-cancer activity against malignant B-cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i> as well as in cell-line and patient derived xenograft (CDX and PDX) models <i>in vivo<\/i>. Remarkably, a single-dose of ABBV-319 induced sustained tumor regression and enhanced anti-tumor activity compared to repeat dosing of systemic glucocorticoids (<i>e.g., <\/i>prednisolone) at its maximum tolerated dose in mice<i>.<\/i> The CD19 monoclonal antibody (mAb) also reduced proliferation of a subset of B-cell malignant cell lines through inhibition of the PI3K\/AKT pathway. Moreover, afucosylation of the CD19 mAb in ABBV-319 enhanced Fc-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and this activity was maintained after conjugation with GRM payloads. ABBV-319 bound similarly to both V158 (high-affinity) and F158 (low-affinity) Fc&#947;RIIIa allotypes and mediated potent ADCC in co-culture assays with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Notably, ABBV-319 displayed superior efficacy compared to afucosylated CD19 mAb in human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell-engrafted NSG-Tg(Hu-IL15) mice, demonstrating that the three MoA (GR-driven cell death, CD19 signaling inhibition, and ADCC) collectively contribute to anti-tumor activity <i>in vivo<\/i>. ABBV-319 also displayed on-target depletion of normal human B-cells but did not affect peripheral NK cell counts in mice. Furthermore, CITE-seq profiling revealed that ABBV-319 treatment of human PBMCs activated GRM-induced signature genes restricted to B-cells, demonstrating the specificity of CD19-mediated delivery of GRM.<br \/>Conclusion: ABBV-319 has potent anti-tumor activity from three distinct MoA and exhibits safety improvements compared to systemic glucocorticoids, supporting its recent progression into Phase I clinical trial.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-07 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD19,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Glucocorticoid,B cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chewei Anderson Chang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ethan Emberley<sup>1<\/sup>, Aloma L.

Evidence indicates that EGFR is involved in the pathogenesis and progression of human carcinoma of different types. HER3 is a unique pseudokinase receptor of the ErbB family and known to mediate resistance to EGFR-targeting therapies. Therefore, we created SI-B001, an EGFR&#215;HER3 bispecific antibody, which can bind EGFR&#215;EGFR homodimers and EGFR&#215;HER3 heterodimer to block their downstream pathways. We performed non-clinical studies to investigate <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor effects.<b><\/b><br \/><i> In vitro<\/i>, the inhibition of tumor cell growth by SI-B001 was stronger than cetuximab and duligotuzumab in FaDu (mRNA expression levels of <i>EGFR<sup>high<\/sup><\/i>\/<i>HER3<sup>high<\/sup><\/i>\/<i>NRG1<sup>medium<\/sup><\/i>). Importantly, testing with the cell line Oka-c-1 (mRNA expression levels of <i>EGFR<sup>high<\/sup><\/i>\/<i>HER3<sup>high<\/sup><\/i>\/<i>NRG1<sup>low<\/sup><\/i>), showed that NRG1 supplementation did not change the potency of cetuximab. However, SI-B001 showed much stronger potency than cetuximab and duligotuzumab under conditions of NRG1 supplementation. This result indicates that the functionality of the bi-specific SI-B001 is competitive against a HER3 natural ligand and capable to act against cancer with HER3 ligand mediated resistance to cetuximab.<br \/><i> In vivo<\/i>, single agent SI-B001 exhibited superior anti-tumor activity to cetuximab in the FaDu xenograft model. Meanwhile, SI-B001 in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin led to a significant synergistic antitumor effect, which was stronger than the combination of cetuximab + paclitaxel + carboplatin. Compared to chemotherapy alone in this model, which could result in weight loss and treatment related mortality, no serious weight loss or deaths occurred in the single agent SI-B001 and the combination of SI-B001 with chemotherapy.<br \/>These results suggest that SI-B001 alone and in combination with chemotherapy can exhibit favorable safety and robust anti-tumor activity. Currently, 6 phase II clinical trials of SI-B001, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, have been conducted in different epithelial carcinomas. These studies have shown a potential break-through activity in NSCLC and HNSCC with a very good safety profile.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,EGFR,Chemotherapy,Xenografts,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Blair Renshaw<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Jahan Salar Khalili<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sa Xiao<sup>2<\/sup>, Yi Zhu<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>SystImmune Inc., Redmond, WA,<sup>2<\/sup>Sichuan Baili Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Chengdu, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4388ddfb-b6a7-478b-811a-962c1300bddc","ControlNumber":"3363","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;B.

We discovered that Trop-2 cleavage by ADAM10 is an activator switch of cancer growth and metastatic diffusion (2) and exposes novel target epitopes that are inaccessible in the unprocessed wtTrop-2. The Hu2G10 mAb selectively binds these epitopes with an affinity that is &#8776;10,000-fold higher than for the unprocessed molecule. To validate a reliable model for Hu2G10 binding <i>in vivo,<\/i> we explored Trop-2 phylogenetic conservation in primates. <i>Pan troglodites<\/i> (chimpanzee), <i>Papio anubis<\/i> (baboon), <i>Macaca mulatta\/fascicularis<\/i> (Rhesus\/Cynomolgous), <i>Callithrix jaccus<\/i> (marmoset) <i>TROP2\/TACSTD2<\/i> sequences were compared. The only difference between <i>Pan troglodytes<\/i> and human Trop-2 is one additional leucine in the Pan leader peptide, making the mature Trop-2 identical to that in man. The <i>Macaca mulatta\/fascicularis<\/i> Trop-2 sequences are 97% identical, 100% similar to the human sequence. Three-dimensional modeling revealed polymorphic residues usage versus activation-driven structural rearrangement of Trop-2. COS-7 and HEK-293 cells transfected with individual primate Trop-2 showed efficient recognition by Hu2G10 in all tested species. Immunohistochemistry analysis of normal Macaca tissues showed Trop-2 expression patterns essentially corresponding to the human ones. IV injected Hu2G10 at doses of 5 to 10 mg\/kg was well tolerated by Cynomolgous monkeys. No neurological, respiratory, digestive and urinary adverse effects were observed, and no body-weight loss occurred during the 28-day observation. No alterations of blood monocyte, neutrophil and basophil counts nor significant changes in biochemical parameters were detected. A pharmacokinetic (PK), study was carried out. Serum concentration of Hu2G10 was determined using anti-idiotypic antibody-based ELISA assays. At the higher dosing of 10 mg\/kg Hu2G10 serum values reached a peak 2-hour after the injection (13281&#177;4686 ng\/ml). The concentration of Hu2G10 then diminished gradually, and reached baseline levels on day 21. The serum concentration peak of 5 mg\/kg Hu2G10 was 5759&#177;1729 ng\/ml, and reached baseline levels on day 14. Thus, Hu2G10 is stable in plasma, and is detectable in the circulation up to three weeks after the infusion (t<sub>1\/2<\/sub>=6.5 days). Taken together, these findings validate primate models as reliable for assessing Hu2G10 <i>in vivo <\/i> toxicity and PK. The lack of toxicity and favorable PK parameters candidate the cancer specific Hu2G10 as first-in-class anti-Trop-2 mAb.

While approval of several ADCs has proven this to be a successful therapeutic approach, there remain opportunities to generate optimized ADCs with tailored selection of antigen matched with payload highly active in the target indication. To this end, ABBV-400 has been developed as an ADC that targets c-Met and topoisomerase-1 (Top1), both of which are overexpressed in solid tumors. The antibody is directed to the cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor, c-Met, a key driver of tumor cell growth and development of resistance to EGFR-targeted and other targeted therapeutics. Supporting this, Teliso-V, a c-Met-targeted ADC with MMAE payload, has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To extend activity of a c-Met-targeted ADC to patients with tumors expressing lower c-Met levels and to indications, such as colorectal cancer (CRC), where MMAE-based ADCs have not been effective, a novel topoisomerase-1 inhibitor linker-drug was developed. Screening over 400 linker-drugs identified a unique, potent Top1 inhibitor with a cleavable valine-alanine linker and stable bromoacetamide attachment designed to minimize systemic payload release. Preclinically ABBV-400 exhibits favorable pharmacokinetics, anti-proliferative activity in vitro, and compelling efficacy in NSCLC, gastroesophageal, and CRC xenograft models. Furthermore, ABBV-400 is well tolerated by cynomolgus monkeys with bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract toxicities common to other Top1 inhibitors. This pairing of a novel linker-drug and an antibody with demonstrated clinical activity provides an exciting opportunity to treat patients with c-Met expression in indications sensitive to Top1 inhibition. ABBV-400 has progressed through dose escalation, and dose expansion is currently ongoing in a Phase 1 FIH clinical study (NCT05029882).<br \/>All authors were employees of AbbVie during this research.

In this view heparin analogues have been tested for their effectiveness not only in cancer associated thromboembolism but also for their potential effects on cancer growth and metastasis. Despite a number of promising preclinical results and clinical hypothesis, many different clinical trials on the use of heparin analogues in different cancers reported no significant benefits in tumor progression and overall survival, indicating that using heparin as a soluble decoy for the many HSPG ligands does not appear to be the best possible approach (1,2). Taking advantage of the tetra-branched peptide NT4, which is a specific ligand of HSPG sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains (3, 4), we tested the effectiveness of targeting cell membrane HSPG, as a potential alternative approach for interfering with HSPG functions in cancer cell invasiveness. We had demonstrated that NT4 can either inhibit or increase oriented migration in respectively PANC-1 pancreas adenocarcinoma and TE671 rhabdomyosarcoma human cancer cells, indicating a crucial but diverse role of HSPGs in oriented cell migration in different cancer cells.NT4 and heparin were here compared for their effect on adhesion and migration of different cancer cell lines on extracellular matrix (ECM) supports, as well as for their effect on proliferation and in vitro invasiveness of the same cell lines. We found that inhibition of cancer cells adhesion to ECM proteins by NT4 varies in different cancer cell lines, ranging from 90% inhibition to as low as 20%, whereas heparin has no effect. Analogous results were obtained when testing cancer cell migration. NT4 inhibited migration and in vitro invasiveness of different human cancer cell lines, with the sole exception of TE671 cells. Heparin did not modify cell migration in any of the tested cancer cell lines. NT4 had no effect on cell proliferation, whereas, notably, heparin resulted to stimulate cell proliferation in some cancer cell lines. Differently from using heparin as an unspecific soluble decoy, targeting HSPG with well-defined ligands can result in an efficient tumor-specific treatment. Nevertheless, as for most cancer cellular targets, a detailed definition of cellular mechanisms and a related personalized approach is mandatory.<br \/>1) Sch&#252;nemann HJ et al.

The binding of TWEAK to Fn14 activates several intracellular signal transduction cascades that lead to cell death, proliferation, migration, or survival depending on the cellular contexts. Several studies have shown that Fn14 is upregulated in many solid tumors when compared with healthy tissues. The activation of TWEAK\/Fn14 signaling increases the proliferation, invasion, and migration of tumor cells. Moreover, angiogenesis, pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and epithelial-mesenchymal transitions are promoted upon TWEAK\/Fn14 activation. Therefore, Fn14 is considered a potential therapeutic target, and attempts to generate targeted therapeutics have achieved limited success in pre-clinical and clinical trials. We generated a completely human fusion protein, GrB-Fc-IT4, consisting of the IT4 scFv antibody targeting the Fn14 receptor and the serine protease granzyme B (GrB) as the cytotoxic payload. Comprehensive mechanism of action studies showed that GrB-Fc-IT4 effectively induced cell death <i>in vitro <\/i>against a broad selection of tumor types with high specificity. The intracellular pathway included rapid, irreversible activation of the caspase cascade and independent mitochondrial depolarization leading to intense apoptotic cellular damage. Pharmacokinetic studies in mice showed that GrB-Fc-IT4 cleared bi-exponentially from plasma with a rapid initial clearance (t <sub>&#189;<\/sub>&#945; = 0.36 hours) followed by a prolonged terminal-phase plasma half-life (t <sub>1\/2<\/sub>&#946; = 35 hours), similar to that of IgGs. Based on our PK study, we compared the <i>in vivo<\/i> antitumor efficacy of GrB-Fc-IT4 against A549 (NSCLC) tumors, using two different dosing schedules (QODx5 vs QWx5). Tumor efficacy showed a clear dose and schedule dependence. Mice bearing A549 tumors treated with 32 mg\/kg\/dose (QOWx5) exhibited complete tumor growth inhibition (7\/10 tumors regressed) with 3\/10 tumors showing no growth up to 50 days after the last dose. Thus, GrB-Fc-IT4 displays impressive <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> cytotoxic effects. Even though GrB-Fc-IT4 cross-reacts with the murine Fn14 antigen, maximum tolerated dose studies in mice have confirmed that GrB-Fc-IT4 is a safe product, as mice treated with the drug up to 500 mg\/kg showed no evidence of toxicity (changes in respiration, rough hair coat, unusual behavior or hunched posture). Taking in consideration these results we estimate that the therapeutic index for this class of drug is higher than four. Our data suggest that GrB-Fc-IT4 is a novel antitumor agent with a unique mechanism of action compared to all other therapeutic agents. The exceptionally safe and effective profile of this drug makes it an ideal candidate for advancing to clinical trials.

Additionally, high expression of FR&#945; has been associated with tumor progression and thus poor prognosis of cancer patients. Therefore, utilizing FR&#945; to effectively locate tumor cells for targeted therapy using antibody drug conjugates, small molecule drug conjugates, radioimmunoconjugates or chimeric antigen receptor T cells, has been extensively investigated. Although some of the mentioned targeted therapies have shown promising preclinical results, their clinical utility has been limited due to associated toxicities in healthy tissues. We generated two new fusion constructs targeting FR&#945; and containing active human granzyme B (GrB) as the cytotoxic payload. We used as binding domains two different scFvs targeting the FR&#945; from antibodies previously used in clinical trials. These human scFvs (mov003 and mov018) were fused to the human serine protease GrB through an engineered human IgG heavy-chain fragment (designated as Fc) which contains a dimerization domain for longer half-life. The cytotoxicity of the constructs against a panel of cell lines expressing various levels of FR&#945; showed a specific cytotoxic effect with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> in the low nanomolar range (5-100 nM), particularly exhibiting very low IC<sub>50<\/sub> values against breast and ovarian cell lines. FR&#945; negative cells demonstrated IC<sub>50<\/sub> levels in the micromolar range. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that the fusion constructs targeting FR&#945; are efficiently internalized and effectively delivered the active serine protease to the cytosol. <i>In vitro<\/i> stability assays over 96 hours showed that both constructs are highly stable in mouse serum. Additionally, recent publications suggested that FR&#945; is significantly associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and might serve as a therapeutic target. We assessed the cytotoxic efficacy of GrB-based constructs on a panel of FR&#945;+ AML cell lines and have found that these cell lines were very sensitive (IC<sub>50<\/sub> in the low nanomolar range). Furthermore, evaluation of GrB fusion efficacy in two AML cell lines resistant to Bcl-2 inhibitor Venetoclax showed IC<sub>50<\/sub>s to be similar or lower than their parental cell lines. These results, therefore, demonstrate no cross-resistance to GrB. The safe and effective profile of these drugs together with their unique mechanism of action makes them ideal candidates for advancing pre-clinical development and may offer a potential new strategy for treatment of solid tumors and particularly Venetoclax relapsed AML patients, ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy studies to compare the two constructs are warranted and will help to identify the optimal therapeutic for further clinical consideration.

While anti-VEGF therapy is a key therapeutic in several cancer treatment regimens, none of the current therapeutics (bevacizumab, VEGF-trap, tyrosine kinase inhibitors) are directly cytotoxic against tumor cells. The serine protease Granzyme B (GrB) is a key effector in immune-mediated cell killing by inducing apoptosis through both caspase-dependent and -independent mechanisms. We previously reported the development and characterization of a fusion protein composed of GrB and VEGF<sub>121<\/sub> (GrB\/VEGF<sub>121<\/sub>). Here, we report on GrB-Fc-VEGF<sub>121<\/sub>, a fusion protein that incorporates a human IgG heavy chain Fc fragment for dimerization which increases the molecular weight and improves <i>in vivo<\/i> circulation and targeting potential. GrB-Fc-VEGF<sub>121<\/sub> was expressed in HEK-293E cells under serum-free conditions and purified from the conditioned medium with a final yield of approximately 40 mg\/L. The enzymatic activity of GrB in GrB-Fc-VEGF<sub>121<\/sub> was comparable to that of commercially available human GrB. <i>In vitro<\/i> studies of GrB-Fc-VEGF<sub>121<\/sub> showed cytotoxicity in the nanomolar range against tumor and endothelial cell lines expressing high levels of VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2. Receptor-negative cells demonstrated IC<sub>50<\/sub> levels in the high micromolar range. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy demonstrated that GrB-Fc-VEGF<sub>121<\/sub> readily internalized into VEGFR-2+ tumor cells and endothelial cells within 2 hours of treatment while untargeted GrB did not internalize, suggesting internalization was receptor-mediated. Treatment of VEGFR-2+ endothelial and tumor cells at the IC<sub>50<\/sub> dose resulted in &#62;50% cell death via apoptosis and\/or necrosis within 48 h. <i>Ex vivo<\/i> serum stability of GrB-Fc-VEGF<sub>121<\/sub> indicated a gradual protein loss of GrB-Fc-VEGF<sub>121<\/sub>, with an overall stability of about 50% over 96 hours. No toxicity was observed in BALB\/c mice treated with a total 475 mg\/kg given IP every other day over 5 doses, indicating that the maximum tolerated dose of GrB-Fc-VEGF<sub>121<\/sub> exceeds this dose level. <i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy studies in an OVCAR8 tumor xenograft model with GrB-Fc-VEGF<sub>121<\/sub> (100 mg\/kg over 5 doses) resulted in significant growth inhibition of established tumors compared to vehicle controls. We observed a significant decrease in the number of CD31+ blood vessels and Ki-67+ proliferating tumor cells in treated tumors compared to controls. Thus, GrB-Fc-VEGF<sub>121<\/sub> has significant anti-tumor effects <i>in vivo<\/i> with virtually no toxicity against normal tissues at doses 4-5 times higher than therapeutic levels.

Pancreatic, ovarian, mesothelioma, and lung cancers highly express mesothelin and are cancers of unmet needs with &#8804;16% relative 5-year survival using standard of care. When delivered to tumor cells by immune effector cells, granzyme B (GrB) is a highly cytotoxic serine protease which induces apoptosis through both caspase-dependent and -independent mechanisms. We developed a fusion protein (GrB-Fc-SD1) composed of human GrB and containing SD1, a novel human single-domain antibody that uniquely targets Region III of the glycoprotein, mesothelin. The SD1 and GrB domains are connected by a human IgG heavy chain fragment which enables dimerization. Thus, the increase in total construct molecular weight leads to an increased <i>in vivo<\/i> circulation time and anti-tumor efficacy. GrB-Fc-SD1 was transiently expressed in HEK-293E cells under serum-free conditions and purified to homogeneity to a final yield of approximately 5 mg\/L. Anti-GrB western blot analysis confirmed the expression of GrB-Fc-SD1 exclusively as a dimer. Comparison of GrB-Fc-SD1 with its expected molecular weight suggests significant glycosylation when produced in HEK-293E cells. The enzymatic activity of granzyme B in GrB-Fc-SD1 was comparable to that of commercially available human granzyme B. <i>In vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity against a limited panel of lung, pancreatic and ovarian cancer cell lines expressing surface mesothelin indicate cytotoxicity in the nanomolar range, while cytotoxicity against mesothelin-negative cells was at micromolar levels. GrB-Fc-SD1 bound specifically to mesothelin extra-cellular domain compared to a non-specific control, as determined by ELISA. Biacore analysis confirmed binding with a dissociation constant between 10<sup>-7<\/sup> to 10<sup>-8<\/sup> M. These data warrant continued investigation of the protein as a therapeutic candidate.

Immunotherapy, for example, has greatly improved outcomes for people with several types of cancer that typically have a poor prognosis. However, the response rate depends on the type of cancer being treated, with an average response rate between 20 to 50%. Thus, novel approaches to overcome such therapeutic challenges are warranted. Emerging therapies include fusion proteins and immunoconjugates that deliver a cytotoxic payload to the tumor cell with more specificity and potentially less avenues for resistance than exerted by the antibody or toxin alone. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a cell surface protein normally found at low levels in adult tissues but over-expressed in a high percentage of solid tumors including colon and rectum, lung, prostate, ovary, thyroid, or liver. Thus, oncologic therapies against CEA may promote anti-tumor activity while sparing off-target toxicity to unaffected normal tissue. Our newly developed construct, designated GrB-Fc-huMFE, is a completely human fusion protein that contains the single-chain variable fragment huMFE antibody recognizing a juxta-membrane epitope of CEA remaining after proteolytic cleavage of CEA from the cell surface. The construct rapidly internalized into target cells resulting in granzyme B (GrB)-mediated mitochondrial depolarization and irreversible activation of both apoptotic and necrotic cascade mechanisms of cell death. <i>In vitro <\/i>cytotoxicity of GrB-Fc-huMFE against an initial subset of CEA+ tumor cell lines demonstrated cytotoxicity in the nanomolar range, compared to micromolar IC<sub>50<\/sub> cytotoxicity against CEA-negative cell lines. Significantly, GrB-Fc-huMFE cytotoxicity <i>in vitro <\/i>was unaffected by exogenously-added CEA extracellular domain at doses up to 1000 &#956;g\/ml, suggesting that the construct is not competitively absorbed by soluble CEA proteolytically released by tumors and present in the circulation of patients. An <i>in vivo <\/i>efficacy study against established CEA+ (A-549) tumors in nude mice resulted in significant growth inhibition compared to vehicle controls (1200 mm<sup>3<\/sup> vs &#60;40 mm<sup>3<\/sup>). Complete tumor regression was observed in 7\/10 tumors in mice treated (IP) with doses of 100 mg\/kg of GrB-Fc-huMFE in a Q3Dx5 dose administration schedule. Mouse weight was unaffected in both treated and control groups for the duration of the study, suggesting no apparent toxicity of the construct. Pharmacokinetic, stability and<i> in vitro<\/i> tests against a broader panel of tumor cell lines are ongoing and will be reported. Altogether, GrB-Fc-huMFE appears to have significant potential in targeting a large category of CEA-expressing solid tumors and is a promising candidate for further pre-clinical and eventual clinical development.

In the last decade, multiple anti-CD70 antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) have been developed, but most, if not all, of these ADC programs have been discontinued. Using an expanded genetic code to create Engineered Precision Biologics (EPBs), Ambrx has developed ARX305, a CD70-targeted next-generation antibody drug conjugate (ADC) to potentially overcome the challenges associated with earlier ADCs and treat patients with cancers over-expressing CD70. ARX305 is comprised of a proprietary, high-affinity, humanized anti-CD70 antibody stably and site-specifically conjugated to AS269, a potent microtubule inhibitor. After binding to CD70 expressed on target tumor cells, ARX305 internalizes and releases the cytotoxic payload pAF-AS269 which inhibits cellular proliferation. In vitro testing across a panel of solid and liquid tumor cell lines showed ARX305 elicited highly potent and specific cell killing across multiple tumor types with medium to high CD70 expression levels. In multiple in vivo CD70-expressing xenograft or disseminated models, ARX305 induced significant tumor growth inhibition or regression whereas unconjugated antibody exhibited poor activity. ARX305 utilizes stable oxime conjugation chemistry, a non-cleavable PEG linker, and a membrane-impermeable payload to minimize premature payload release in circulation and associated off-target toxicity. These properties of ARX305 result in high serum stability, with rodent pharmacokinetic studies confirming a similar exposure profile of ARX305 compared to unconjugated antibody and a long serum half-life. Repeat dose toxicokinetic studies in cynomolgus monkeys demonstrated ARX305 was tolerated at exposures well above therapeutic exposures in mouse pharmacology studies, indicating a wide therapeutic index. In summary, the highly potent anti-tumor activity in multiple tumor types and wide therapeutic index of ARX305 support clinical evaluation of this next generation anti-CD70 ADC. ARX305 is currently in a Phase 1 dose escalation study in China, and the IND in the United States is open.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),CD70,Site-specific,Targeted drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lillian Skidmore<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jingjing Zhu<sup>2<\/sup>, David Mills<sup>1<\/sup>, Ting Jin<sup>2<\/sup>, Suqin Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Keith Tatsukawa<sup>1<\/sup>, Nick  A.

Although expression of and signaling by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is commonly seen in TNBC, anti-EGFR antibodies such as Cetuximab have had limited therapeutic efficacy, used alone or in combination with chemotherapy.<br \/>Primary TNBC tumor growth and metastases require supporting vasculature, which develops through a combination of endothelial angiogenesis and vasculogenic mimicry (VM). VM is frequently seen in TNBC and is associated with aggressive metastatic behavior. We previously developed &#945;EGFR-E-P125A, an antibody-endostatin fusion protein, linking an anti-EGFR antibody to a mutated version of the anti-angiogenic protein endostatin (E-P125A). &#945;EGFR-E-P125A delivers a dimeric E-P125A payload which inhibits TNBC angiogenesis and VM <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, and markedly decreases metastasis in multiple TNBC xenograft models.<br \/>To study changes in the transcriptome following induction of VM and inhibition of VM with &#945;EGFR-E-P125A, RNA-seq was conducted on MDA-MB-231-4175 TNBC cells grown in a 2D monolayer and compared to TNBC cells undergoing VM when plated in matrigel. A second comparison was made between TNBC cells undergoing VM and TNBC cells in which VM was inhibited by treatment with &#945;EGFR-E-P125A. Differential gene expression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), were used to define pathways which were inversely regulated during the induction of VM on matrigel and inhibition of VM with &#945;EGFR-E-P125A.<br \/>Gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated that &#945;EGFR-E-P125A treatment significantly downregulated genes in the JAK-STAT and angiogenesis signaling pathways. Phospho-array analysis demonstrated decreased EGFR phosphorylation at Y1069 in addition to decreased phosphorylation of FAK Y397 and STAT3 Y705 sites downstream of &#945;5&#946;1 integrin. Since inhibition of EGFR signaling alone did not inhibit VM, and endostatin is a known ligand of &#945;5&#946;1 integrin, we focused on effects of &#945;EGFR-E-P125A on inhibition of &#945;5&#946;1 integrin\/FAK signaling pathway. Independent siRNA knockdowns of &#945;5 integrin and FAK in MDA-MB-231-4175 cells confirmed that downregulation of &#945;5 integrin\/FAK signaling inhibited VM <i>in vitro<\/i>.<br \/>&#945;EGFR-E-P125A additionally prevented EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation and fibronectin-induced FAK phosphorylation by &#945;5&#946;1 integrin. Treatment of TNBC cells with &#945;EGFR-E-P125A reduced total &#945;5 integrin protein levels and decreased co-localization of EGFR and &#945;5&#946;1 integrin receptors. These results indicate that &#945;EGFR-E-P125A suppressed both EGFR and &#945;5&#946;1 integrin signaling. Simultaneous inhibition of EGFR and &#945;5&#946;1integrin signaling by &#945;EGFR-E-P125A fusion is a promising approach to inhibition of TNBC growth and metastases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,Integrins,Targeted therapy,Migration,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ankita Sankar<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hava Gil Henn<sup>2<\/sup>, Hyun Mi Cho<sup>1<\/sup>, Dania Nassar<sup>2<\/sup>, Sundaram Ramakrishnan<sup>1<\/sup>, Yu Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Christian Elledge<sup>1<\/sup>, Seung Uon Shin<sup>1<\/sup>, Joseph Rosenblatt<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL,<sup>2<\/sup>Bar Ilan University, Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, Tzfat, Israel","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"307913a0-b832-4b26-a213-afd9a891400f","ControlNumber":"3243","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

It is overexpressed in several human malignancies, primarily in ovarian, renal, but also (to a lesser degree) gastric, thyroid, cholangiocarcinoma and other tumor types. The characteristics of limited expression in normal tissues, high expression in tumor tissues, and rapid internalization upon antibody binding makes CDH6 a well-suited Antibody-drug Conjugate (ADC) target. We developed a novel CDH6-targeting ADC, CUSP06, consisting of a proprietary humanized antibody selective for CDH6, a protease cleavable linker, and an exatecan payload, with a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 8. CUSP06 selectively bound to cell surface CDH6 and was efficiently internalized into CDH6 positive ovarian and renal cancer cells. CUSP06 exhibited strong antiproliferative activity against several CDH6 positive cancer cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i>. Furthermore, compared to a DXd-based ADC, a exatecan-based ADC demonstrated improved bystander effect. Treatment with CUSP06 resulted in tumor regression in several CDH6 positive cell line derived xenograft (CDX) models, including PA-1, OVCAR3, and 786-O. In addition, CUSP06 demonstrated potent antitumor activity with tumor regression observed in two CDH6 low and high expressing patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. The preclinical activity of CUSP06 against CDH6-expressing tumors provide compelling support for the clinical development of CUSP06 in CDH6-expressing human cancers. CUSP06 is currently in IND-enabling studies. CUSP06 showed an expected toxicity profile consistent with it's exatecan payload in the ongoing pilot toxicology studies. We plan to initiate a Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial in the 2<sup>nd<\/sup> half of 2023.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Cadherin,Topoisomerase I inhibitor,Renal cell carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Wei Lu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jing Shi<sup>2<\/sup>, Shu-Hui Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Nicole Covino<sup>1<\/sup>, Xun Meng<sup>2<\/sup>, Eric D.

Dysregulation of FGFR signaling due to receptor fusion, mutation or amplification is observed across multiple cancer types, making activated FGFRs an important therapeutic target. Herein, we present the preclinical characterization of HMPL-453, a highly potent and selective inhibitor of FGFR1, 2, and 3, discovered and being currently developed in phase II clinical trial (NCT04353375) by HUTCHMED.<br \/>Methods: Kinase activity was measured by Transcreener&#8482; Fluorescence Polarization assay or Z&#8217;-LYTE kinase assay. <i>In vitro<\/i> anti-proliferation activity was measured by CellTiter-Glo luminescent or CCK-8 assay. The effect of HMPL-453 on FGFR signaling pathway was detected by western blot. Multiple tumor models with FGFR alteration were applied in Nu\/Nu nude mice to determine anti-tumor efficacy of 453 as a single agent. A model in immune-competent BALB\/c mice inoculated with the constructed NIH\/3T3 cells carrying FGFR2-AHCYL1 fusion was chosen to investigate the combination effect of HMPL-453 with anti-PD-1 antibody.<br \/>Results: HMPL-453 potently inhibited the tyrosine kinase activities of recombinant FGFR 1, 2, and 3 <i>in vitro<\/i> (IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 6, 4, and 6 nM, respectively) with weaker activity against FGFR4 (IC<sub>50 <\/sub>= 425 nM). HMPL-453 selectively inhibited proliferation of tumor cell lines with dysregulated FGFR signaling (GI<sub>50<\/sub>s: 3~105 nM) compared with cell lines lacking FGFR aberrations (GI<sub>50<\/sub>s &#62; 1.5 &#181;M). HMPL-453 demonstrated strong inhibition of phosphorylation of FGFR and downstream protein in tumor cell lines harboring FGFR2 fusion. Oral administration of HMPL-453 could induce time- and dose-dependent inhibition of phosphorylation of FGFR and resulted in remarkable and dose-dependent anti-tumor activity in multiple FGFR-altered tumor models. HMPL-453 at the dose of 50 mg\/kg\/day could induce tumor regression in most tumor models tested. Moreover, HMPL-453 significantly improved anti-tumor activity of anti-PD-1 antibody in a FGFR2 fusion model by priming the immune environment.<br \/>Conclusion: HMPL-453 is a highly potent and selective inhibitor of FGFR 1, 2, and 3 with strong activity against FGFR-deregulated tumors in preclinical models, supporting continued investigation in patients with FGFR alterations (such as fusion and mutation) either as a single agent or in combination with PD-1 blockade.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR),,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jia Hu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jun Ni<sup><\/sup>, Longxian Jiao<sup><\/sup>, Jinghong Zhou<sup><\/sup>, Shiming Fan<sup><\/sup>, Renxiang Tang<sup><\/sup>, Wei Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Xuelei Ge<sup><\/sup>, Qihang Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Juntao Yu<sup><\/sup>, Ying Yu<sup><\/sup>, Dongxia Shi<sup><\/sup>, Min Cheng<sup><\/sup>, Weifang Xue<sup><\/sup>, Sumei Xia<sup><\/sup>, Zeyu Zhong<sup><\/sup>, Jian Wang<sup><\/sup>, Yang Sai<sup><\/sup>, Weiguo Qing<sup><\/sup>, Guangxiu Dai<sup><\/sup>, Yongxin Ren<sup><\/sup>, Michael Shi<sup><\/sup>, Weiguo Su<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>HUTCHMED Limited, Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"08a836da-7d37-4a01-8489-fd22523861fe","ControlNumber":"1981","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.
