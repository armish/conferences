[{"Abstract":"<i><u>Background <\/u><\/i> Social isolation or living alone can negatively affect mental health, sleep quality, eating behavior, immunity, proinflammatory response to stress, and receipt of care in cancer patients (e.g., assistance with nutrition and mobility, emotional and informational support), which may increase the risk of death from cancer. Previous studies, however, have shown inconsistent findings on the association between social isolation and cancer mortality. To address the literature gap, we examined this association among working-age adults stratified by sociodemographic characteristics using a nationally representative cohort with long-term mortality follow-up.<br \/><i><u>Method<\/u><\/i> We used the pooled 1998-2019 data for adults aged 18-64 years at enrollment from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) linked to National Death Index (N=473,648) with up to 22 years of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model survival time as a function of social isolation, measured by &#8220;living alone&#8221;, and sociodemographic, behavioral, and health characteristics. We estimated differential effects of social isolation on cancer mortality by age, sex, race\/ethnicity, poverty level, and education, overall and for select common cancers (lung, colorectal, and female breast) with &#62;100 deaths in the public use NHIS-linked mortality database, 1998-2004.<br \/><i><u>Results<\/u><\/i> The cancer mortality risk was 32% higher (hazard ratio [HR]=1.32; 95%CI:1.25,1.39) in adults living alone, controlling for age, and 16% higher (HR=1.16; 95%CI:1.10,1.23) in adults living alone, controlling for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, when compared to adults living with others. The association between living alone and cancer mortality persisted after additional adjustments for health-risk behaviors and health status (HR=1.10, 95%CI:1.04,1.16). Stratified models generally showed similar associations between social isolation and cancer mortality risk across categories of sex, poverty, and education in age-adjusted models. However, the association was stronger among non-Hispanic (NH) White than NH Black adults and did not exist in other racial\/ethnic groups. The associations were attenuated after additional adjustments but persisted in fully adjusted models among males, females, NH White people, and adults with a college degree. In the age-adjusted models, social isolation was associated with a higher risk of death from lung (HR=1.45; 95%CI:1.81,2.45) and colorectal (HR=1.65; 95%CI:2.58,1.56), but not from female breast cancer.<br \/><i><u>Conclusions<\/u><\/i> In this nationally representative study in the United States, adults living alone were at a higher risk of cancer death compared to adults living with others. These findings underscore the significance of addressing social isolation in the general population and among cancer survivors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mortality,Risk factors,Cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hyunjung Lee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Gopal K.

There has been mixed evidence regarding whether rural vs. urban residence is an independent risk factor for skin cancer, and it is not clear to what degree these differences are driven by demographic or behavioral factors. We investigated if there are differences in skin cancer sun protection behaviors between urban and rural residents.<br \/>Methods: We used data from three (2013-2018) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycles. Sunburns and sun exposure and behavior measures were dichotomized: 2+ hours outside during work days or non-work days, at least one sunburn in the past year (yes\/no); sunscreen use, wearing long sleeves, staying in the shade (never, rarely, sometimes\/most of the time, always). Urban\/rural residence was measured as a 2-level indicator. We compared sunburn and sun behavior measures by rural-urban status using adjusted survey-weighted logistic regression models. Because of distribution difference by rural-urban status, we stratified by non-Hispanic (NH) white identity vs. identifying as a person of color. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals presented were adjusted for age, sex, income, education, body mass index, and smoking.<br \/>Results: When comparing urban vs. rural residents, both NH white individuals (42.9 vs. 29.1%, OR: 1.60 [1.27, 2.01]) and people of color (48.9 vs. 36.5%, OR: 1.54 [1.08, 2.19]) in rural communities had greater odds of spending 2+ hours outside on work days. Rural NH white residents had greater odds of spending 2+ hours outside on non-work days (64.8 vs. 72.2%, OR: 1.45 [1.12, 1.88]). Both rural NH white individuals (26.7 vs. 21.6%, OR: 0.72 [0.57, 0.89]) and rural people of color (41.1 vs. 35.5%, OR: 0.81 [0.68, 0.97]) had lower odds of staying in the shade. Rural NH white residents reported lower sunscreen use (35.1 vs. 26.0%, OR: 0.74 [0.59, 0.93]). Among people of color, rural residency was associated with greater odds of at least one sunburn in the past year (34.5 vs. 24.7%, OR: 1.60 [1.23, 2.09]). Sunburns were more frequent overall (59-61%) in NH white individuals; however, no significant differences by rural-urban residence were observed.<br \/>Conclusions: Rural residents report engaging in skin cancer preventative sun behaviors less often than urban residents. Greater sunburn frequency among rural and urban NH white individuals compared with individuals of color is consistent with higher skin cancer rates in NH white individuals. However, over 25% of people of color reported a sunburn in the past year, highlighting the importance of intervention on skin cancer risk beyond NH white individuals. Consistently less sun protection behavior across rural populations even after adjustment for demographics emphasizes that rurality should be recognized as an independent risk factor for sun risk behaviors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Skin carcinogenesis,Prevention,Risk factors,Behavior,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Allison  C.

Therefore, City of Hope partnered with Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and community and faith-based organizations to improve CRC screening among medically underserved communities.<br \/>METHODS: Between October 2020 and October 2022, we implemented a multi-component intervention that included community outreach and education (a multi-ethnic multimedia campaign and community training adapted from the NCI Screen2Save (S2S) program) and clinic-based interventions (provider\/staff training and patient education). Intervention reach and training participant surveys were assessed. Within our four FQHC sites, we also compared clinic-level CRC screening rates among age-eligible patients before (June 2021) and after implementation of the clinic-based intervention (June 2022).<br \/>RESULTS: Our reach assessment showed that our multi-ethnic multimedia campaign reached 35.4 million impressions, our S2S education training reached 300 diverse community members, and our provider\/staff training reached 150 medical providers. Among the 100 providers surveyed, &#62;80% felt confident they could get their patients to complete their CRC screening test and follow-up care. For the clinic-based intervention component, our baseline sample included 11,259 age-eligible patients across the four FQHC sites. Overall CRC screening rates increased from 45% to 52% before vs. after the intervention implementation period. The site with the highest CRC screening rate (&#62;62%) maintained steady rates over the observation period, whereas three sites with lower baseline rates showed greater pre-post improvements (average 15 percentage-point increase).<br \/>CONCLUSIONS: An overall increase in CRC screening rates was achieved across FQHCs, despite clinic staffing challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.

All CRC cases diagnosed during 2009-2017 were identified using the United States Cancer Statistics database. Late-stage CRC was determined according to the presence of distant involvement (node or site) of the tumor at diagnosis. Racialized economic segregation was measured at the county level by the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE) using the 2013-2017 American Community Survey estimates. ICE was calculated to show the extent to which individuals&#8217; residence at diagnosis was located in counties of concentrated advantage or disadvantage. Four ICE metrics were considered, consisting of the difference between the number of households with White individuals reporting incomes in the top quintile of the US distribution, and the number of households with non-White (all people of color (POC), Black, Latino, or Asian American\/Pacific Islander) individuals reporting incomes in the lowest quintile, divided by the total of households in the county. ICE metrics were further divided into quintiles based on the distribution of all counties in the US, with Q1 denoting least advantaged counties and Q5 the most advantaged counties. Multilevel logistic regression models accounting for clustering at counties were fit. Models were adjusted for age at diagnosis, sex, race and ethnicity, census region and year of diagnosis. A total of 1,356,053 cases were included in the analysis; mean age at diagnosis was 67 years, 52% were men, and 20% of cases had a late-stage diagnosis. In adjusted analysis for ICE-POC, people residing in less advantaged counties had higher odds of late-stage diagnosis than people residing in the most advantaged counties (OR [95% CI], Q1: 1.08 [1.05-1.11], Q2: 1.06 [1.04-1.09], Q3: 1.04 [1.02-1.07], Q4: 1.03 [1.01-1.05], Q5: reference). Similar results were observed on all four ICE metrics. Racialized economic segregation was associated with higher odds of late-stage CRC. These findings underscore the role of institutionalized racism as a driver of health inequities, with laws and policies that led to residential segregation also impacting the conditions for timely preventive care.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Residential segregation,Late-stage diagnosis,Cancer health disparities,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Eduardo  J.

Following CRC treatment, about 37% of CRC survivors experience symptoms associated with anxiety and depression. Additionally, psychosocial distress is especially prevalent among CRC survivors with a stoma, and those reporting CRC-induced sexual dysfunction. Pharmacotherapy is one of the mainstay treatment options for psychological distress among patients with CRC. Research has shown that racial disparities are present with the use of supportive care medications in other cancer types. However, this has not been explored with the use of psychotropic medication for patients with CRC. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the presence of racial disparities in psychotropic medication use among patients with CRC.<br \/>Methods: Utilizing the National Cancer Institute Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (NCI SEER)- Medicare linked database, our analysis included all patients with a CRC diagnosis and an active outpatient prescription claims for psychotropic medications from 2009-2018. Prescription claims were specific to patients diagnosed with CRC and stratified by self-identified race and ethnicity. Patients who were on psychotropic medications before CRC diagnosis, or unspecified race or ethnicity were excluded from the analysis. Psychotropic medications consisted of anxiolytics, antidepressants, and antipsychotic medications.<br \/>Results: 136,014 participants were included in the analysis. The racial and ethnic breakdown comprised of 81.56% White, 11.22% African American (AA), 2.66% Hispanic, 4.27% Asian\/Pacific Islander (API), and 0.25% Native American (NA). Results are presented as unadjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Compared to White patients, AA (OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.50-0.56), API (OR 0.50; 95% CI 0.46-0.54), Hispanic (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.58-0.71), and NA (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.43-0.81) patients had lower utilization of anxiolytic medications. Regarding antidepressant use, AA (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.53-0.57), API (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.43-0.49), Hispanic (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.68-0.79), and NA (OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.63-0.96) had lower utilization compared to White patients. Differences in antipsychotic medication use was observed with Asian\/Pacific Islanders (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.64-0.78) and Native Americans (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.31-0.76) compared to White patients. No other racial differences in antipsychotic medications were identified.<br \/>Conclusion: The study showed that racial and ethnic disparities are present with the use of psychotropic medications among patients with CRC. Racial and ethnic minority patients had lower use for most of the drug classes evaluated. Further research is warranted to assess the potential barriers and facilitators of psychotropic medication use among patients belonging to historically minoritized racial and ethnic groups.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Supportive care ,psychotropic medications,health disparities,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>MegCholack Awunti<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yi Guo<sup>2<\/sup>, Sherise Rogers<sup>2<\/sup>, Lisa Scarton<sup>2<\/sup>, Diana Wilkie<sup>2<\/sup>, John Allen<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Florida, Orlando, FL,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Florida, Gainesville, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"be6922c5-6c1f-4130-bd96-b53f3385742d","ControlNumber":"6708","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Within the U.S., the incidence and death rates differ by ethnicity. Among Hispanics, CRC accounted for 12% and 8% of all estimated new cases of cancer and 11% and 9% of all cancer deaths in men and women, respectively, in 2018. Though CRC is preventable, and the overall survival rate is approximately 90% when detected at early stages, only about 39% of CRC patients are diagnosed in the early stages, mostly because screening rates in the US are low, especially among Hispanics. Access to health care for Hispanics is limited when compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs); as a result, they tend to present with later-stage CRC, which likely accounts for their inferior survival after CRC. Essential to improving treatment, prognosis, and detection strategies is the identification and validation of new ethnicity-specific transcriptomic profiles. Here, we have conducted RNA sequencing from Hispanic and NHW CRC (n=10 each) and normal adjacent tissues (NATs; n=3 each), to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in these two populations. The Illumina sequencing reads were mapped against the reference human genome, and the read counts were normalized using the median of ratios method using DESeq2 software. The transcriptomic analysis revealed that as compared to the respective NATs, 7222 and 7873 genes were observed to be differentially expressed in NHW and Hispanic CRC tissues. Among these, 213 and 363 genes were unique to the NHW and Hispanic CRC cohorts, respectively. Within the Hispanic cohort, gender-based analyses revealed that 504 and 266 genes were differentially expressed in the female and male donors (n=5 each), respectively, as compared to the NHW counterparts. Further, 271 and 475 genes were found to be differentially expressed in early (stage I\/II; n=5) and late (stage III\/ IV; n=3) stages of Hispanic CRC tissues, respectively, as compared to the NHW counterparts. Pathway enrichment analysis of the unique DEGs from the Hispanic and NHW cohorts was conducted using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. The genes involved in cysteine biosynthesis, ferroptosis, and GABA receptor signaling pathways were seen to be enriched in the NHW cohort, whereas the genes involved in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling, bile, and androgen biosynthesis pathways were enriched in the Hispanic cohort. Previous studies have implicated, GR signaling to promote tumor heterogeneity and invasion in CRC via <i>CDK1<\/i>, or bile acids to regulate numerous genes including <i>p53, CDK1, cyclooxygenase 2, IL8<\/i>, and various miRNAs leading to CRC metastasis. As each pathway likely regulates specific cellular behaviors, the DEGs identified from this study will constitute potential ethnicity-specific biomarkers or attractive targets for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Hispanic,Transcriptomics,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Soumya Nair<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Aditi Kulkarni<sup><\/sup>, Sourav Roy<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a63bb224-713b-4cf1-bb25-9a18852cedd7","ControlNumber":"6437","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Most cases occur between 40 and 49 years. Adolescents and young adults (AYA,15-39 years) with CRC have more aggressive disease. We sought to compare the incidence and outcomes of CRC in AYA with patients in the 40-49 age group.<br \/>Methods: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result (SEER) was analyzed from 2000-2019. Survival outcomes were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods, and comparisons were made using the log-rank test. Cox regression models were used to evaluate univariate and multivariate associations with survival outcomes. SAS v9.4 (Cary, NC) and SEER*Stat v8.4 were used, with a significance level of 0.05.Results: A total of 13,877 AYA patients and 43,771 patients in the age group 40-49 years were identified. The annual incidence rate per 100,000 AYA patients increased from 3.1 in 2000 to 5.3 in 2019. In the 40-49 cohort, the annual incidence rate per 100,000 increased from 21.6 in 2000 to 28.0 in 2019. The annual percent change for incidence for the AYA cohort was higher 3.1% (95% CI 2.8,3.4) than the 40-49 cohort 1.4% (95% CI 1.2,1.6). The 2-year overall survival (OS) rate was not different among the two groups. Disease-specific survival (DSS) was slightly but significantly inferior in the AYA group, 83% (95%CI 0.82,0.83) compared to in the 40-49 cohort, 84% (95%CI 0.83,0.84). Factors associated with inferior DSS in the AYA group were male sex, black race, advanced stage, lack of chemotherapy, and longer time to treatment.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study shows that the annual percent change in incidence rate was higher in AYA patients compared to those in the 40-49 age group from 2000-2019. DSS was slightly lower in AYA patients; OS was similar in both groups.

In this retrospective analysis, the NCDB database was used to evaluate the determinants that affected access to multi-agent therapy among MM patients who were treated in commission on cancer-accredited facilities across the USA.<br \/>Methods: Using the NCDB, we identified N= 171,261 patients diagnosed with MM from 2004 to 2017. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the predictive factors for receiving multi-agent therapy, using significance level of p&#38;lt0.05. Multivariable cox regression was used to determine factors affecting survival in patients receiving multi-agent therapy. Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves for single and multi-agents were produced. SAS version 9.4 was used to analyze the data.<br \/>Results: Five potential disparity factors were identified by multivariate logistic regression analysis: race and ethnicity, facility type, insurance status, median household income and level of education. Non-Hispanic Black patients had lower odds of receiving multi-agent therapy compared to Non-Hispanic White patients (OR=0.93, p&#38;lt0.0001). Hispanic Black patients had higher odds of receiving multi-agent therapy compared to Non-Hispanic Black patients (Hispanic Black vs Non-Hispanic Black: OR=1.47, p=0.01). Patients who weren't treated in academic centers were less likely to be treated with multi-agent therapy (OR=0.75, p&#38;lt0.0001). Those with Medicaid or Medicare were less likely to receive multi-agent regimen than those with private insurance (OR=0.88, p&#38;lt0.0001, OR=0.86, p&#38;lt0.0001, respectively). Patients with lower median household incomes had lower access to multi-agent therapy (OR=0.86, p&#38;lt0.0001). Those with lower level of education were less likely to be treated with multi-agent regimens than those who were (OR=0.93, p=0.0133). KM survival curves showed significant survival benefit for patients who received multi-agent therapy. Our data indicates that when Black and Hispanic patients receive multi-agent MM therapy, they tend to have better outcomes compared to White and Non-Hispanic patients (HR=1 and 0.92 for White and Black patients respectively; HR=1 and 0.8 for Non-Hispanic and Hispanic patients respectively, p&#38;lt0.0001).<br \/>Conclusion: In this large analysis of MM patients, we identified that Non-Hispanic Black patients and those with a lower socioeconomic status were less likely to receive the standard of care multi-agent therapy in this large cohort of real world data set from across the USA. These results further corroborate the need to provide equitable access to care, which will translate to better clinical outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Databases,Immunotherapy,Chemotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ludovic Saba<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chakra Pani Chaulagain<sup>1<\/sup>, Hong Liang<sup>2<\/sup>, Barbara Dominguez<sup>1<\/sup>, Chieh-Lin Fu<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Hematology-Oncology, Cleveland Clinic Florida Foundation, Weston, FL,<sup>2<\/sup>Cleveland Clinic Florida Foundation, Weston, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a6a411b6-9701-4cb9-882b-b16fac37e73b","ControlNumber":"2964","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

Increasing evidence suggests that biological differences between EA and AA women, particularly differences in epigenetic changes of DNA methylation (DNAm), may contribute to the observed cancer disparity. We hypothesize that racial differences in DNAm in normal breast tissue may reflect distinct genomic susceptibility to breast cancer in different racial groups. Therefore, we investigated epigenome-wide differences of DNAm in normal breast tissue between 178 EA and 272 AA women using the Illumina TruSeq Methyl Capture EPIC library and NGS technology. We identified 17,340 differentially methylated CpG loci (DMLs) between EA and AA women, of which 7,744 were hypermethylated in AA women and 9,596 were hypermethylated in EA women. Pathway analyses of genes annotated to these racial DMLs suggested enrichment of biological processes including cell movement, cell motility, and cell migration, features that are likely linked to the aggressiveness and metastatic potentials of tumor cells. We further examined racial differences in DNAm of breast cancer-related candidate genes and GWAS-identified breast cancer risk loci. Approximately 30% of candidate genes were found to have racial differences in DNAm at more than three CpG sites and these candidate genes were enriched for pathways related to response to stimulus and anatomic structure development. Most interestingly, racial DMLs were found to be enriched for breast cancer risk loci that are associated with risk of estrogen-receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer, treatment response to aromatase inhibitor, and breast cancer-specific morality, phenotypes of which we observed differences between EA and AA breast cancer patients. Our results suggest that racial differences in DNAm in normal breast tissue may induce different biological processes that lead to distinct clinical features of breast tumors observed in EA and AA women and provide an epigenetic mechanism underlying the observed racial disparities. Further research is need to validate the findings of this study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Epigenetics,Cancer genetics,Epidemiology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Nan Lin<sup><\/sup>, James Castle<sup><\/sup>, Jinpeng Liu<sup><\/sup>, <b>Chunyan He<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"80ae1fbb-5193-4257-9edf-ea9854a71852","ControlNumber":"2942","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

Little is known of the type and frequency of mutations in Hispanic populations in the United States and Central American countries, including Guatemala.<br \/>Methods: We used exome sequencing to identify mutations in blood DNA from unselected Hispanic breast cancer cases from community recruitment and from two hospitals each in Texas and Guatemala. Data from a structured questionnaire was used to compare mutation carriers of medium and high penetrance genes. Variants were annotated with ClinVar and VarSome.<br \/>Results: We recruited 262 Hispanic US women, 37 (14%) from community-based recruitment and 225 (86%) from hospitals in Texas. In addition, we ascertained 633 patients from two hospitals in Guatemala City. A total of 91 out of 895 subjects (10%) had a variant classified as pathogenic in a gene with known high or medium penetrance for inherited breast cancer. The most frequently mutated genes were the high penetrance <i>BRCA1 <\/i>(44\/895, 4.9%) followed by <i>BRCA2 <\/i>(23\/895, 2.6%), <i>PALB2<\/i> (5\/895, 0.6%), <i>CHEK2 <\/i>(5\/895 0.6%), <i>ATM <\/i>(6\/895, 0.7%) and <i>TP53<\/i> (6\/895, 0.7%). Pathogenic variants were also detected in the moderate penetrance genes <i>BARD1 <\/i>and <i>MSH6<\/i>, and rare pathogenic variants detected in the low penetrance genes <i>AXIN2<\/i>, <i>FH<\/i>, <i>MLH1, MSH2, MUTYH<\/i>, <i>NF1<\/i>, and <i>SDHB<\/i>. The high ratio of <i>BRCA1<\/i>\/<i>BRCA2<\/i> mutations is due to the presence of two potential founder mutations, <i>BRCA1 c.212+1G&#62;A <\/i>splice mutation (18 cases) and <i>BRCA1 c.799delT<\/i> (9 cases) in Guatemala. Compared to all others, cases with pathogenic mutations had a significantly earlier age at diagnosis (45 vs. 52 years, P&#60;0.001) and were more likely to have a diagnosis before menopause. A higher percentage of mutation carriers had a relative with any cancer (51% vs. 37%, P=0.038) or breast cancer (33% vs. 15%, P&#60;0.001). Patients with pathogenic mutations had a significantly higher percentage of triple-negative disease (60% vs. 13%, P=0.00046). Finally, mammography usage was less frequent in women with a lower socioeconomic status, indicating that this group is less likely to be screened for breast cancer (P&#60;0.001).<br \/>Conclusions: Guatemalan women have rates of hereditary breast cancer mutations like other populations, and these women are more likely to have early age at diagnosis, triple-negative disease, and<br \/>family history. Patient recruitment was higher using hospital-based versus community enrollment. This data supports genetic testing in breast cancer patients and those at high risk as part of a strategy to reduce breast cancer mortality in Hispanic women.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,BRCA1,BRCA2,Hispanic,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jesica Godinez Paredes<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Isabel Rodriguez<sup>1<\/sup>, Megan Ren<sup>1<\/sup>, Anali Orozco<sup>2<\/sup>, Jeremy Ortiz<sup>2<\/sup>, Anaseidy Albanez<sup>2<\/sup>, Catherine Jones<sup>3<\/sup>, Zeina Nahleh<sup>4<\/sup>, Lilian Barreda<sup>5<\/sup>, Lisa Garland<sup>6<\/sup>, Dongjing Wu<sup>6<\/sup>, Jiahui Wang<sup>6<\/sup>, Victor Argueta<sup>5<\/sup>, Roberto Orozco<sup>5<\/sup>, Eduardo Gharzouzi<sup>7<\/sup>, Michael Dean<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD,<sup>2<\/sup>Instituto Cancerologia, Guatemala City, Guatemala,<sup>3<\/sup>Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center Cancer Institute, Lubbock, TX,<sup>4<\/sup>Cleveland Clinic Florida, Weston, FL,<sup>5<\/sup>Hospital General San Juan de Dios, Guatemala City, Guatemala,<sup>6<\/sup>Cancer Genetics Research Laboratory, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Rockville, MD,<sup>7<\/sup>Integra Cancer Center, Guatemala City, Guatemala","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d3b760ce-cd1b-4b84-abe3-08193a1a39bb","ControlNumber":"2023","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

In cancer health services research there are myriad methodologies and data sources to study cancer treatment outcomes including medical records, cancer registries, and primary data collection. These different methodologies have varying levels of resource intensity that may affect the recruitment of marginalized populations. Little is known about how much concordance between data sources may exist among marginalized populations with cancer, which has substantial implications for cancer inequities research.<br \/><b>Objective<\/b>: To evaluate the data concordance between medical records, cancer registries, and self-reported survey data among an underrepresented population in cancer population sciences research.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: This investigation used a population-based sample of self-identified Black women recruited through the Tennessee and Florida Cancer registries who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer at or below the age of 50. Participants completed medical records release forms and questionnaires about their cancer treatment trajectories. Comparing data contained in the cancer registries, medical records, and self-reported data, we quantitatively assessed the concordance between data sources for receipt of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, using medical records as the gold standard.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: In total, 558 Black women at or below 50 with invasive breast cancer had available registry data and also completed a medical records release. In terms of missing data for receipt of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, self-report was the most complete, followed by the registry and then the medical records. Among those with complete data, comparing the medical records to the cancer registry, accuracy was high for surgery (94.6% ; 95% CI 92.2, 96.4) and chemotherapy (89.7%; 95% CI: 85.7, 92.8) , but low for radiation (55.4%, 95% CI: 48.5, 62.2) with the cancer registry missing the receipt of radiation that was noted in the medical records. Comparing medical records to self-report data, accuracy was &#62;90% for surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation.

This study inspected outcomes of triple negative BC (TNBC), hormone receptor (HR) positive (+) HER2 negative (-), and HER2+ BC pts treated with NAC at John Peter Smith Hospital (JPS) in Tarrant County, TX.<br \/>Methods: It is an IRB exempted retrospective review of JPS Oncology and Infusion Center&#8217;s registry data. Eligible pts were diagnosed with TNBC, HR+ HER2-, or HER2+ BC from 1\/1\/2016 to 12\/31\/2019 and underwent NAC. Age, race, NAC regimen, tumor grade, recurrence, and pt survival were collected from EPIC EMR. NCCN guidelines were used to standardize clinical prognostic and pathologic anatomic stages. Decrease in stage by at least one level was considered as improvement.<br \/>Results: Refer to table for additional results. Total of 104 pts. 22 (21.2%) had recurrence, 14 (14.5%) had died. Using the full cox proportional hazard model, TNBC pts&nbsp;had a 3.214 times higher hazard of death\/recurrence compared to other subsets (95% CI: 1.261, 8.193; p= 0.0145).&nbsp;70 (67.3%) pts showed improvement in stage. 34 (32.7%) achieved pathological complete response (pCR). When compared to pts with residual disease, achieving pCR reduced hazard of death\/recurrence by 71.6% (HR: 0.284; 95% CI: 0.095, 0.849; p= 0.0243).&nbsp;<br \/>Conclusion: A clear unmet need is poor survival of Black TNBC pts. Safety net hospitals, like JPS, disproportionately treat Black pts. We show that attaining pCR correlates with improved survival, but less than a quarter of TNBC pts attained pCR. New NAC regimens with Pembrolizumab has become standard of care for TNBC pts since 2021 due to higher pCR rates. Still, there is a need for better NAC regimens to improve pCR in TNBC overall and clinical trials on new regimens should include Black pts. Also, more than a third of HR+ HER2- pts upstaged in LN after NAC. This suggests a need for pre-NAC radiology staging methods and better NAC regimen testing for this subset.<table class=\"AbstractTable\" id=\"{BE5FACFF-15D5-4C88-9E66-3BE5B1202195}\"><caption

While The Latino population is one of the fastest-growing populations in the US, they are severely underrepresented in clinical trials. Latinos make up 17% of the population but only 1% of clinical trial participants. Of clinical trials published covering 2001-2010, Latinos&#8217; enrollment constituted only 2.2% of accrued participants. The percentage of Latino participants narrows down when we separate by gender. The goal of this study is to examine the prevalence of breast cancer-related barriers among Latinas and to determine the extent to which these barriers might influence Latinas enrolling in breast cancer clinical trials. If language and religion are the reason Latinas enroll less in breast cancer clinical trials, then increasing the availability of translated materials and a priest of a Catholic Church advertising the breast cancer studies will increase the enrollment rate of Latinas. Semi-constructed interviews were conducted with two Latino organizations to understand current barriers Latina&#8217;s face within the medical field. Based on these findings, I conducted an intervention at Our Lady of Tepeyac Church consisting of an information booth, making an announcement regarding Research Study 9127, and having bilingual Latinas available to give out more information while helping them enroll in Research Study 9127. At the end of the church intervention, 33 Latinas were enrolled in Research Study 9127, seeing a 550% increase in Latinas participating in Research Study 9127. Latinx women remain severely underrepresented in breast cancer clinical trials, thus limiting the generalizability of cancer clinical research, but interventions across churches would lead to improvements in general cancer knowledge, breast cancer screening practices, and intentions to enroll in clinical trials. This study can inform efforts to increase clinical trial participation in Latinas by highlighting important motivators to participation specific to Latinas and informing future interventions aimed at encouraging participation in clinical trials in a culturally sensitive and effective way.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hispanic,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Monica J.

In contrast to other ethnic groups, AAs are disproportionately affected by various types of cancers in the U.S., such as prostate &#38; pancreatic cancer, and have higher cancer mortality rates. Yet AA participation in cancer clinical trials remains extremely low. Black\/African Americans make up 13.4% of the US population and have a clinical trial enrollment rate of less than 5%. In comparison, White\/Caucasians make up about 67% of the US population and have a 75% enrollment rate in clinical trials and the Asian community makes up less than 6% of US population and have a 15% participation rate in clinical trials. Reported factors that have influenced Black\/African American clinical trials enrollment rates are little awareness of clinical trials, religious beliefs, and access to health care barriers. Improving clinical trial participation among African Americans\/African Nationals (AA\/AN) is essential to reduce cancer health disparities because it gives opportunity to increased access to breakthrough cancer therapies and treatments.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> To address these disparities, we composed an AA\/AN Clinical Trials manual to be distributed among these populations living in Los Angeles County (LAC). The AA\/AN manual modules review: 1) Intro to Clinical Trials 2) Demographics 3) Types of clinical trials 4) Phases of clinical trials 5) Safety of clinical trials 6) The role of faith among AA communities and 7) Life during and after clinical trials. There is also a Call to Action to share the manual information with friends and family, to talk with one&#8217;s primary care physician and get screened, and to participate in clinical trials. The manual was culturally and linguistically adapted to deliver lay messages on clinical trials as needed, using graphs, infographics, and educational videos featuring clinical trials cancer researchers and experts.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> 90 Churches in Los Angeles County serving AA\/AN communities have been provided with avirtual copy of the Clinical Trials manual to be disseminated among their communities. Additionally, have participated in 7 major community health events in LAC to outreach and engage African American community members at which we have distributed 822 hard copy clinical trials manuals between November of 2021 and November of 2022.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Involvement of faith-based communities in outreach and engagement strategies mayincrease cancer clinical trials participation among African American communities.

Etiological factors involved in hepatocarcinogenesis, which vary according to geographical location seem to play an important role in therapeutic efficacy. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer 2020 report, the combined percentage of total hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and biliary tract carcinoma (BTC) cases in the world was 72.3% from Asia, 9.9% from the Americas, 9.8% from Europe, 7.4% from Africa, and 0.5% from Oceania. We describe the regional accrual of multinational phase III liver cancer clinical trials in the last ten years.<br \/>Methods: We performed a database search in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science: Core Collection for multinational phase III clinical trials of HCC or BTC, studying first and second line treatments published in the last 10 years (08\/2012 - 08\/2022). Trials meeting these criteria were identified and the percentage of regional distribution was calculated.<br \/>Results: 17 multinational phase III clinical trials studying treatments for HCC and BTC were identified; 16 reported regional patient characteristics. The trials enrolled a total of 10,834 patients, of which 48.6% were from Asia, 17.1% from Europe, 8.5% from the Americas, 0.7% from Oceania, and 0.1% from Africa.

In 2020, Hispanic (Hisp) and Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) people constituted 19% and 14% of the U.S. population, respectively. As of 2019, Hisp and NHB proportionally made up 23.2% and 11.1% of hepatocellular carcinoma cases, respectively, and 22.6% and 8.3% of biliary tract cancer cases. We analyzed the enrollment of racial\/ethnic groups of liver cancer trials in the U.S in the last twenty years.<br \/>Methods: A database search was performed in clinicaltrials.gov for interventional liver cancer studies based only in the U.S. with reported results from 09\/2002-08\/2022. A total of 3492 trials were identified; studies were excluded if non-interventional (N=168), recruited in a foreign site (N= 2422), results were missing (N=713), or were not liver specific (N=63), resulting in a total of 126 studies. We sought to quantify the enrollment of racial\/ethnic subgroups.<br \/>Results: From a total of 126 studies, enrolling 5197 patients, 53.2% reported race\/ ethnicity; amongst these, 57.1% of patients were Non-Hispanic White, 14.5% were NHB, 9.9% were Hisp, 8.5% Asian, 0.4% American Indian and 0.2% Native Hawaiian\/Pacific Islander. NIH-funded studies had higher rates of race\/ethnicity reporting without reaching statistical significance (65.1% vs 47.0%, p= 0.053).

Overcoming these inequities requires a better understanding of the extent of such disparities across cancer types and medical interventions. Here, we studied the race and ethnicity of patients receiving tumor profiling for therapy decision support by examining real-world data (RWD) from 100,000 de-identified patient records across major cancer types. Tumors and normal tissue (when available) were sequenced with the Tempus xT assay, a 648-gene next-generation sequencing panel. Since race and ethnicity metadata are frequently incomplete in RWD, we imputed these categories from continental genetic ancestry inferred from genotypes of 654 ancestry informative markers obtained from sequencing data. Using a heuristic that combines East Asian, African, Amerindian, European, and South Asian ancestry proportions, we imputed Asian (A), Non-Hispanic Black (NHB), Hispanic\/Latino\/Native American (HIS), and Non-Hispanic White (NHW) categories with &#60;2% error rate (based on available metadata), leaving 3% of unclassified patients due to complex admixture. NHW patients are overrepresented in the cohort at 72% as compared to NHB (11%), HIS (9%) and ASN (5%). We compared the distributions of patients by race\/ethnicity categories across specific cancer types against the overall cohort race\/ethnicity distributions. These distributions were compared to the expected distribution under the null hypothesis of no relationship by the &#967;<sup>2<\/sup> test of independence. Significantly (p&#60;0.05) over\/under-represented categories in each cancer type were compared to ranks of incidence by race\/ethnicities in SEER program data at the national level. Differences are of a smaller magnitude in NHW as compared to the other races\/ethnicities. We observed several differences that are concordant with SEER; for example, overrepresentations of NHB in breast, colorectal, and endometrial cancers, which correspond to high incidences of these cancers for NHB. Notably, we observed several discordances with SEER incidence rate ranks, including underrepresentation of NHB in pancreatic and urinary tract cancers, underrepresentation of NHW in breast and colorectal cancers, overrepresentation of ASN in gallbladder and biliary cancer, and overrepresentation of HIS in colorectal cancer. These differences can be the result of a complex interplay of factors, such as stage of the disease at sequencing, access to early-stage curative therapies, comorbidities\/cofactors, access to care, insurance, socioeconomic status, and others. Nonetheless, our results show that analysis of racial disparities can be performed with RWD, and this information can be useful in studying causes and devising strategies to improve healthcare equity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Race,Precision medicine,Global Health,Mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Francisco M.

In this study we develop a genetic ancestry pipeline for the Cancer Genomics Cloud, which we use to assess the diversity of models currently available in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) supported PDX Development and Trial Centers Research Network (PDXNet). We show that there is an over-representation of models derived from patients of European ancestry, which is consistent with other cancer model resources. We discuss these findings in the context of disparities in cancer incidence and outcomes among demographic groups in the US. For example, for the top cancer health disparities affecting African Americans and Latinos, there is a significant lack of ethnic\/race appropriate models needed to advance pre-clinical research and personalized clinical treatment. For stomach and liver tumors, which represent disparities in these two minority populations, there are only three available models derived from patients from such backgrounds. Fortunately, ongoing NCI-funded efforts in minority focused PDXNet centers are actively addressing these gaps. We further discuss these results in the context of power analyses to highlight the immediate need for the development of models from minority populations to address cancer health equity in personalized medicine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,Bioinformatics,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Brian  J.

However, potential clinical and genomic factors contributing to this disparity have yet to be elucidated. Using clinically annotated genomic data from 501 LSCC tumor samples in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we compared clinical data, gene expression profiles, mutations, and focal and arm-level copy number changes from tumors across ancestral groups to identify significantly differential events. Within this dataset, patients of AFR ancestry had worse survival and progression-free survival then patients of EUR ancestry. We applied the Cox Proportional Hazards model to predict overall and progression-free survival as functions of genetic ancestry alongside other genetic, molecular, and clinical variables. We found a significant difference in metastatic stage between tumors from patients of African (AFR) and European (EUR) ancestry, which was significant in predicting survival. Compared to tumors from EUR patients, tumors from AFR patients featured increased chromosome arm 8q gain and more frequent amplification of genetic locus chr8q24, which contains proto-oncogene MYC. Expression of MYC target genes was also significantly increased in AFR samples relative to EUR samples. These findings may suggest a role for the MYC pathway in differential cancer progression. We found more frequent amplification of genetic loci chr22q11 and chr16p11 in AFR samples compared to EUR samples. We identified top differentially mutated genes between groups, of which SPRR3, PDGFA, FRS3, and C21orf62 correlate with survival. We also found immune signaling gene sets enriched in the EUR group by gene set expression analysis (GSEA). These results suggest potential genetic and clinical factors implicated in racial survival disparities. Further studies and more diverse sampling of cancer patient populations are required to validate these differences and elucidate patient-specific treatment modalities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Squamous cell carcinoma,Survival,Race,Myc,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sejal Jain<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Alexandria  G.

Blacks\/African Americans (B\/AA) have higher tobacco-related morbidity and mortality than Whites\/European Americans (W\/EA), despite smoking fewer cigarettes and starting later in life. COPD is a well-established risk factor for LC and B\/AA develop COPD with less cumulative smoking and at younger ages. We will test the hypothesis that NRF2 and Focal Adhesion-PI3K-Akt-mTOR-signaling pathways play a significant role in the disparities observed between B\/AA and W\/EA with LC and COPD and that account for worsened outcomes in B\/AA.<br \/>Methods: RNAseq analysis was conducted on tissues from 30 LC patients and 29 COPD patients undergoing lung transplantation. We compared both LC and COPD RNAseq data to identify common and unique transcripts associated with each disease.<br \/>Results: A total of 153 genes were significantly upregulated in COPD compared to LC adeno carcinoma and 174 LC squamous cell carcinoma. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed the involvement of top regulator networks with the activation of EPSA1, CTNNB1, EP300, IKBKB and IL1B which are seen in both LC and COPD and may be involved in COPD progression to LC. We further analyzed the transcriptome of COPD between B\/AA and W\/EA and identified 141 significantly upregulated genes in B\/AAs. We further validated our findings in TCGA B\/AA LC patients to determine the extent of overlap between COPD and LC. Among these, 42 (29.8%) and 13 (9.2%) genes were significantly upregulated in TCGA LC adenocarcinoma (58 B\/AA patients vs 527 from other races) and LC squamous cell carcinoma cohorts (32 B\/AA patients vs 518 from other races), respectively. Survival analysis using the upregulated genes from the TCGA LC B\/AA cohorts showed a higher expression of three LC adenocarcinoma (TOMM5, CEP-152 and HGS) and two LC squamous cell carcinoma specific genes (PYROXD2 and USP43) significantly associated with overall survival.<br \/>Conclusion: Our data provide novel insight on the overlap between COPD and LC and identified potential pathways that may be contributing to the significant health care disparity among B\/AAs. Future studies are warranted to identify early-stage COPD markers that could be used for identification of high-risk individuals that would benefit from therapeutic interventions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Race,Early detection,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Prevention,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jose Thomas Thaiparambil<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Zheng Yin<sup><\/sup>, Randa El-Zein<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8d411189-9d2e-4ff3-b332-d33f3dd8348b","ControlNumber":"3928","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

The prevalence of KRAS G12C co-mutations in NH vs Hispanic was 9.3% vs 5.7%. Median age of NH vs Hispanic patients was 69.5 yrs vs 66.4 yrs. (Table1) In both the NH and Hispanic cohorts, there were more women (56% vs 51.5%), as well as smokers (97% vs 97%). In both cohorts, most patients had non-squamous histology (94%). In the NH cohort, the majority were PDL1 negative (50%). In the Hispanic cohort, there was a more even distribution of PDL1 expression status: negative (30%), low (33%), and high (24%). Median DOR for chemotherapy in NH vs Hispanics was 16 mos vs 14 mos (p=0.77). Median DOR for immunotherapy in NH vs Hispanics was 18 mos vs 12 mos (p=0.30). Median OS in NH vs Hispanics was 36 mos vs 29 mos (p=0.25).<br \/>Conclusion: There was no statistical difference in prevalence of KRAS G12C mutations between NH and Hispanics. Notably, both cohorts had a significant smoking history. KRAS G12C portends equally poor prognosis and treatment resistance as evidenced by median DOR and OS for both Hispanics and NH patients. However, Hispanic patients demonstrated a trend of decreased OS and DOR to IO compared to NH patients.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\"

We explored the relationship between socioeconomic status and lung cancer incidence across world regions, using educational level as a proxy for socioeconomic status.<br \/>Methods: We analyzed the harmonized database of the Lung Cancer Cohort Consortium (LC3). The current study included data from 18 prospective cohorts from 15 countries in the US, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Separately for participants who never or currently\/formerly smoked, we estimated the association between educational level and incident lung cancer using Cox proportional hazards models. Information on education was harmonized using the International Standard Classification of Education and then modeled as an ordinal variable in 4 categories. Models were adjusted for age, sex, and for participants who currently\/formerly smoked, smoking duration, cigarettes per day, and time since cessation.<br \/>Results: Among 2.6 million participants from 15 countries, 62,645 developed lung cancer during follow-up (median follow-up = 12.6 years). Among current\/former smokers, increased educational level was associated with decreased lung cancer incidence in most cohorts after adjustment for age, sex, and detailed smoking information, with HRs ranging from 0.77 (95%CI: 0.42-1.41) per 1-unit increase in educational level in the Iranian Golestan Cohort Study to 1.02 (95%CI: 0.95-1.09) in the Australian Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study. When grouping by world region, the association between education and lung cancer incidence among currently\/formerly smoking participants was similar for the US (HR<sub>pooled<\/sub>=0.88, 95%CI: 0.87-0.89), Europe (HR<sub>pooled<\/sub>=0.89, 95%CI: 0.88-0.91), and Asia (HR<sub>pooled<\/sub>=0.91, 95%CI: 0.86-0.96), but attenuated in the Australian cohort (HR=1.02, 95%CI: 0.95-1.09). Among never smokers, after adjustment for age and sex, there was no statistically significant association between educational level and lung cancer incidence (p-trend&#62;0.05 in all cohorts), with the exception of the US Southern Community Cohort Study, which comprises primarily African-Americans and showed a HR of 0.75 (95%CI: 0.62-0.90).<br \/>Conclusion: Among currently and formerly smoking individuals, higher educational level showed a strikingly consistent decreased risk of incident lung cancer across cohorts from 4 continents, after detailed adjustment for smoking. In contrast, among people who never smoked, there was no association between education and lung cancer incidence in any cohort, with the exception of the Southern Community Cohort Study. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms, either related or unrelated to smoking, that contribute to the association between education and lung cancer risk.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Incidence,Smoking,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Justina  U.

These data included tumor characteristics, demographics, and county of residence of cases. We abstracted county-level socioeconomic variables from the American Community Survey (ACS), county-level smoking prevalence from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), and county-level healthcare resource data from the Area Health Resource File (AHRF). The binary outcome was stage at diagnosis (distant versus localized or regional). The predictors were age category at diagnosis, sex, race\/ethnicity available for individual cases, and county-level variables. We used a multilevel mixed effects analysis to assess the correlates of patient-level and county-level factors on stage at diagnosis of oral cancer in cases diagnosed between 2010 and 2016 from 612 counties.<br \/>Results: Among 54,099 patients diagnosed with oral cancer, 10954 (20.25%) had distant-stage disease. Multivariable analysis showed statistical difference in distant versus localized or regional stage at diagnosis between non-Hispanic Whites and Non-Hispanic Blacks (odds ratio [OR]: 1.872, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.743 - 2.0), Asians (OR: 1.762, 95% CI: 1.619 - 1.917), and Hispanics (OR: 1.380, 95% CI: 1.274 - 1.495), and between females and males (OR: 1.348, 95% CI: 1.282 - 1.427). The proportion of patients with distant stage disease also increased significantly with increasing age. In addition to patient-level characteristics, some county-level factors were also associated with distant stage at diagnosis. The proportion of patients with distant stage disease was significantly higher in counties with above-median percentage of foreign-born residents (OR: 1.157, 95% CI: 1.011 - 1.323) and above-median prevalence of ever smokers (OR: 1.123, 95% CI: 1.022 - 1.233). Of 2.18% total variability in stage at diagnosis, 0.4% was accounted for by patient-level characteristics and 0.32% by county-level characteristics, leaving 1.46% unexplained variation.<br \/>Conclusion: We see significant roles of county-level smoking and foreign-born status on the risk of distant stage at diagnosis of oral cancer.

The purpose of the study was to examine incidence and 5-years relative survival rates for persistent poverty counties versus non-persistent poverty counties by race\/ethnicity and sex. Methods Data on county-level cancer incidence and 5-year relative survival came from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), accessed through SEER*Stat. Analysis was based on data obtained from the SEER database linked to 2010-2018 American Community Survey (ACS) data. Persistent poverty is defined by census tracts as being persistently poor if 20% or more of the population has lived below the poverty level for a period spanning about 30 years based on ACS. Age-adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated by comparing living in the persistent poverty counties to living in the non-persistent poverty counties by sex, separately for each race\/ethnic group (non-Hispanic (NH)-White, NH-Black, Hispanic, NH-Asian\/Pacific Islander). Results We identified 105,103 patients with oral and pharynx cancer diagnosed from 2009-2018. The majority were male (70.5%), NH-White (76.1%), and diagnosed with oral cancers (64.8%). There was a significant trend of higher incidence in counties with persistent poverty for NH-Blacks (IRR persistent poverty vs. non-persistent poverty counties: 1.46, 95 % CI 1.39-1.53; p-value &#60;0.0001) and NH-Whites (IRR poverty vs. non-persistent poverty counties: 1.12, 95 % CI 1.08-1.16; p-value &#60;0.0001), while Hispanics had lower incidence (IRR persistent poverty vs. non-persistent poverty counties: 0.91, 95 % CI 0.85-0.98; p-value &#60;0.001), and there was no association among NH-Asian\/PI patients. Stratifying by sex, NH-Black, NH-White, NH-Asian\/PI males, and NH-Black females in persistent poverty had significantly higher IRRs; while Hispanics in persistent poverty counties had lower IRRs compared to non-persistent counties. The overall 5-year relative survival among NH-Blacks was lower in persistent poverty counties 41.0% [standard error (SE)=1.4] compared to 54.1% (SE=1.0) in non-persistent poverty counties; NH-Whites in persistent poverty counties also had lower survival rates of 55.1% (SE=1.2) compared to 69.6% (SE=0.3) in non-persistent poverty counties. Similar survival rates were seen among the NH-Asian\/PI and Hispanics. Conclusion<br \/>Oral and pharynx incidence and 5-year survival rates were worse among patients living in persistent poverty counties, suggesting the necessity for multilevel research to reduce disparities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Race\/Ethnicity,Incidence and Survival rates,Persistent poverty,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shama  D.

For White individuals, increases in European ancestry were associated with increased death risk, (HR=1.009 per 1% increase in European ancestry, 95%CI:1.003-1.015, p=0.002). HRs for European ancestry, by quartile, were 1.040, 1.061 and 1.063, with the last two HRs demonstrating statistical significance (95%CI:1.0018-1.106, p = 0.005, and 95%CI:1.020-1.108, p=0.004), respectively. For Black individuals, increases in African ancestry were associated with increased death risk, (HR=1.003 per 1% increase in African ancestry, 95%CI: 0.998-1.008, p=0.214), although not statistically significant. HRs for African ancestry, by quartile, were 1, 1.16, 1.14, and 1.21, with the last HR demonstrating statistical significance (95%CI:1.010-1.450, p = 0.03).<br \/>Conclusions: For self-reported White individuals who ever-smoked, increasing European ancestry was associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk. For self-reported Black individuals who ever-smoked, there was suggestive evidence that increasing African ancestry may increase all-cause mortality risk. However, associations with ancestry were small and may be vulnerable to residual confounding.<br \/>Impact\/Significance: A mechanistic explanation for this finding is unclear, but it could be related to population genetic &#8220;fitness&#8221; with reduced genetic admixture leading to decreased fitness for survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,cancer risk prediction,genetic ancestry,all-cancer mortality,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Courtney D.

It is unclear which exposures and biochemical pathways may explain this racial disparity. We examined the metabolomic profiles of prostate cancer risk by race within a subset of studies from the COnsortium of METabolomics Studies (COMETS). A meta-analysis of six cohort-based studies including 1,769 prostate cancer case-control sets and 831 serum metabolites was conducted using the multivariable logistic regression and random effects models. Overall, 11 metabolites were significantly associated with prostate cancer risk, including L-cystine (1-SD OR=0.77; P=0.009) and biliverdin (1-SD OR=1.12; P=0.017). The race-stratified analysis of chemical classes revealed that lipids were positively associated with prostate cancer risk only in White men, whereas amino acids were associated inversely primarily in Black men. The latter included metabolites related to tryptophan, lysine, and phenylalanine metabolism; e.g., the strongest metabolite being alpha-N-phenylacetyl-L-glutamine (1-SD OR=0.81; P=0.003), which is produced by Clostridial anaerobic bacteria in the gut. Lipids related to fatty acid metabolism were associated with higher prostate cancer risk in both Black and White men (e.g., docosahexaenoylcholine and 3-hydroxybutyroylglycine), and alpha-tocopherol was inversely associated in White men (1-SD OR=0.69; P=0.011). For other races combined, N-acetyltryptophan (1-SD OR=0.04; P=0.025) showed the strongest metabolite-risk association. To our knowledge, this is the first metabolomic meta-analysis of prostate cancer risk which provides evidence of biochemical etiologic differences relevant to the Black-White disease disparity.<br \/>Table 1.

The pursuit of therapeutic strategies that incorporate tailored medicine for AA men remains a paramount goal.<i> <\/i>Metastatic PCa initially responds to suppression of androgen signaling through standard-of-care androgen deprivation therapy. However, relapse is inevitable, and treatment options are limited. For this reason, inhibiting androgen-independent signaling pathways that promote metastasis &#8212;such as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) signaling&#8212; is a promising area of investigation. HER2 overexpression in PCa tumors correlates with worse prognosis and treatment-resistance, but HER2 overexpression has not been evaluated specifically in AA men. We hypothesize<b> <\/b>that HER2 overexpression correlates with West African genetic ancestry (WAA) in AA PCa patients and worsens clinical features, treatment response, and survival outcomes. In this study, we report that <i>HER2\/ERBB2 <\/i>is upregulated in the majority of PCa tumors in the Oncomine database. We quantified <i>HER2\/ERBB2<\/i> with RNAseq analysis of prostate tissue samples collected from AA patients (n=36) and observed a moderate correlation with WAA determined by genotyping using a validated set of Ancestry Informative Markers. Using immunohistochemistry, we also observed detectable HER2 protein expression in primary prostate tumors of AA patients (n=10). Our observation that 30% of AA primary tumor tissue samples were HER2-positive is remarkable, especially as previous studies have reported that HER2 overexpression is directly associated with metastasis as opposed to early, localized tumors. Our findings may underscore a basal\/increased predisposition for HER2 overexpression in the AA population. We also detected <i>HER2\/ERBB2 <\/i>mRNA<i> <\/i>expression using qPCR in a racially diverse panel of commonly used PCa cell lines: AA (MDA-PCa-2b and RC-77T\/E) and non-Hispanic white (PC3, DU145, 22Rv1). To determine the effect of HER2 blockade on cell viability, we treated cells with 20 nM of anti-HER2 drug Trastuzumab for 72 hours and performed CellTiter-Glo&#8482; assays. The only cell lines with significantly reduced viability were the AA cell lines. Furthermore, the RC-77T\/E cell line which had the highest expression of <i>HER2\/ERBB2 <\/i>also had the most significant reduction in cell viability. This finding suggests that AAs may be more responsive to HER2-targeting drugs, and that this responsiveness may be increased in PCa patients with higher levels of HER2 overexpression. It is plausible that HER2 overexpression may occur at earlier disease stages in AA men than previously reported and could be utilized to characterize aggressive PCa tumors eligible for HER2-targeting inhibitors, thus providing an early and effective therapeutic intervention that may improve outcomes in this population and reduce this appreciable health disparity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HER2\/neu,African American,Prostate cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nicole Ursula  R.

African American men (AAM) have higher rates of PCa incidence and mortality compared with European American men (EAM). While socioeconomics, access to optimal care and life-style factors contribute towards these disparities, underlying biologic differences in AAM remain important drivers of PCa disparities. In the current work, we aimed to explore the interplay between oxidative stress and inflammatory signaling in promoting progression of PCa in AAM. Oxidative stress results from excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated mainly via membrane bound oxidases, peroxisomes or the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). We performed a robust comparative genomics to determine whether there is a race dependent expression of genes related to ROS in publicly available PCa datasets. We then prospectively examined the differential gene expression of these genesets in PCa from clinically matched AAM and EAM in the VANDAAM prospective study. VANDAAM is a validation study of Decipher<sup>TM<\/sup> genomic testing in 243 men with localized PCa. We then combined computational and experimental approaches to explore the molecular mechanisms and consequences of exacerbated oxidative stress. We found that ETC complex I, III related genes are the most differentially expressed in AAM compared with EAM. To examine whether AAM vs EAM cell lines exhibits differential sensitivity to ETC modulation, we blocked key ETC enzymes using complex I inhibitor, rotenone, and complex III inhibitor, antimycin A. We used 2 types of mitochondria-specific labels that distinguish respiring and ROS-generating mitochondria. While the relative levels of respiring mitochondria remain constant, we found that antimycin A induced higher level of mitochondrial ROS in AAM PCa cell lines compared with EAM PCa cell lines. To understand the interplay between mitochondrial ETC complex I &#38; III and immune microenvironment, we computed the correlational discordance of ETC complex I &#38; III expression scores and expression of &#62;1200 immune-related genes between AAM vs EAM in VANDAAM cohort<b>.<\/b> These analyses suggest that ETC complex I &#38; III correlate with several immunosuppressive genes including the macrophage markers CD68 and CD163 and T cell exhaustion markers. In addition, intersecting discordant genes from several datasets suggests enrichment of inflammatory cytokines and type I interferon signature which we then validated using ex vivo culture of PCa tissues. In summary, we discovered a role of mitochondrial electron transport chain in regulating inflammatory circuits in PCa of AAM. Unraveling roles of mitochondria in promoting immune suppression will have significant impact on understanding the intersection between social pressures and biological stress responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-04 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitochondria,Metabolism,Disparity,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Asmaa El-Kenawi<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Ryan Putney<sup><\/sup>, Shivanshu Awasthi<sup><\/sup>, Amparo Serna<sup><\/sup>, Corrado Caslini<sup><\/sup>, Jasreman Dhillon<sup><\/sup>, Kosj Yamoah<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7298d1ce-ed9b-4d98-bfd6-fe57d2f1a71f","ControlNumber":"219","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.
