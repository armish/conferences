[{"Abstract":"The Notch signaling pathway, particularly endothelial Notch signaling, plays a key role in tumor formation and angiogenesis. Inhibiting Notch1 or its ligand, Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4), can induce hypersprouting of the tumor vasculature and thus can reduce tumor perfusion and progression. However, due to the expression of Notch1 in multiple healthy cell types, pharmacologic blockade poses the challenge of inducing tissue hypoxia, vascular neoplasms, and toxicity in non-target tissues. Unlike Notch1, Notch4 expression is largely restricted to endothelium and is upregulated in models of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Loss of Notch4 in mice results in delayed developmental angiogenesis and reduced mammary tumor angiogenesis and perfusion. Therefore, Notch4 is an attractive potential pharmacologic target to interfere with tumorigenesis and minimize nonspecific toxicity.<br \/>We determined that Notch4 is expressed primarily in tumor endothelium in both human and mouse mammary tumors, including murine syngeneic Py8119 tumors, as well as a selection of other human and syngeneic mouse tumor types such as B16F10 melanoma tumors.<br \/>We explored the effects of Notch4 inhibition on the progression of murine mammary epithelial carcinoma using newly developed anti-Notch4 antibodies, 6-3-A6 and its humanized derivative E7011. Administration of E7011 or 6-3-A6 to orthotopically implanted Py8119 murine breast carcinoma and B16F10 melanoma significantly reduced tumor size in comparison to IgG-treated controls. We performed single cell RNA sequencing of Py8119 tumors treated with E7011 and found that although Notch4 transcripts were found specifically in the endothelium, the most notable effect of E7011 was a dramatic increase in the number of macrophages and cancer-associated fibroblasts, suggesting a non-cell autonomous effect.<br \/>To examine the potential role of these immune cell population changes in facilitating E7011&#8217;s anti-tumor activity, we investigated treatment of Py8119 murine mammary carcinomas in the absence of macrophages. Administration of clodronate liposomes to eliminate macrophages blocked the anti-tumor effects of E7011 treatment. Taken together, our data suggests that tumor endothelial Notch4 promotes TNBC growth by altering the immune landscape and increasing anti-tumor macrophage recruitment, and that blockade via the novel anti-Notch4 E7011 antibody has potential therapeutic efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-01 Antireceptors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Notch,Antiangiogenic agents,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Jason W.

In the current study, we deciphered the effects of LY6K on transforming growth factor-&#946; (TGF-&#946;) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling through clathrin- and caveolin-1 (CAV-1)-mediated endocytosis. LY6K expression level is elevated in higher grade cervical cancer patients correlating with poor overall survival, progression-free survival, and disease-free survival. LY6K-depletion in HeLa and SiHa cancer cells suppressed EGF-induced proliferation and TGF-&#946;-enhanced migration and invasion. Both TGF-&#946; receptor-I (T&#946;RI) and EGF receptor (EGFR) localized at the plasma membrane regardless of LY6K expression, and LY6K bound T&#946;RI irrespective of the presence of TGF-&#946;; however, LY6K did not bind EGFR. LY6K-depleted cells showed impaired SMAD2 phosphorylation upon TGF-&#946; treatment and lower proliferation rates following long-term treatment with EGF. We revealed the atypical movement of T&#946;RI and EGFR from plasma membrane upon ligand stimulation in LY6K-depleted cells and an impaired movement of the endocytic proteins clathrin and CAV-1. Subsequently, transmission electron microscopy showed no clathrin and CAV-1-coated vesicles in LY6K-depleted cells. Our study demonstrates the key role of LY6K in both clathrin- and CAV-1-mediated endocytic pathways regulated by TGF-&#946; and EGF, and it suggests a correlation between LY6K overexpression in cervical cancer cells and poor overall survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Signal transduction pathways,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Young Yang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sujeong Park<\/i><\/presenter>.

These proteins are over-expressed in a number of different solid tumor indications including ovarian, endometrial, gastric, pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancers. As a result of the highly restricted normal tissue expression and over-expression in cancer, ALPP and ALPPL2 are attractive targets for antibody and protein-drug conjugate (ADC and PDC) approaches. The recent initiation of a Phase I clinical trial utilizing a full-length antibody ADC has fueled further interest in these oncology targets. Small protein domain binders, which have the capacity to penetrate deeper into solid tumors and can be engineered into multiple therapeutic formats in a modular fashion,<i> <\/i>offer a number of potential benefits over full-length antibodies as the targeting vehicle in PDC therapeutics. We report the identification and characterization of a series of high affinity ALPP\/ALPPL2 specific single domain VHH binders which, importantly, show no binding to the closely related ALPI or ALPL isoforms (which have high normal tissue expression). Through application of the Almac Discovery PDC technology platform, these VHH domains have been reformatted into a suite of homogenous site-specifically labelled drug conjugates, with defined drug to antibody ratios, in high yields. These conjugates, which are based on mono- and bi-paratopic Fc fusion formats, employ both clinically established and novel linker-toxin combinations. In pre-clinical studies, the lead bi-paratopic PDCs were well tolerated <i>in vivo<\/i> and showed excellent anti-tumor efficacy in ALPP\/ALPPL2 positive cell-line derived xenograft models of gastric and pancreatic carcinoma, with sustained regressions still observed 10 weeks after administration of the final dose of agent. These agents have physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties suitable for further development and we anticipate that the excellent pre-clinical efficacy profile of lead PDCs will translate to a highly differentiated product for the treatment of a variety of solid tumor indications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),ALPP \/ ALPPL2,Solid tumors,Targeted drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Graham Cotton<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Trumper<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Estelle McLean<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Wappett<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stacey Bell<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Greg Papadakos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer Thom<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chiara Saladino<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron Cranston<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Georgiana Parau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie Gatdula<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie Burton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aidan McCann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tim Harrison<\/i><\/presenter>.

Claudin-1 (CLDN1), a member of the tight junction family, is a transmembrane protein mediating cell stemness, plasticity and signaling. The functional role of CLDN1 as a therapeutic target for CCA is unknown. We have previously developed highly specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) targeting exposed non-junctional CLDN1 exhibiting an excellent safety profile in non-human primates (Roehlen, Saviano et al. Science Translational Medicine 2022). Here, we aimed to explore the role of CLDN1 as an oncogenic driver and therapeutic target for CCA.<br \/>Methods: Comprehensive CLDN1 expression analyses in patient tissues were performed to evaluate CLDN1 as a therapeutic target. Proof-of-concept studies using CLDN1 mAbs were performed in state-of-the-art mouse CDX and PDX models including models for advanced metastatic disease. Single-cell RNA sequencing and proteomics were applied to investigate tumor cell fate and signaling in vivo and ex vivo models.<br \/>Results: Comprehensive analyses of CLDN1 protein and RNA expression in CCA patient tissues revealed a marked and significant upregulation of CLDN1 in CCA. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the CCA microenvironment revealed strong expression in tumor cells showing EMT, cell cycle and interferon response signature, uncovering CLDN1 as a therapeutic target. Targeting exposed CLDN1 by highly specific mAbs resulted in a significant and robust antitumoral effect in vivo across CDX and PDX models for intra- and extrahepatic CCA including advanced metastatic disease. Functional studies in cell-based models of CCA showed that CLDN1 mAbs markedly and significantly suppressed migration and invasion of tumor cells. Mechanistically, treatment with CLDN1 mAb suppressed Notch1, Src, and Hippo-YAP signaling - key signal transduction pathways implicated in CCA development and progression.<br \/>Conclusion: Collectively, these results support an important functional role for CLDN1 in CCA pathogenesis and provide robust pre-clinical proof-of-concept for CLDN1-specific mAbs to treat CCA, setting the stage for its clinical development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-03 Growth factor receptors and other surface antigens as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Therapeutic target,Cholangiocarcinoma,Claudin-1 ,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Marion Muller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zeina Nehme<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Emilie Crouchet<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank Jühling<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natascha Röhlen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrick Pessaux<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Emanuele Felli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lipika Goyal<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Markus Meyer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roberto Iacone<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alberto Toso<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luigi Manenti<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patrice Laquerriere<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aïna Venkatasamy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nabeel Bardeesy<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Catherine Schuster<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laurent Mailly<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas F.

Recent findings in the field have improved the clinical outcomes for only a subset of patients who are responsive to immunotherapy or have targetable oncogenic drivers. We have previously showed that concomitant loss of Serine\/Threonine Kinase 11 (<i>STK11<\/i>) and Kelch-like ECH Associated Protein1 (<i>KEAP1<\/i>) detected in up to 10% NSCLC cases, dramatically enhances cell proliferation and invasion <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Bulk RNA sequencing identified upregulation of genes involved in ferroptosis, which is an iron dependent form of programmed cell death, in <i>STK11\/KEAP1 <\/i>double mutant models, nominating ferroptosis as a potential vulnerability in these tumors. However, the mechanism of ferroptosis evasion in this subset in not well understood.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We performed an <i>in vitro<\/i> CRISPR screen in <i>STK11\/KEAP1<\/i> co-mutant, single mutant and wild type cell lines. To further characterize the role of ferroptosis regulators in <i>STK11\/KEAP1<\/i> co-mutant setting, we performed phospho-kinase arrays and RNA sequencing in <i>STK11\/KEAP1<\/i> cell lines followed by validation through western blotting. Additionally, we performed gene expression analysis in patient derived xenografts (PDX) models treated with the SCD inhibitor to further characterize the mechanisms by which SCD inhibition has synthetic lethal effects in <i>STK11\/KEAP1<\/i> co-mutant background.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>CRISPR\/Cas9 based genetic screening identified stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), a gene involved in ferroptosis protection, as a potential therapeutic target in the <i>STK11\/KEAP1<\/i> double mutant tumors. We further demonstrate that SCD overexpression protects <i>STK11\/KEAP1<\/i> co-mutant NSCLCs from undergoing ferroptosis. Pharmacological inhibition of SCD significantly reduced viability of STK11\/KEAP1 co-mutant NSCLCs and made the co-mutant cells sensitive to ferroptosis induction. Phospho-kinase array showed downregulation of JAK-STAT and AKT signaling, in <i>STK11\/KEAP1<\/i> co-mutant NSCLCs as compared to both <i>STK11<\/i> and <i>KEAP1<\/i> single mutant isogenic conditions. The downregulation of these pathways was confirmed by gene expression profiling. To further understand the role of SCD in regulating ferroptosis we are studying the effect of concurrent loss of STK11 and KEAP1 on SCD on lipid oxidizing capacity and ferroptosis in a comprehensive panel of NSCLC cell lines and testing whether ferroptosis protection due to SCD overexpression leads to enhanced tumorigenesis in this co-mutant subtype of NSCLC <i>in vivo<\/i> and <i>in vitro<\/i>.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Our study demonstrates the biological differences between <i>STK11\/KEAP1<\/i> co-mutant NSCLC as compared to the single mutants or wildtype counterparts in a KRAS mutation agnostic manner.

Through 4EBP1 and S6K, the mTORC1 complex regulates translation of oncogenes including MYC. The <i>MYC<\/i> oncogene is causally involved in the pathogenesis of many human cancers but remains as a challenging therapeutic target. Experimentally, inhibiting <i>MYC<\/i> results in tumor regression associated with immune reactivation. Several lines of evidence suggest that inhibition of the mTORC1 pathway may result in synthetic lethality of MYC-driven cancers. However, to date, existing mTOR pathway inhibitors such as everolimus or sapanisertib fail to sufficiently decrease MYC protein levels <i>in vivo <\/i>because of incomplete inhibition of p4EBP1 or toxicities that limit the activity, respectively. Revolution Medicines has developed third-generation bi-steric selective mTORC1 inhibitors with a rapamycin-like core moiety covalently linked to an mTOR active-site inhibitor. RMC-5552, a representative of the bi-steric class of selective mTORC1 inhibitor, is currently in Phase 1 clinical trials (NCT04774952). Here, we show this new class of inhibitors suppresses both S6K and 4EBP1 phosphorylation and depletes MYC protein expression <i>in vivo<\/i> in an autochthonous conditional transgenic mouse model of<i> MYC<\/i>-driven HCC and across several human patient-derived xenograft models with MYC amplification. Furthermore, bi-steric mTORC1-selective inhibitors restore anti-tumor immune surveillance and synergize with &#945;-PD-1 immune checkpoint therapy in the<i> MYC<\/i>-driven HCC mouse model. Overall, we provide proof-of-principle that selective mTORC1 pharmacological inhibition can effectively target<i> MYC<\/i>-driven cancers by reducing MYC levels, combine with immune checkpoint inhibition, re-establish anti-tumor immunity, and induce sustained tumor regression in the preclinical setting. These preclinical findings provide a rationale for clinical trials with selective mTORC1 inhibitors in patients with MYC-driven cancers and moreover, support clinical testing of combination with immune checkpoint inhibition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myc,mTOR,Immune checkpoint blockade,Antitumor activity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Wadie D.

Deregulation of &#946;-catenin occurs frequently in several cancer types by mutation or overexpression of the &#946;-catenin gene or mutation of negative regulators such as Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC). ST316 is a novel peptide antagonist that specifically interferes with the association of &#946;-catenin with its co-activator BCL9, disrupting &#946;-catenin nuclear localization and attenuating target gene expression. In an orthotopic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) model, ST316 demonstrates potent anti-tumor activity, resulting in 84% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) (p&#60;0.001 vs. vehicle control). In addition to its cell-autonomous mechanisms, deregulated Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling can promote tumorigenesis by impacting the tumor microenvironment. Reprogramming of immunosuppressive M2-like Tumor Associated Macrophages (TAMs) toward an immune-promoting program (M1-like) is an attractive cancer immunotherapeutic strategy. Here we explored ST316 potential for macrophage repolarization toward the M1-like phenotype, activation of cytotoxic T-cells in macrophage\/T-cell co-culture assays and cooperation of ST316 with anti-PD-1 to enhance anti-tumor activity in vivo. Initial studies demonstrate that human macrophages derived from Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (hPBMCs) and subsequently committed to the M2-like identity are reprogrammed toward an M1-like phenotype upon ST316 exposure. ST316 treatment dose-dependently suppressed expression of the M2 marker CD163 by flow cytometry and quantitative PCR, resulting in 100-fold increase in the M1\/M2 ratio without substantial impact on cell viability. Importantly, T-cell viability and activation markers associated with M1-state (CD80, CD86) were not affected by ST316 at the concentrations used in these studies. Further, in co-cultures of M2 macrophage with T cells, ST316 exposure resulted in a three-fold increase in T-cell activation compared to control M2\/T cell co-cultures, as measured by intracellular IFN-&#947; staining. Finally, in an orthotopic TNBC model in vivo, subtherapeutic ST316 enhanced the anti-tumor activity of anti-PD-1 [85% TGI with combination, compared to 51% TGI with anti-PD1 alone (p&#60;0.01) and -9% TGI with subtherapeutic ST316 alone (p&#60;0.001)]. Anti-tumor activity was accompanied by an increase the M1\/M2 ratio. Overall, these results support the immuno-therapeutic potential of ST316 and extend the application range of ST316 to include Wnt-driven cancers with poor clinical response to immune checkpoint blockade and other immunotherapeutic agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"&#946;-catenin,Macrophages,Peptides,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Claudio Scuoppo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lila Ghamsari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erin Gallagher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Siok Leong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Koester<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rick Ramirez<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jerel Gonzales<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gene Merutka<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Barry Kappel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Abi Vainstein-Haras<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jim Rotolo<\/i><\/presenter>.

Melanoma can be fatal if not surgically removed at an early stage, with the 5-year survival being a dismal 29.8% for a stage IV melanoma. Melanoma mortality is primarily due to the distant organ metastases and its resistance to treatment, even with newly developed immunotherapy and\/or targeted therapies (BRAF and MEK inhibitors). Thus, the discovery of novel melanoma targets is crucial as they may be able to provide alternative treatment options or be used alone or in combination with current therapies. KIFC1 (kinesin family member C1; also known as HSET, an ortholog in <i>Drosophila melanogaster<\/i>), a nonessential kinesin motor protein, has an established role in centrosome clustering which is utilized by cancer cells to evade apoptosis and mitotic arrest. This occurs when replicating cells harbor additional centrosomes, a hallmark of cancer. The requirement of KIFC1 in mitosis of cancer cells harboring abnormal centrosomes, but not that of normal cells, makes it a potential drug target for cancer management. The goal of this study was to determine the role and significance of KIFC1 in melanoma. Differential expression analysis of GTEX and TCGA RNA-seq data identified significantly higher levels of KIFC1 in both primary and metastatic melanoma as compared to normal skin. In addition, higher expression of KIFC1 was found to be associated with poorer overall survival of melanoma patients. Furthermore, a quantitative protein estimation with the automated ProteinSimple Jess capillary western blotting system demonstrated higher KIFC1 expression in several melanoma cell lines when compared to normal melanocytes. In addition, we also found significantly increased expression of KIFC1 mRNA in mouse melanoma tumors obtained from the genetically engineered <i>Braf<sup>V600E<\/sup>\/Pten<sup>NULL<\/sup><\/i> mice, as compared to the normal skin. Next, we determined the effect of a small molecule KIFC1 inhibitor, AZ82 on A375, G361 and Hs294T melanoma cells. AZ82 is an ATP-competitive inhibitor that binds the KIFC1-microtubule complex, blocking the release of ADP and negating its role as a motor protein. Employing RealTime-Glo MT cell viability assay as well as the endpoint XTT growth assay, we found that AZ82 treatment resulted in a significant growth inhibition of human melanoma cells at 2-3.5 &#181;M concentrations. Additionally, AZ82 treatments resulted in a significant decrease in clonogenic survival in all three human melanoma cell lines. Collectively, our data suggests a potential role of KIFC1 in melanoma progression, and merits further investigation to determine the roles and functional and therapeutic significance of KIFC1 in melanoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinesin,Melanoma\/skin cancers,KIFC1,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Davis S.

Current treatment regimens include immunotherapies as well as targeted therapies (e.g. BRAF and MEK inhibitors). However, these immuno- or targeted therapies have been associated with acquired resistance and, therefore, failure of therapy. Therefore, development of novel mechanistically-targeted therapies is of paramount importance for an efficient management of this neoplasm. Sirtuins, a seven-member family of class III histone deacetylases, have been implicated in the development\/progression of multiple cancers, including melanoma. Previous studies from our laboratory and elsewhere have shown the pro-proliferative functions of sirtuins SIRT1 and SIRT3 in melanoma. We have also shown that the small molecule inhibitor 4&#8217;-bromoresveratrol (4&#8217;-BR; co-inhibitor of SIRT1 and SIRT3) has antiproliferative effects in melanoma cell lines as well as in a <i>B<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>af<\/i><i><sup>V600E<\/sup><\/i><i>\/<\/i><i>P<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>en<\/i><i><sup>NULL<\/sup><\/i> mouse model of melanoma. This study was designed to further expand on our previous findings and to determine the therapeutic significance of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in melanoma. To determine the effect of specific inhibition of SIRT3 on melanoma progression, we treated <i>Braf<\/i><i><sup>V600E<\/sup><\/i><i>\/<\/i><i>Pten<\/i><i><sup>NULL<\/sup><\/i> mice with 100 &#956;g small interfering RNA (siRNA) against SIRT3 (siSIRT3) or its non-targeting control (siNTC) twice weekly (intraperitoneal injections for 5 weeks). We found a trend of decreased tumor volumes in the siSIRT3-treated mice, though not significant. A similar trend was seen in the final tumor weight of these mice. In the next series of experiments, we used two human melanoma patient-derived xenografts (PDXes) to compare the effect of 4&#8217;-BR or siSIRT3 on melanoma tumor growth. Similar to our published study in the <i>Braf<\/i><i><sup>V600E<\/sup><\/i><i>\/<\/i><i>Pten<\/i><i><sup>NULL<\/sup><\/i> mice, we found that 4&#8217;-BR treatment (50 mg\/kg, via intraperitoneal injection, twice weekly for 5 weeks) resulted in a significant decrease in tumor growth when compared to vehicle control mice. Additionally, the final tumor weight was significantly decreased in the 4&#8217;-BR group. However, the siSIRT3 treatments resulted in a decrease but non-significant decrease in melanoma tumor growth or final weights, supporting our observations in <i>Braf<\/i><i><sup>V600E<\/sup><\/i><i>\/<\/i><i>Pten<\/i><i><sup>NULL<\/sup><\/i> mice. Considering the lung is a common site for metastasis in melanoma, metastatic nodules in the lungs were quantified in one of our PDX models. We observed a decreased number in both the siSIRT3 and 4&#8217;-BR groups vs their respective controls. Overall, our data suggests that targeting SIRT3 alone may not be sufficient for melanoma treatment, and that the concomitant inhibition of SIRT1 and SIRT3 (and potential other sirtuins with pro-proliferative functions in melanocytic cells) may be better for melanoma management. Indeed, additional research is needed to validate our findings in relevant models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sirtuins,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Karla Anaya Aldrete<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gabriella R.

Therefore, it is important to dissect molecular mechanisms implicated in PC pathophysiology. Dual specificity phosphatase-4 (DUSP4) is a phosphatase known to negatively regulate the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family (MAPK\/ERK, SAPK\/JNK, P38), which are involved in multiple cancers, including PC. Previously, using tissue microarray containing a variety of pancreatic cancers and normal pancreatic tissues, we found that DUSP4 was significantly downregulated in human PC. We also demonstrated that forced overexpression of DUSP4 resulted in anti-proliferative responses in MIA PaCa-2 human PC cells (<i>Cancer Res 2016; 76 (14_Supplement): 3667<\/i>). Here, we expanded our study to determine, i) the effects of DUSP4 overexpression on tumorigenicity <i>in vivo<\/i>, and ii) the molecular mechanisms associated with DUSP4 overexpression-mediated anti-proliferative responses. MIA PaCa-2 cells were stably transfected with DUSP4 overexpression (OE) plasmid or its empty vector (pCMV6) control, followed by subcutaneous implantation into nu\/nu mice (n=8 each group). Tumor growth was measured weekly for 6 weeks followed by excision of tumors and molecular analyses. We found significant reduction in tumor volume and weight in DUSP4 OE group. Further, we found marked reduction in p-ERK1\/2 and p-P38 proteins in tumors from DUSP4 OE group. To determine the global mechanisms of DUSP4, we analyzed DUSP4-overexpressing MIA PaCa-2 cell lysates using quantitative global proteomics. Overall, 1678 proteins were identified with &#8805;2 unique peptides. Out of these, 54 proteins were significantly modulated &#8805;1.6-fold. Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), we found the association of modulated proteins with increased apoptosis and inhibited invasive and malignant tumors. The top five modulated proteins identified in response to DUSP4 OE were ADD3, PDLIM1, COL2A1, SLC20A1 and CALB2, with the first three being upregulated and the remaining two downregulated. Based on published studies in other cancers, these data support the tumor suppressor role of DUSP4 in PC since i) the loss of ADD3 and PDLIM1 (both cytoskeleton-related proteins) have been found to promote tumor growth, ii) higher expression of COL2A1 has been associated with delayed tumor recurrence, iii) higher expression of SLC20A1 (sodium-phosphate symporter) and CALB2 (calcium-binding protein) are known to be associated with cancer progression. The specific roles of these proteins in PC are not well known, providing us novel opportunities for future investigations. Overall, our data support the tumor suppressor role of DUSP4 in PC and warrants further research to validate our findings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET01-04 Oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and gene products as targets for therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Proteomic analysis,Tumor suppressor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Chandra K.

On the other hand, biding to OX40 which normally expressed on Treg cells can induce ADCC effect and kill the Treg cells. There is a synergistic effect between the blocking of PDL1 pathway and the activation of OX40 signal pathway in cell base assay. PBMCs from four healthy donors showed significant T cell activation effect under the stimulation of superantigen SEB, and the activity of PBMCs from three healthy donors was significantly stronger than that of two single target control antibodies alone and in combination. The anti-tumor activity of KN052 was evaluated by using hPD-L1\/hOX40 humanized mouse with MC38 MCA205 syngeneic model. Significant anti-tumor effects were observed in both models in a dose-dependent manner. The HNSTD (highest non-severely toxic dose) of KN052 was determined as 30mg\/kg in cynomolgus monkeys.

Cachexia is particularly prevalent in pancreatic, lung, colorectal and gastro-intestinal cancers and can lead to reduced tolerance and responsiveness to chemotherapy, increased treatment-related toxicity and morbidity, and poor overall quality of life. There are currently no approved therapies for cancer cachexia.<br \/>The development and maintenance of muscle tissue is dependent on the balance between protein synthesis and protein degradation, controlled through various anabolic and catabolic signaling pathways. Dysregulation of these pathways can result in muscle atrophy, which arises in many chronic illnesses. The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) has a central role in regulating skeletal muscle physiology. Previous work utilizing USP19 knock out mouse models has demonstrated that USP19 plays an important role in muscle wasting and can protect against denervation-induced muscle atrophy <sup>#2<\/sup>.<br \/>We have previously demonstrated that inhibition of USP19 enzymatic activity spares the muscle wasting observed in limb-casted and denervated mouse models of muscle wasting. Here, we report the discovery of a novel, highly potent and selective inhibitor of USP19 (ADC-846) and demonstrate its utility in a cancer-induced muscle atrophy model <i>in vivo<\/i>. Pharmacological inhibition of USP19 by ADC-846 increased lean muscle and fat mass following oral dosing in a Lewis Lung Carcinoma-induced cachexia model and reduced the cachexic index by &#62;60% compared to controls.

Several studies in the last decade confirmed that the USP11 (Ubiquitin-Specific proteases 11) had promoted tumor growth and metastasis. Indeed, pan-cancer data analysis reveals enhanced expression of USP11 in numerous malignancies, including lymphoma. Our lab has established that USP11 deubiquitinates and stabilizes the translation initiation factor eIF4B (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 4B) to promote eIF4B-dependent oncogenic translation and to facilitate the proliferation of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Brody and colleagues screened 2000 FDA- approved compounds and reported that the anti-neoplastic agent mitoxantrone is an effective non-specific inhibitor of USP11, which was later observed to target USP15. Thus, catalytically targeting USP11 provides substantial challenges as it encompasses high homology with the functional orthologs USP4 and USP15. Addressing this major limitation, Spiliotopoulos et al. identified a unique USP11-specific allosteric site without impeding USP15 and USP4 activities. Utilizing this platform, we performed a virtual screening of more than 10 million compounds from publicly available databases and identified 307 potential unique hits. The chemical library of these hits was assessed using an in-house optimized in-cell high throughput screening assay. The primary screening revealed that 16 of the hit compounds with EC<sub>50<\/sub> less than 10&#956;M. The two most potent, structurally different, USP11 inhibitors, RBF4 and RBF11, were further evaluated. <i>In-vitro<\/i> deubiquitinase activity assay of USP11 showed minimal inhibition on treatment with compounds (as we are targeting an allosteric site), which indicates that RBF4 and 11 do not bind to the catalytic domain. Thermal shift assays revealed that RBF4 preferentially stabilizes USP11 compared to other functional paralogues USP4 and USP15, which validates the selective USP11-RBF4 interaction. Further, treatment with RBF4 and 11 hampered DLBCL proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Significantly, treatment with selected compounds depleted USP11-dependent oncogenic expression and, thus, the colony-forming capacity of DLBCL. These results show that these novel compounds can serve as an ideal tool to increase our understanding of USP11 biology and may emerge as an example of potent and selective USP11 inhibitors. Currently, we are evaluating their anti-cancer potency in pre-clinical models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ubiquitination,Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,Drug discovery,Oncogene,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Forum Kayastha<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bandish Kapadia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noah B.

Trastuzumab (TmAb) is a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds and inhibits human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein (HER2). It is widely used for the treatment of certain types of breast, stomach, and esophageal cancer, and is commercially available for both intravenous (IV) infusion (Herceptin&#174;, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA) [Herceptin IV] and SC injection (Herceptin Hylecta&#174;, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA) [Hylecta SC]. XeriJect TmAb is a stable formulation of a trastuzumab biosimilar at a higher concentration (432 mg\/mL) than Hylecta (120 mg\/mL) for SC administration, thus enabling lower injection volumes. This study evaluated and compared XeriJect TmAb SC (120 mg) to Herceptin IV (10 mg\/kg) and Hylecta SC (120 mg) in a minipig pharmacokinetic model.<br \/>Results: Among a total of 12 minipigs, Herceptin was administered IV at 10 mg\/kg over a 90-minute infusion and all other formulations were administered at a target dose of 120 mg SC. Due to the higher concentration of XeriJect TmAb, the injection volume of Xeriject TmAb (0.28 mL) was considerably lower than Hylecta (1 mL). XeriJect TmAb was rapidly absorbed similar to Hylecta after SC administration with a median T<sub>max<\/sub> of 1.0 days with both formulations and a mean C<sub>max<\/sub>\/Dose of 9.7 and 9.5 kg*&#181;g\/mL\/mg, respectively. In contrast, Herceptin IV produced a median T<sub>max<\/sub> of 0.06 days and C<sub>max<\/sub>\/Dose of 18.0 kg*&#181;g\/mL\/mg. All formulations (Herceptin IV, Hylecta SC, XeriJect TmAb SC) demonstrated similar elimination profiles and exposure as assessed by AUC<sub>last<\/sub>\/Dose. The mean [SD] AUC<sub>last<\/sub>\/Dose of XeriJect TmAb (108 [4.2] day*kg*&#181;g\/mL\/mg) was similar to Hylecta SC (109 [22.4] day*kg*&#181;g\/mL\/mg) and Herceptin IV (97 [7.5] day*kg*&#181;g\/mL\/mg). The mean [SD] elimination half-life of XeriJect&#174; TmAb SC (11.4 [10.1] days) was also similar to Hylecta&#174; SC (11.3 [4.8] days) and longer than with Herceptin&#174; IV (8.8 [2.1] days).<br \/>Conclusion: We have demonstrated for the first time that administration of XeriJect TmAb, a stable high-concentration formulation of trastuzumab administered SC, produced rapid absorption and similar pharmacokinetics to commercially available Herceptin IV and Hylecta SC in a preclinical pharmacokinetic model.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug delivery,Pharmacokinetics,Herceptin,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Rick Fitch<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diana Bowman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martin Donovan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Steven Prestrelski<\/i><\/presenter>.

An antibody drug conjugate (ADC) with a microtubule inhibitor (MTI) payload recently received accelerated approval from the FDA for FR&#945;-expressing platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. We describe for the first time the preclinical activity of AZD5335, an FR&#945;-targeting antibody conjugated to AZ&#8217;s proprietary topoisomerase 1 inhibitor (TOP1i) payload, AZ14170132, with a homogeneous drug-to-antibody ratio of 8 (DAR8) and potential benefits vs an MTI-based ADC. AZD5335&#8217;s primary mechanism of action is to deliver TOP1i payload into FR&#945;-expressing cancer cells, leading to DNA damage and apoptotic cell death. The TOP1i payload mediates bystander killing, which is important for targeting tumors with less than uniformly positive expression. Here, we report that a single dose of AZD5335 at 2.5 mg\/kg was sufficient to provide a robust and durable anti-tumor response in FR&#945;-expressing ovarian cancer cell line xenografts (CDX) with a tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 75%-94% and median best tumor volume reduction &#62;30% in 14\/17 (82%) ovarian cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDX) evaluated. FR&#945;-expression levels (by IHC and deep-learning based image analysis) correlated with efficacy in the tested PDX models, and we observed that AZD5335 was also active in models with low levels of target expression (75% of cells with FR&#945; staining of 2+), expected to be representative of patients who would be ineligible for treatment with the MTI-ADC. Furthermore, AZD5335 demonstrated superior activity vs an FR&#945;-MTI benchmark ADC with respect to anti-tumor activity and duration of response in two PDX models with low-to-medium FR&#945; expression at equal or higher drug doses (e.g., in OV0857-CIS: 96% TGI vs 24% TGI at 5 mg\/kg and 95% TGI vs 2% TGI at 2.5 mg\/kg of a single IV dose AZD5335 and FR&#945;-MTI, respectively). These data indicate that AZD5335 is a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of ovarian cancers across the spectrum of FR&#945;-expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Folate receptor,Ovarian cancer,Preclinical,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marco Gymnopoulos<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tima Thomas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Diana Gasper<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Judith Anderton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ravinder Tammali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ed Rosfjord<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nick Durham<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chris Ward<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Claire Myers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jixin Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wenyan Zhong<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Simon Christ<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lina Meinecke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katharina Nekolla<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Sebastian Monasor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roger Dodd<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Neki Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mark Albertella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jorge Zeron-Medina<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paula Fraenkel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Puja Sapra<\/i><\/presenter>.

This is in part because the nuanced requirements for successful CAR-T cell trafficking into brain tumors are not well understood. Intracranial administration has been shown to be both safe and effective in delivery of other anti- cancer drugs in GBM, with one example being Gliadel, involving the placement of carmustine chemotherapy-loaded wafers into the post-resection space for sustained release into local brain tissue. Recurrence of GBM is most often local, suggesting that regional therapies might both serve the immediate and long-term needs of the patients. Here we used extracellular matrix-based scaffolds to encapsulate and locally deliver CAR T cells to GBM for enhancement of CAR T cell infiltration and promotion of effector function against GBM. We decellularized and solubilized commercially procured fresh frozen porcine brain tissues to create temperature-responsive porcine brain matrix solutions that gelled at physiologic body temperatures. We confirmed extent of decellularization using DNA quantification of processed tissue and quantified major protein composition of solubilized product using mass spectrometry. Gelation kinetics and resulting hydrogel structures were quantified using turbidometry and rheology, with an average gelation time of 15<u>+<\/u> 8 min and comparable storage modulus range of 100-200 Pa to Matrigel or Collagen 1-based commercial hydrogel products. Both unmodified healthy donor T cells and donor T cells transduced with EGFRvIII-targeting CAR scFv were &#62;75% viable over 4d <i>in vitro<\/i>, and release of doses ranging from 2M-5M CAR T cells after encapsulation were observed over 4d <i>in vitro <\/i>using Transwell inserts. Released CAR T cells were found to be potently cytotoxic in tumor-killing assays using EGFRvIII+ U87MG target cells at 1:1 E:T within impedance cytotoxicity assays, performing comparably to freshly made non-encapsulated CAR T cells and better than CAR T cells released from Matrigel or Collagen scaffolds at the same timepoints. We have developed a mouse model of GBM resection and recurrence to evaluate the efficacy of hydrogel-delivered CAR T cell treatment after resection surgery to capitalize on a currently underutilized treatment window. This injectable scaffold will support an immediate clinical need by supporting delivery, expansion, and actuation of CAR T function within the solid tumor microenvironment without the challenges of peripheral delivery to a specialized organ system.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Meghan Logun<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zev Binder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Donald O'Rourke<\/i><\/presenter>.

Myeloid cells readily accumulate in tumors, in some cases contributing up to 75% of the tumor mass. While supporting tumor growth and being associated with unfavorable prognosis, myeloid cells can mediate phagocytosis of cancer cells and cytotoxic tumor killing and promote adaptive immune responses through antigen presentation and co-stimulation, therefore representing promising targets in cancer therapy. The ability to engineer circulating and tumor associated myeloid cells to activate their ability to elicit anti-tumor adaptive immunity is an attractive approach to harness systemic anti-tumor immunity. However, it remains challenging to specifically target and activate myeloid cells <i>in vivo<\/i>. To overcome this hurdle, we have developed a novel <i>in vivo<\/i> myeloid cell engineering platform in which a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is generated by fusing a tumor recognition scFv with the alpha chain of human Fc receptors (CD89). The stable expression and function of these receptors requires the endogenously expressed common Fc receptor gamma chain (FcR&#947;), which expression is mostly restricted to myeloid cells. For <i>in vivo<\/i> engineering, the construct is encapsulated and delivered in lipid nanoparticles (LNP). Trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2) is overexpressed in most human solid epithelial cancers, as compared to low expression in corresponding normal tissue. Increased TROP2 expression has been linked to increased tumor growth and has been implicated as a prognostic marker in these cancers, supporting the development of therapies targeting TROP2. Intravenous infusion of LNP encapsulating mRNA encoding the anti-TROP2-CD89 fusion protein results in the uptake of the LNPs and expression of the chimeric receptor fusion protein in myeloid cells. In immunodeficient xenograft models of hepatocellular carcinoma and triple negative breast cancer, delivery of LNP mRNA encoding GPC3-CD89 or TROP2-CD89 fusion proteins resulted in anti-tumor efficacy, confirming the ability of this approach to program myeloid cells. Repeat dosing studies showed significant anti-tumor efficacy following bi-weekly administration of TROP2-CD89. Furthermore, in the B16\/10 syngeneic melanoma model, treatment with the melanoma antigen gp75-CD89 fusion protein was also associated with the initiation of broad systemic immune responses, characterized by tumor infiltration by activated CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, reduced tumor-associated Tregs and activation of antigen presenting cells in spleen. When infused in cynomolgus monkeys, TROP2-CD89 LNP led to cell surface expression of anti-TROP2 CAR in myeloid cells. Together these studies highlight the potential of in vivo delivery of CD89 fusion proteins to program myeloid cells to recognize and kill cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Monocyte,Nanoparticle,Solid tumors,Chimeric antigen receptor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Thomas E.

Although TAMs and MDSCs can be converted from tumor-supporting to tumor-suppressing phenotypes by treatment with proinflammatory immune stimulants (e.g. TLR7 agonists) in vitro, such strategies have proven to be too toxic in vivo because of their systemic activation of immune cells. Therefore, for such immune stimulants to be used to reprogram the immune system in solid tumors, they must be targeted specifically to the immune cells in the TME.<br \/>One strategy for targeting TAMs\/MDSCs is to exploit a receptor that is expressed solely on these cell types. Because folate receptor beta (FR&#946;) is expressed exclusively on myeloid cells and since FR&#946; acquires its ability to bind folic acid (FA) only in inflamed tissues, we have previously exploited FA to target attached TLR7 agonists (TLR7a) to FR&#946;+ TAMs\/MDSCs in solid tumors. While significant repolarization of TAMs and MDSCs was observed in this previous study, premature systemic release of the attached TLR7a caused unwanted toxicity. However, since FR&#946; was later found to reside in the same endosome as TLR7, we hypothesized that constructing a more stable FA-TLR7a conjugate with a non-cleavable linker should not only prevent premature TLR7a release, but also deposit the FA-TLR7a into an endosome containing a TLR7 receptor, thereby enabling selective activation of TAMs and MDSCs in the TME. The data summarized here confirm this hypothesis. Thus, free TLR7-1A was found to stimulate massive production of IL-6, TNF-&#945; and IFN&#947; upon addition to human peripheral blood in vitro or injected into live mice, suggesting cells in both species respond aggressively to TLR7-1A. However, performance of the same studies with FA-targeted TLR7-1A stimulated barely or nondetectable levels of the inflammatory cytokines, confirming that FA-TLR7-1A is unable to enter and activate cells that lack a folate receptor (FR&#946;). More importantly, intravenous administration of FA-TLR7-1A into mice bearing an orthotopic 4T1 breast tumor totally blocked metastases and induced tumor regression without causing detectable toxicity. Flow cytometric analyses of the residual tumor tissue further demonstrated that FA-TLR7-1A increased M1\/M2 macrophage ratios and elevated infiltration of CD8+ T cells into the tumor masses. Taken together, these data demonstrate that a targeted TLR7 agonist can rejuvenate immune cells in a solid tumor without systemically activating the immune system.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-08 Targeting the tumor microenvironment in drug development,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunostimulation,TLR7,Cancer immunotherapy,Tumor associated macrophages,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>John Victor Napoleon<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Fenghua Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rami A.

The TME comprises several factors that limit the response rate to immunotherapy, including immunosuppressive cells such as regulatory T cells (Tregs), which directly or indirectly interact with effector cells and undermine the tumor recognition, activation, proliferation, and survival of the effector cells, thereby promoting tumor growth. To overcome suppressive TME, we designed AWT030, a first-in-class bi-functional IL-21 fusion protein that comprises a stability and potency optimized IL-21 mutein and an engineered functional domain that targets T cells. AWT030 is designed to selectively activate tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells and suppress Tregs while avoiding the potential suppressive effect of IL-21 on dendritic cells.Compared to wild-type IL-21, mAWT030 greatly enhances the tolerability, half-life, and anti-tumor activity. In anti-PD-1 therapy resistant breast cancer EMT6 model, fibrosarcoma MCA205 model, and anti-PD-1 therapy responsive colon cancer MC38 model, mAWT030 achieved 100% complete response without noticeable toxicity, demonstrating a powerful synergy between tumor specific CD8 T cell activation axis and Treg suppression axis induced simultaneously by mAWT030. In addition, mAWT030 also exhibited a strong synergistic effect with anti-PD-1 antibody. Immunophenotyping revealed that AWT030 had minimal impact on circulating lymphocytes while altering the suppressive TME, with a significantly increased CD8 T cell population and suppressed Treg population. In summary, AWT030 is a novel bi-functional IL-21 fusion protein with high tumoral specificity, the excellent safety and antitumor activity of mAWT030 observed preclinically supports clinical development, focusing on treating PD-1 resistant\/relapsed patients or combining with anti-PD-1 therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-08 Targeting the tumor microenvironment in drug development,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,Regulatory T cells,Cytokines,Cytotoxic T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Fan Ye<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianing Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandra Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ella Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jenny Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hanna Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Hua<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Danny Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zoey Huang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joyce Kwan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lili Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ziyang Zhong<\/i><\/presenter>.

Compared with other Trop-2-targeted ADCs in the field, such as Trodelvy, TINA-SHR7971<sup>1<\/sup> (a molecule synthesized using the published structure of DS-1062), and SKB264, SHR-A1921 has considerable advantages as follows: (1) Stronger binding affinity to both human and rhesus macaque TROP-2 than TINA-SHR7971<sup>1<\/sup>; (2) Improved plasma stability in plasma of different species presumably due to the proper steric hindrance which was purposely designed on the payload for reducing non-intended cleavage; (3) Stronger bystander cell killing effect presumably due to the increased lipophilicity of the payload vs. that of the payload in TINA-SHR7971<sup>1<\/sup>; (4) Superior <i>in vivo e<\/i>fficacy in a PSCC<sup>2<\/sup> CDX Model (FaDu) with high Trop-2 expression (TGI 101% vs 53% [TINA-SHR7971<sup>1<\/sup>] @ 1 mpk) and in an ovarian cancer CDX Model (SK-OV-3) with moderate Trop-2 expression (TGI 63% vs. 23% [TINA-SHR7971<sup>1<\/sup>] @ 3 mpk; 87% vs. 16% [TINA-SHR7971<sup>1<\/sup>] @ 10 mpk); (5) &#8805; 2X longer half-life in patients# vs. SKB264 vs. IMMU-132, supporting more flexible dosing frequency; (6) Lower free toxin\/ADC ratio# regarding PK exposure in patients compared with SKB264<sup> <\/sup>(&#60; 1% vs. 5-6%); (7) approximately linear pharmacokinetics profile in patients with T<sub>1\/2<\/sub> ranging from 2.5 to 4.5 days. In summary, SHR-A1921 is a novel anti-TROP2-targeted ADC with a high permeable payload and optimized DAR demonstrating great stability and high potency in both <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i> studies. SHR-A1921 also showed compelling efficacy and good safety profile from 50+ subjects of Phase I clinical trial in China (NCT05154604). Pivotal phase III trial for NSCLC is planned in China. (Notes: 1.

Here we presented a potential best-in-class HER2-directed ADC, SHR-A1811, which was composed of trastuzumab, a stable and cleavable linker, and a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor payload (SHR9265). SHR9265 was a delicately selected exatecan derivative with a better liposolubility and cellular permeability: SHR9265 had a higher AlogP value than SHR7971, synthesized using published DXd structure (3.67 <i>vs<\/i>. 2.72). Consistently, SHR9265 showed ~5 times higher membrane permeability (PAMPA model) at pH5 and pH7.4. Cell killing activity of SHR9265 was ~3 times more potent than SHR7971. SHR-A1811 had a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 5.7, and showed HER2-dependent growth inhibition against various breast cancer and gastric cancer cell lines. In the bystander killing system, SHR-A1811 was able to kill both SK-BR-3 (HER2+) and MDA-MB-468 (HER2-) cells when co-cultured, with the IC<sub>50<\/sub> on MDA-MB-468 of 0.28 nM. The <i>in vitro<\/i> efficacy of SHR-A1811 was comparable with anti-Her2-SHR9265 (DAR 7.5) and ADC1 (synthesized using T-DXd structure), and stronger than anti-Her2-SHR9265 (DAR 3.5). In SK-BR-3 (HER2 high), JIMT-1 (HER2 moderate) and capan-1 (HER2 low) xenograft models, SHR-A1811 treatment resulted in a dramatic and sustained inhibition of tumor growth. A significantly stronger antitumor activity was observed for SHR-A1811 than ADC1 under the same dosages. Moreover, SHR-A1811 showed good stability and improved safety profiles, presumably due to the proper steric hindrance which was purposely designed on the payload (SHR9265). Less than 2% of payload release was observed in human plasma after a 21-day incubation. The HNSTD of SHR-A1811 in cynomolgus monkeys was 40mpk with thymus as the main target organ. No death and lung lesions were observed at dose levels up to 70mpk for 42 days, while ADC1 led to one male cynomolgus monkey death on day 10 at 70mpk with multiple lung damages. These findings were consistent with safety profiles observed in a multi-center, dose-escalation phase I clinical trial (NCT0444620). Patients with different solid tumor types received initial intravenous doses of SHR-A1811 from 1 to 8.0 mg\/kg. Only trace amount of free toxin was detected. The Cmax of payload was 3.85 ng\/ml at 8mg\/kg of SHR-A1811. The incidence of G2 ILD was &#60; 2.5% and the treatment discontinuation rate was 5.1% across doses. In summary, with a highly permeable payload, optimized DAR, great potency and better clinical safety profiles, SHR-A1811 has demonstrated the best-in-class potential. Currently SHR-A1811 has entered phase II and phase III clinical studies for breast cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, and NSCLC (NCT05424835, NCT05482568, NCT04818333, NCT05349409).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-09 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),HER2,superior bystander effect,optimal DAR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Ting Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lingfeng You<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianyan Xu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junzhao Yin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bolei Qu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuchang Mao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Beibei Fu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dan Cao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Linda Zhao<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Feng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Min Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Feng He<\/i><\/presenter>.

The mechanisms underlying the progression of prostate cancer to NEPC are largely unclear, and new drug targets are desperately needed.&nbsp;NEPC is known to be highly vascularized. Elevated expression of NE markers and increased angiogenesis are two prominent phenotypes of NEPC, and thus are expected to be linked. However, direct molecular links between these two phenotypes are still elusive, whose elucidation will substantially expand our knowledge in NEPC and enable the development of effective treatments for NEPC. Through RNAi &#38; cDNA screening and functional validations, we previously discovered that GPCR-kinase 3 (GRK3) is essential preferentially for highly metastatic cancer cells as compared to lowly metastatic cancer cells. The mechanisms of GRK3 in prostate cancer progression were mostly unknown.<br \/>Our new data indicate that GRK3 is significantly overexpressed in metastatic prostate tumors from patients, especially in NEPC. GRK3 promotes both angiogenesis and neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer cells, indicating that it is a key missing link for these two phenotypes. Mechanistically, GRK3 enhances the epigenetic repressor activity of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) to suppress key repressors of angiogenesis or NE phenotype. Through compound library screening, we have identified several compounds that block kinase activity of GRK3 much more potently than that of GRK2, the closest-related kinase to GRK3. Of note, our GRK3 inhibitors could substantially reduce angiogenesis and NE marker expression, as well as significantly inhibit NEPC cell growth in culture and in mouse xenografts.<br \/>In summary, kinase GRK3 connects angiogenesis and neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer progression. Its mechanism of actions is at least in part through enhancing HDAC2&#8217;s epigenetic activity. Results based on our novel GRK3 inhibitors suggest that GRK3 is a valuable new drug target for aggressive prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-03 Identification of molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroendocrine differentiation,Angiogenesis,Kinases,Histone deacetylase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Samira Naderinezhad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guoliang Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zheng Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dayong Zheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Junwei Lian<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Wenliang Li<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
