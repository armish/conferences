[{"Abstract":"Previous studies have shown that cancer cell lines with homozygous deletion of the MTAP<\/i> gene (MTAP<\/i> del), are selectively sensitive to shRNA-mediated PRMT5 inhibition or MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors. PRMT5 is a methyltransferase that adds symmetric dimethyl arginine marks to various proteins essential for cell viability whereas MTAP is responsible for metabolizing MTA as part of the methionine salvage pathway. In MTAP<\/i> del cells, MTA accumulates and partially inhibits PRMT5 activity by directly competing with SAM, the universal methyl donor and PRMT5 substrate. Thus, the deletion of MTAP<\/i> leads to the formation of the PRMT5-MTA complex and functions as a synthetic lethal target. In this capacity, MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors are hypothesized to exhibit an increased therapeutic index compared to first generation PRMT5 inhibitors by preferentially inhibiting PRMT5 in MTAP<\/i> del cancer cells while sparing normal cells. First generation PRMT5 inhibitors target either apo-PRMT5 or the PMRT5-SAM complex, while MRTX1719 preferentially binds the PRMT5-MTA complex, stabilizing the complex in an inactive state. Thermal shift analysis demonstrated rapid and complete binding of MRTX1719 to MTA-bound PRMT5 whereas binding to SAM-bound PRMT5 was delayed and incomplete after prolonged incubation. First generation clinical-stage PRMT5 inhibitors showed either preferential binding to the PRMT5-SAM complex or no selectivity between the PRMT5-MTA complex, the PMRT5-SAM complex, or apo-PRMT5 in the thermal shift assay, suggesting first generation inhibitors do not recapitulate the synthetic lethal phenotype in MTAP del cancers. In vitro, MRTX1719 exhibits a durable pharmacodynamic effect in MTAP<\/i> del cells or MTAP<\/i> WT cells incubated with MTA following drug washout in agreement with the long target residence time suggested by the thermal shift data. Moreover, in vivo time course studies confirm MRTX1719 exhibits potent and durable inhibition of PRMT5-dependent symmetric dimethyl arginine (SDMA) in MTAP<\/i> del tumor xenografts. HemaTox&#8482; viability assays were used to determine potency against human MTAP<\/i> WT erythroid and myeloid cells where MRTX1719 was ~45-fold less potent compared to the MTAP<\/i> del HCT116 cancer cell line. In contrast, first generation PRMT5 inhibitors were similarly potent against the HCT116 isogenic cell lines and human hematopoietic cells, irrespective of MTAP<\/i> status. These data demonstrate MRTX1719 preferentially and potently binds PRMT5 in the presence of MTA and selectively inhibits MTAP<\/i> del cancer cell lines. Moreover, the kinetic properties and selectivity profile suggest MRTX1719 will exhibit a significantly improved therapeutic window for the treatment of MTAP<\/i> del cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-03 Pharmacogenetics and therapeutic response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Laura Vegar<sup><\/sup>, Ruth Aranda<sup><\/sup>, Laura Waters<sup><\/sup>, Krystal Moya<sup><\/sup>, Allan Hebbert<sup><\/sup>, Christopher S.

Despite the efficacy of cBTKi, treatment failure often occurs through development of resistance or intolerance. Pirtobrutinib, a highly selective, non-covalent BTKi, potently inhibits both WT and C481 mutant BTK. Pirtobrutinib has favorable oral pharmacology, is well tolerated, and has shown promising efficacy in patients with poor prognosis B cell malignancies following prior therapy, including prior cBTKi. Here we report in vitro BTK binding, conformation, and activation differences between cBTKi and pirtobrutinib. Cellular studies showed pirtobrutinib inhibited BTK phosphorylation at both Y223 and Y551 in REC-1 and Ramos A1 human lymphoma cell lines. In contrast, despite inhibition of Y223 phosphorylation, both cell lines treated with cBTKi, ibrutinib, acalabrutinib or zanubrutinib, retained Y551 phosphorylation. The differential effects on Y551 were also observed in PBMC isolated from treatment na&#239;ve human CLL donors treated in vitro with pirtobrutinib or ibrutinib. To investigate the binding effects of cBTKi and pirtobrutinib on BTK stability and conformation, a series of biophysical and structural studies were performed. In a hydrogen\/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry study using full length BTK, all compounds significantly inhibited exchange in regions surrounding the ATP binding site in the kinase domain. While cBTKi induced significantly increased exchange for peptides in the SH3 and SH2 domains, pirtobrutinib significantly reduced exchange in a portion of the SH3 domain, nearly the entire SH2 domain, and SH2 linker, suggesting that pirtobrutinib uniquely stabilizes BTK in a closed\/inactive conformation. Consistent with this proposed model, crosslinking mass spectrometry results of inhibitor bound BTK showed that pirtobrutinib promoted different interactions between the SH2 domain and kinase domain than cBTKi. To confirm that pirtobrutinib promotes greater stabilization of BTK, a mass spectrometry based cellular thermal shift assay was performed in both Ramos and BTK overexpressing HEK293 cells. In both cell lines, pirtobrutinib showed significantly greater stabilization of BTK compared to cBTKi. In addition, crystallographic studies of BTK in complex with pirtobrutinib revealed domain organization consistent with stabilized SH2-SH3 interactions with the kinase domain. These data suggest pirtobrutinib may differentially impact BTK stability and conformation compared to cBTKi. The cellular and biophysical data are consistent with a model in which cBTKi shift BTK toward an open conformation, whereas pirtobrutinib allosterically stabilizes a closed BTK conformation, preventing activation by upstream kinases. Additional studies are underway to further characterize the differential effects of pirtobrutinib on BTK conformation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-02 Molecular pharmacology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BTK,Pirtobrutinib,Mantle cell lymphoma,Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Joshua  A.

However, it provides no benefit after combined AG with PD-1 antibody, which needs to be optimized urgently. Surufatinib (SUR) is a novel small-molecule inhibitor that observably inhibits VEGFR 1, 2, 3, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR 1), and colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), which simultaneously shows anti-angiogenic activity and immune microenvironment activation. Herein, we aimed to explore the synergistic effect and related mechanism of SUR plus AG and PD-1 antibody (SAP) regimen.<br \/>Methods: Surgical tumor specimens were collected and analyzed using single-cell sequencing and immunohistochemistry technology. Orthotopic transplantation mice model of pancreatic cancer and co-culture system of pancreatic cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were successively established to reveal the potential molecular mechanism of SUR in optimizing the effects of AG plus PD-1 antibody, by western blot, immunofluorescence and ubiquitination experiments.<br \/>Results: Tumor CSF-1 levels were markedly promoted in pancreatic cancer patients after the treatment of gemcitabine, while an increased infiltration of M2 polarized TAMs (M2-TAMs) was induced. A time-dependent upregulation of M2-TAMs infiltration and PD-L1 expression were also observed after the treatment of AG regimen, which might interfere the therapeutic benefits of AG plus PD-1. In co-culture system, tumor PD-L1 expression levels were distinctly down-regulated after the treatment of SAP regimen, while the decreased infiltration of M2-TAMs was observed. In pancreatic cancer cell, PD-L1 protein synthesis were obviously inhibited by SUR, instead of PD-L1 mRNA expression. After the pancreatic cancer cells pretreated with cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis, the half-life period of PD-L1 was ulteriorly reduced by SUR. Inversely, the inhibitory action of SUR on PD-L1 expression was reversed by proteasome inhibitor PS-341, rather than lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine. As a result, it indicated that the protein stability of PD-L1 might interfered by SUR via ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Particularly, when compared with AG plus PD-1 antibody treatment in tumor-bearing model, SAP regimen significantly down-regulated the expression levels of CSF1R, CD163 and PD-L1, and inhibited tumor growth by promoting tumor cell apoptosis and improving the tumor immune microenvironment.<br \/>Conclusions: Forceful evidence supported that PD-L1 expression could be interfered by surufatinib via ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and M2-TAMs regulation. Herein, additional administration of surufatinib might improve the immunosuppression and drug resistance caused by AG, and increase the curative effect of AG plus PD-1 antibody treatment in clinical practice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-02 Molecular pharmacology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,Surufatinib,Tumor associated macrophages,Tumor immune microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Song Gao<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Wenbo Zhu<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaofan Guo<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuexiang Liang<sup>1<\/sup>, Hongwei Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Peijun Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuning Song<sup>1<\/sup>, Jihui Hao<sup>1<\/sup>, Shaoshi Wen<sup>2<\/sup>, Xing Lv<sup>2<\/sup>, Jiancai Zhou<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Tianjin Medical Univ.

The azetidine-based compound, H182 irreversibly binds to Stat3. In cell-free DNA-binding assay, H182 selectively inhibited Stat3 DNA-binding activity (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 0.38-0.66 &#956;M) over Stat1 or Stat5 (IC<sub>50<\/sub>&#62;15.8 &#956;M) <i>in vitro<\/i>. In treated pancreatic cancer cells, H182 specifically blocked the association of Stat3 with gp130 and JAK2, and inhibited Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA-binding activity. Coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization studies of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Stat3 and EGFP-tagged Stat3 expressed in prostate cancer cells showed that treatment with H182 blocked the HA-Stat3:EGFP-Stat3 interactions in intact cells. Immunofluorescence staining with laser-scanning confocal microscopy analysis for the intracellular localization of Stat3 showed treatment of H182 disrupted Stat3 nuclear accumulation and promoted the aggregation of Stat3 at the perinuclear region. H182 consequently suppressed Stat3-dependent transcriptional activity and the expression of Stat3 downstream genes, including Cyclin A, Bcl-2, Cyclin B1, and Mcl-1.

Despite the significant advancements in immune therapy and targeted therapy, the overall prognosis for metastatic melanoma remains unsatisfactory. TP53 is a tumor suppressor, but its wildtype is inactivated in about 90% of melanoma. Since activated p53 can promote cancer cell apoptosis and thus effectively inhibit tumor growth and tumor metastasis, reactivation of p53 is considered a promising strategy for cancer therapy. Herein, we report a recently developed small molecule compound, JW-1-283, targeting the interactions between MDM2 E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase and p53 protein. <i>In vitro<\/i>, JW-1-283 showed potent cytotoxicity against A375 melanoma cell line (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 2.2&#177;0.3 &#956;M) which has wildtype p53, but its potency is substantially reduced in two other melanoma cell lines with either p53 mutation (M14) or p53 null (RPMI-7951) status. Treatment with JW-1-283 significantly dose-dependently reduced the stemness in A375 melanoma cells, as indicated by low numbers of colony formation, impaired tumor sphere formation abilities, and inhibition of cancer cell migration. Mechanistically, JW-1-283 disrupts the p53-MDM2 interaction, prevents p53 and MDM2 degradation in the existence of cycloheximide, and induces p38 and p53 phosphorylation in the apoptotic pathway. Genetic knockdown of p38 by siRNA further confirmed that the stabilized p53 could be subsequently phosphorylated by p38, leading to induced apoptosis as well as S phase cell cycle arrest. <i>In vivo<\/i>, when A375 tumors grown in NSG mice were treated with 7.5 mg\/kg of JW-1-283 intraperitoneally every other day for a consecutive of 16 days, significant inhibition of tumor growth was observed, along with decreased tumor cell proliferation, tumor angiogenesis, and enhanced tumor cell apoptosis. In summary, this work provides the initial proof-of-concept of developing the JW-1-283 scaffold as a potential strategy for advanced melanoma, which inhibits tumor growth by activating the p53 signaling pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-02 Molecular pharmacology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,TP53,Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yang Xie<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kelli Hartman<sup><\/sup>, Zhongzhi Wu<sup><\/sup>, Wei Li<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4fa6cd1e-b483-4e48-bbb7-1b050dd52483","ControlNumber":"2602","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Obesity\/overweight increases the risk of breast cancer due to estrogen generated from fat cells that fuel the growth of the ER-positive breast cancer. Previous studies from our lab have demonstrated that blockade of the amino acid transporter SLC6A14 by the small molecule &#945;-methyltryptophan reduces the growth of ER-positive breast cancer in mouse xenografts of human breast cancer cells and in a spontaneous mouse model of ER-positive breast cancer. We have also discovered that &#945;-methyltryptophan functions as a potent weight-loss agent. We believe that this compound would be effective for the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer, especially in obese\/overweight women. &#945;-methyltryptophan is metabolized by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase. Therefore, combination of this compound with carbidopa, a well-known inhibitor of this enzyme, might potentiate the anticancer efficacy of &#945;-methyltryptophan. We tested this idea in the present study using a syngeneic mouse model of ER-positive breast cancer using the mouse breast cancer cell line AT3.<br \/>Results: A syngeneic tumor-cell transplant mouse model was used for ER-positive breast cancer. AT3 cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of C57BL\/6 mice. This allows to monitor the growth of AT3 tumor growth in an immunologically competent mammary tissue environment. Drug treatment in drinking water was started after tumor growth was noticeable (100 mm<sup>3<\/sup>). There were four groups: (i) control; (ii) &#945;-methyltryptophan at 0.5 mg\/ml; (iii) carbidopa at 0.25 mg\/ml; (iv) &#945;-methyltryptophan at 0.5 mg\/ml + carbidopa at 0.25 mg\/ml. Tumor growth was monitored every three days. The mice were killed after 4 weeks of treatment. Tumors were excised and weighed. These studies showed that &#945;-methyltryptophan and carbidopa were independently effective in reducing the tumor (48% reduction, p&#60;0.05 for &#945;-methyltryptophan; 50% reduction, p&#60;0.05 for carbidopa), but the combination was the most effective (92% reduction, p&#60;0.01). These effects were evident irrespective of whether the monitored parameter was tumor weight or tumor volume.<br \/>Conclusion: The combination treatment significantly decreased the tumor size and volume compared to carbidopa and &#945;-methyltryptophan alone. We do not know yet if the improved efficacy of the combination of the two drugs is due to a simple additive effect or due to a synergistic effect. Studies have shown that carbidopa promotes degradation of ER, indicating that carbidopa has its own independent anticancer effect that is relevant to ER-positive breast cancer. Further studies are needed to differentiate between the effect of carbidopa as an independent anticancer agent and its ability to potentiate the anticancer efficacy of &#945;-methyltryptophan by preventing its metabolic degradation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-02 Molecular pharmacology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Antitumor effect,Estrogen receptor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sirin Falconi<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sabarish Ramachandran<sup><\/sup>, Vadivel Ganapathy<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3d13ff3a-c4b3-4d67-a339-39f78b2ae7ec","ControlNumber":"1539","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Overexpression and activation of the MDM2 and NFAT1 oncogenes frequently occur in human cancer and is associated with invasive and high grade\/late-stage tumors, metastasis, and recurrence, and are negative prognostic factors for cancer patients. Dual targeting MDM2 and NFAT1 represents a novel molecular target for the treatment of cancer. However, most of the current MDM2 inhibitors have been designed to block the binding between MDM2 and p53, and have limited efficacy against tumors with mutant or deficient p53. Considering that high incidence of <i>TP53<\/i> mutations and MDM2 overexpression in tumors, these MDM2 SMIs are expected to have low or no efficacy against those types of cancer. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify a novel, p53-independent strategy to inhibit MDM2, in order to affirm the therapeutic value of targeting MDM2. In addition, as an important inflammatory factor, there are no specific NFAT1 inhibitors developed for cancer therapy. By employing crystallization screening, NMR-based screening, and high-throughput virtual and cell-based screening assays, we discovered a class of makaluvamine analogs with the desired property. One of these analogs, MA242, was identified as a potent and selective MDM2 and NFAT1 inhibitor. Its in vitro and in vivo anti-breast cancer activities and underlying mechanisms of action were evaluated in breast cancer cell lines with various p53 backgrounds. Our results demonstrated that MA242 directly bound to MDM2 and NFAT1 protein with high affinity and induced its protein degradation. As a result of this binding, MA242 decreased cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis and G2\/M phase arrest in breast cancer cell lines, regardless of the p53 status. Furthermore, MA242 inhibited the tumor growth and metastasis in orthotopic and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, without any host toxicity. Single-cell sequencing results provided the molecular and cellular crosstalk between cancer and immune system, and identified the predictive biomarkers of response after the treatment. In conclusion, MA242 is a potent and selective MDM2 and NFAT1 dual inhibitor with distinct mechanisms of action compared to the existing inhibitors. Our data suggest that the dual targeting oncogene and inflammation is a promising strategy for the treatment of human cancer.

Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is one of the crucial regulators of redox condition and can affected to drug resistance through redox imbalance. The incidence and mortality of pancreatic cancer (PC) have been gradually increasing globally. Although the first line treatment with anticancer agents improves the disease status, acquired drug resistance is major huddles in the treatment failure. Targeting Nrf2 has been suggested as a promising therapeutic approach for the overcoming drug resistance. In the present study, Nrf2 was found to be upregulated in tumor tissues and gemcitabine-resistant PC cells. In addition, Nrf2 knockdown exhibited to recover gemcitabine sensitivity in the gemcitabine-resistant PC cells. To further validate the role of Nrf2 in gemcitabine-resistant cells, the effects of Nrf2 inhibitor, periplocin, were employed. Periplocin exerted the antiproliferative activities by regulating Nrf2 suppression which leads to the increase of reactive oxygen species generation. Furthermore, the downregulation of Nrf2 by periplocin was correlated to Keap1-mediated protein degradation. Docking simulation also confirmed the binding interaction of Nrf2 and Keap1 by periplocin. These findings suggest that targeting the Nrf2 might be a therapeutic strategy for overcoming acquired gemcitabine PC.

A major hindrance to the progress of new therapies is the selectivity of the blood brain barrier (BBB) which limits drug access to the tumor. Further, there are currently no minimally-invasive tests that can quickly and accurately determine whether novel therapeutics have crossed the BBB during clinical trials. Therefore, development of a non-invasive test that can identify drug delivery and target engagement in GBM represents an opportunity to enhance knowledge during early phase trials of a new compound&#8217;s pharmacological suitability and potential efficacy. This study proposes that cargo contained in GBM-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are small membrane-bound particles released from cells, may serve as one such pharmacodynamic reporter. We analyzed RNA-seq data for EVs isolated from two GBM patient-derived xenograft models grown as short-term <i>in vitro <\/i>cultures, GBM10 and GBM120, following treatment with either temozolomide (TMZ) or pevonedistat (MLN). We assessed whether EV RNA payloads vary with different drug concentrations (EC50 vs EC80) and at different time points (4hr vs 24hr) post treatment. In the samples treated with MLN, a few long non-coding RNAs are commonly upregulated across the different time points and two models. Under different TMZ concentrations, differentially expressed genes are overrepresented in biological processes such as cytoplasmic translation and cellular macromolecule biosynthesis. We also found a negative correlation between the TMZ concentration and Y RNA expression level, which are functionally involved with DNA replication. Additionally, using CIRI2, we predicted the amount of circular RNAs in the EV cargo; we found that the ratio of circular RNAs to their linear counterparts (CLR) varies under different treatments. In GBM10, the percentage of circRNA with CLR &#62; 1 decreases with increasing drug effect. Thus, our preliminary results indicate that EV cargo post-treatment may be a novel pharmacodynamic reporter in GBM. To apply such an assessment to patients, we have simultaneously pursued the development of an immunoprecipitation (IP) approach to enrich GBM-derived EVs that can then undergo cargo profiling. Potential biomarkers were screened across isolated GBM EVs from in vitro supernatant by western blot and ExoView analysis. B7H3 has emerged as a lead candidate for GBM-EV enrichment. To validate the ability of EV cargo to reflect drug distribution across the BBB in patients, current efforts are focused on applying IP enrichment of GBM-EVs in longitudinally-acquired cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients during their disease course. Overall, we anticipate that the results of this study will lead to development of a clinical test that reflects BBB penetration and tumor response, which will likely aid in novel drug development efforts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-01 Cellular pharmacology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular vesicles,Glioblastoma,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Valerie DeLuca<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nanyun Tang<sup>1<\/sup>, Yue Hao<sup>1<\/sup>, Anjali Raju<sup>1<\/sup>, Charles Shaffer<sup>1<\/sup>, Cecile Riviere-Cazaux<sup>2<\/sup>, Terry C.

In some cases, the relationships between genotype and drug responses are obvious, such as the response of tumors with defined oncogenic mutations to inhibitors of those mutant proteins. However, covalent KRAS G12C inhibitors (G12Ci) induce clinical responses in less than half of patients with oncogenic KRAS G12C-driven lung cancer, illustrating that genomic alterations not obviously related to the drug mechanism can have a dramatic impact.<br \/>We have developed and optimized an <i>in vivo<\/i> platform to identify pharmacogenomic interactions that dictate lung cancer responses to therapies. By coupling somatic genome editing, tumor barcoding, ultra-deep barcode sequencing, and robust statistical methods in genetically engineered mouse models of human lung cancer, we can quantify and compare candidate therapies across thousands of clonal tumors of diverse tumor suppressor genotypes. This platform provides a uniquely high-throughput and quantitative assessment of tumors that are initiated de novo within the natural immunocompetent tissue environment.<br \/>To uncover genotypes that are particularly important in controlling the response of tumors to oncogenic KRAS inhibition, we applied this platform to quantify the impact of 59 tumor suppressor genes on KRASG12C-driven lung tumor responses to G12Ci. Treatment resulted in approximately three-quarters reduction in both average tumor sizes and overall tumor burden, with a clear drug and dose dependence. Approximately one-quarter of inactivated genes significantly and consistently altered tumor responses across numerous G12Ci and replicate studies. Interestingly, most of these genes are thought to be in pathways not directly related to RAS signaling, and they exhibit a striking pattern in which treatment sensitivity is positively correlated with strength of the tumor suppressor effect.<br \/>This pharmacogenomic profile for G12Ci was categorically different than the profiles we have observed for chemotherapy and other therapies. Overall, these results provide direct causal evidence that certain tumor suppressor genotypes dramatically shift the effectiveness of G12Ci <i>in vivo<\/i> and generate hypotheses about patients likely to benefit from G12Ci relative to alternatives. Analysis of available human data provides early clinical support for some of these hypotheses. Ongoing efforts to define pharmacogenomic profiles of combination therapies could be of even greater importance. Platforms that can accurately predict how tumor genotype drives responses have the potential to transform precision cancer therapy, enabling more effective patient stratification and therapy combinations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-04 Pharmacogenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacogenomics,KRAS,Tumor suppressor,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Paul J.

For instance, ZG19018 rapidly and selectively forms covalent bonds with G12C-GDP, which accounts for lock-in KRAS protein as the inactive GDP-bound state but inhibits the activation of numerous downstream signaling pathways like RAF\/MEK on ERK phosphorylation. ZG19018 showed highly inhibition of a 3D growth panel for human cancer cell lines harboring the KRAS G12C mutation, e.g. H358 (NSCLCs), MIA PaCa-2 (pancreatic) and SW837 (colorectal), etc. For pharmacodynamics, a battery of <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> ADME\/DMPK studies indicated a high plasma protein binding (&#62;99.6%) of ZG19018 with over 40% bioavailability in rat and dog via oral administration for the adequate drug levels in various tissues including lung, crossing BBB to reach brain, and accumulation in tumors. For <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor efficacy, ZG19018 exhibited significant dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth of G12C-driven subcutaneous models in nude mouse like H358 NSCLC cells but induced further tumor regression in pancreatic cancer MIA PaCa-2 xenograft. ZG19018 also showed an enhanced anti-tumor activities as combined with chemo-reagent Donafinib, a broad tyrosine kinase inhibitor blocking RAF\/MEK\/ERK signaling pathways of tumor cells, in the same H358 xenograft model. The general toxicology studies in rat under 28 days repeated oral administration (<i>q.d.<\/i>) showed NOAEL and STD10 values at 75 and 150 mg\/kg\/day, respectively. The safety pharmacological studies showed no notable effects of ZG19018 on the cardiovascular, respiratory and CNS systems. The genotoxic potential studies indicated ZG19018 without mutagenesis.

ORIC-944 is a potent, highly selective allosteric small molecule inhibitor of PRC2&#8217;s embryonic ectoderm development (EED) subunit that is undergoing clinical development as an orally bioavailable monotherapy in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. We previously reported strong tumor growth inhibition with ORIC-944 in enzalutamide-resistant 22Rv1 prostate cancer xenografts. Here, to devise and implement a biomarker strategy aimed at ORIC-944 dose selection in the ongoing phase 1 study (NCT05413421), we undertook preclinical pharmacology studies and assay development.<br \/>Methods: Na&#239;ve and 22Rv1-tumor bearing male mice were treated with vehicle, 10, 30 or 100 mg\/kg ORIC-944 PO for up to 37 days. H3K27me3 was evaluated in dorsal skin (epidermal layer) and peripheral monocytes by IHC and an alphaLISA test, respectively. Since dying tumor cells release nucleosomes to circulation, cell-free (cf)-nucleosomal H3K27me3 levels normalized to cf-H3.1 were also assessed in plasma using a proprietary magnetic bead-based sandwich immunoassay. Tumors were profiled by RNA-sequencing and H3K27me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing. Results: In the epidermal skin layer, H3K27me3 was present in vehicle-treated na&#239;ve animals but strongly depleted in ORIC-944-treated mice in a dose-dependent manner. Likewise in monocytes, H3K27me3 was reduced to undetectable levels in 100 mg\/kg ORIC-944-treated mice. In plasma, normalized cf-nucleosomal H3K27me3 levels significantly decreased in response to ORIC-944 in a dose- and time-dependent manner, selectively in 22Rv1-tumor bearing mice compared to non-tumor bearing mice. Putative PRC2 target genes were identified in 22Rv1 xenografts by focusing on those genes with H3K27me3 binding in the promoter, whose expression was de-repressed by ORIC-944 in a time-dependent manner and then re-expressed after dose suspension. In the ongoing phase 1 study, H3K27me3 levels are being evaluated in the stratum spinosum of skin and in blood-derived monocytes using a proprietary IHC assay and alphaLISA test, respectively. Modulation in the expression of the putative PRC2 target genes is being assessed in blood-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells by RNA-sequencing.<br \/>Conclusion: This comprehensive biomarker strategy enables us to establish target engagement and capture exposure-dependent pharmacodynamics in the ongoing phase 1 study evaluating ORIC-944 as a best-in-class PRC2 inhibitor for the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Epigenetics,Histone methylation,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anneleen Daemen<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Natalie Yuen<sup><\/sup>, Aleksandr Pankov<sup><\/sup>, Eric  A.

One of its catalytic subunits, SMARCA4, is frequently mutated in multiple tumor types, and SMARCA4-deficient cells are highly dependent on the other catalytic subunit, SMARCA2, for survival. Therefore, targeting SMARCA2 with selective protein degraders has therapeutic potential in SMARCA4 deficient human cancers. We have previously described the development of a potent and selective SMARCA2 targeted degrader, PRT3789, that demonstrates robust degradation of SMARCA2 protein and excellent preclinical efficacy in SMARCA4-del models (Hulse, et al. 2022). PRT3789 will be evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with SMARCA4-mutant cancer. In order to assess target engagement following clinical administration of PRT3789, we developed two pharmacodynamic (PD) assays to measure SMARCA2 protein degradation and changes in SMARCA2 target gene expression in human peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We used the MSD&#174; S-PLEX platform for the development of a sensitive and quantitative, plate-based immunoassay for determining the protein concentration of SMARCA2 in human PBMC lysates. This assay exhibits a wide dynamic range of detection for SMARCA2 with an LLOD at 1.5 pg\/mL, as well as exhibiting acceptable spike recovery and minimal cross-reactivity to SMARCA4. In addition, we optimized the PBMC isolation protocol and lysis conditions to enable sensitive detection of SMARCA2 protein. In order to demonstrate downstream gene expression changes as a consequence of SMARCA2 protein degradation, we developed a secondary qPCR assay. PBMCs from healthy human donors were treated ex vivo with PRT3789 for 24 - 48 hours, followed by RNA-sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes. We refined an 8-gene panel that showed robust expression in PBMCs, as well as consistent and dose-dependent changes in response to PRT3789 treatment. We further calculated a differential gene expression (DGE) score based on expression of this gene panel that correlates with SMARCA2 protein degradation. In summary, we describe the development and characterization of two independent clinically relevant PD assays that can be used to evaluate target engagement in blood samples following PRT3789 administration.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacodynamics,Immunoassay,SWI\/SNF,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Andrew Moore<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Carly Bachner<sup>1<\/sup>, Lalitha Srinivasan<sup>2<\/sup>, Pradeep Kurup<sup>2<\/sup>, Alex Grego<sup>1<\/sup>, Caroline Vitkovitsky<sup>1<\/sup>, Koichi Ito<sup>1<\/sup>, Neha Bhagwat<sup>1<\/sup>, Peggy Scherle<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Prelude Therapeutics Incorporated, Wilmington, DE,<sup>2<\/sup>Meso Scale Discovery, Rockville, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d225e38c-095f-4ffc-94b5-e9c620661617","ControlNumber":"1402","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;A.

It is designed to have high plasma stability, low free payload in circulation and wide therapeutic index. Herein, the preclinical pharmacokinetics (PK) characteristics of DB-1303 in cynomolgus monkeys is reported, and human PK exposure in a first in human study was predicted using population PK model with allometric scaling.<br \/>Material and Methods: The PK parameters of DB-1303 were obtained from single PK and repeated TK studies in female and male cynomolgus monkeys. Concentrations of DB-1303 ADC, total antibody and released payload P1003 were measured using ELISA or LC-MS\/MS. In a PK study, single dose of DB-1303 at 1, 3 and 10 mg\/kg were determined in cynomolgus monkeys via IV infusion. In TK studies, cynomolgus monkeys were intravenously administered with DB-1303 at 50, 80 mg\/kg once every 3 weeks for 2 repeated doses, or 10, 40, 80 mg\/kg once every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 3 repeated doses followed by a 4-week recovery. A population PK model was developed based on the collective PK\/TK data in monkeys.<br \/>Results: The non-compartment analysis PK parameters of three analytes (DB-1303 ADC, total antibody and released payload P1003) are summarized following single and multiple doses of DB-1303 in cynomolgus monkeys. To predict the human PK for DB-1303, a target mediated drug disposition (TMDD) model was constructed, incorporating binding to serum HER2 and subsequent elimination of the complex into a standard 2-compartmental PK model. The 2-compartment linear parameters were scaled from cynomolgus monkey population PK parameters using allometric scaling exponents of 1 for volumes and 1 for clearance. The binding of DB-1303 to HER2 was incorporated into the model and assumed to be the same for HER2 ECD and transmembrane domain. The PK profiles for DB-1303 in human at the proposed doses in the first in human study are predicted. The safety margins from the monkey HNSTD for each proposed human dose are calculated.<br \/>Conclusions: DB-1303 exhibited favorable PK characteristics of DB-1303 in cynomolgus monkeys, and is predicted to have large safety margins at the selected doses in the first in human study.

AZD5305 demonstrated significant and sustained antitumor activity in multiple BRCA1\/2 mutant xenograft models. Here we present a mechanistic Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) model to analyze dose-dependent antitumor activity of AZD5305 (0.01-10 mg\/kg) across a selection of xenograft models with different homologous recombination repair (HRR) status (Capan-1, DLD-1 BRCA2 KO, HBCx-9, HBCx-17, MDA-MB-436 and SUM149PT). A QSP model was developed based on a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to address formation and repair of trapped PARP-DNA fragments and longitudinal changes in tumor size as a function of pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles in individual animals. Tumor growth data as well as intratumoral PARylation inhibition from xenograft models were utilized for model development and qualification. Model parameters characterizing intrinsic tumor growth and cancer cell sensitivity to accumulated DNA damage, were set to be different across xenograft models, to provide unbiased data reproduction. Sensitivity analyses were performed to identify model parameters which have the most impact on differential antitumor activity observed across various xenograft models. Maximal antitumor efficacy was seen at 0.1 to 1 mg\/kg AZD5305, depending on the tumor model. Exposures at 1 mg\/kg were similar to those causing peak PARP1 trapping <i>in vitro<\/i>. The QSP model adequately captures antitumor activity across different xenograft models. Simulations indicate antitumor activity of AZD5305 was driven mainly by differences in the HRR status-related model parameter (khrr). Xenograft models with HRR deficiency such as HBCx-17, DLD-1 BRCA2 KO and MDA-MB-436 (with a very low khrr) were the most sensitive to AZD5305 and treatment led to tumor regressions. In contrast, tumor models with partial sensitivity, such as HBCx-9, Capan-1, SUM149PT (with khrr up to 1000-fold higher than in the sensitive tumors), AZD5305 only achieved tumor growth inhibition. Dosing AZD5305 at 0.03 mg\/kg daily was associated with tumor regression in HBCx-17 and MDA-MB-436 xenografts, whereas 1 mg\/kg daily dosing was required to achieve tumor regression in the DLD-1 BRCA2 KO model, and maximal tumor growth inhibition in less sensitive models. Further biomarker analyses to assess functional HRR status (e.g. via RAD51 foci score) in these xenograft models is ongoing to validate model estimated khrr parameters. The calibrated model was used to predict antitumor activity of AZD5305 at clinically relevant exposures observed in the phase I clinical study PETRA. Model-based simulations indicated near maximal efficacy at clinical doses equivalent to 1 mg\/kg AZD5305 exposure in xenograft models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP inhibitors,BRCA,Modeling,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Ganesh Moorthy<sup>1<\/sup>, Veronika Voronova<sup>2<\/sup>, Cesar Pichardo<sup>3<\/sup>, Kirill Peskov<sup>2<\/sup>, Giuditta Illuzzi<sup>3<\/sup>, Anna Staniszewska<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Mark Albertella<\/b><sup>3<\/sup>, Holly Kimko<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>AstraZeneca, Waltham, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>M&S Decisions, Moscow, Russian Federation,<sup>3<\/sup>AstraZeneca, Cambridge, United Kingdom,<sup>4<\/sup>AstraZeneca, Gaithersburg, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8a023c2b-374f-41ce-ab2c-9599a31e81c8","ControlNumber":"4832","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;G.

RLY-4008 is a potent, highly selective and irreversible FGFR2 inhibitor designed to target both primary FGFR2 oncogenic alterations and clinically relevant resistance mutations. RLY-4008 is currently being studied in a Phase 1\/2 clinical trial to treat patients with FGFR2-driven CCA. To guide RLY-4008 dosing in cancer patients, we report here results from a clinical study to assess the effect of food and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) esomeprazole (ESO) on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of RLY-4008 in healthy subjects (HS).<br \/>Methods: This was a randomized, open-label, three-period, fed and fasted two-treatment crossover and fixed sequence, drug-drug interaction study to assess the effect of food and ESO on RLY-4008 PK. Twenty-four HS were enrolled to receive single oral doses of 50 mg RLY-4008 (fasted or fed with a high fat, high calorie meal) or RLY-4008 with ESO (fasted), with &#8805;7 days washout between each treatment. RLY-4008 PK was assessed up to 120 hours post dose. The effect of food and ESO was assessed using log-transformed RLY-4008 C<sub>max <\/sub>and AUC by linear mixed-effect modeling and calculating point estimates and associated 90% confidence intervals (CI) of geometric least squares mean ratios (LSGMR). Safety and tolerability were assessed through discharge\/end of study.<br \/>Results: Twenty-four HS were enrolled and completed the study. The median T<sub>max<\/sub> of RLY-4008 was similar when administered fasted, with food or with ESO. LSGMRs of C<sub>max<\/sub>, AUC<sub>(0-tlast)<\/sub> and AUC <sub>(0-inf) <\/sub>between RLY-4008 administered with food and fasted were 87%, 105%, and 106%, respectively, and the associated 90% CIs were 77-97%, 100-110%, and 100-110%, respectively. The LSGMRs and associated 90% CIs of AUCs were fully contained within 80% to 125%, while the lower bound of 90% confidence of C<sub>max<\/sub> LSGMR was below 80%. The 13% reduction in RLY-4008 C<sub>max<\/sub> with food was not considered clinically relevant. LSGMRs of C<sub>max<\/sub>, AUC<sub>(0-tlast)<\/sub> and AUC <sub>(0-inf) <\/sub>between RLY-4008 administered with ESO and alone were 110%, 113%, and 113%, respectively, and the associated 90% CIs were 102-119%, 109-117%, and 109-117%, respectively, and were fully contained within 80% to 125%. RLY-4008 was safe and well tolerated in HS when administered fasted, fed or with ESO.<br \/>Conclusion: Food and ESO does not have a clinically relevant effect on RLY-4008 PK in HS, indicating that RLY-4008 can be dosed with or without food and can be dosed with PPIs, H2-blockers and anti-acids in cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2  (FGFR-2),Inhibitors,Cholangiocarcinoma,Pharmacokinetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jinshan Shen<sup>1<\/sup>, Rishikesh Sawant<sup>1<\/sup>, Rick Blakesley<sup>1<\/sup>, Kai Yu Jen<sup>1<\/sup>, Fabien Ricard<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Xiaoyan Li<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Cassandra Key<sup>2<\/sup>, Djuro Karanovic<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Relay Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>ICON Plc, San Antonio, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e1bddd81-e27b-4b7b-a2ae-bfaf4b9c7c91","ControlNumber":"220","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

WEE1 inhibition increases genomic instability due to G2\/M checkpoint inactivation and can result in mitotic catastrophe as monotherapy or when combined with DNA damaging agents. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of ZN-c3, a best-in-class WEE1 inhibitor, in orthotopic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of GBM. Mice with intracranial tumors were randomized to 80 mg\/kg ZN-c3 PO QD x 2 weeks vs. placebo. ZN-c3 levels in plasma and contrast-enhancing tumor tissue were measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS). Unbound fractions were determined by equilibrium dialysis. Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess levels of pCDK1, phospho-Histone H3 (pHH3), and cleaved caspase 3 (CC3). The median unbound concentrations of ZN-c3 were 315 nmol\/L and 15 nmol\/kg in plasma and tumor tissue, respectively - higher than the biochemical IC<sub>50<\/sub> of ZN-c3 for inhibition of WEE1 (3.8nM). An increase in pHH3(+) cells (0.40% vs. 6.57%, p=0.03) indicated drug-induced mitotic entry upon ZN-c3 treatment. ZN-c3 was potently cytotoxic across multiple patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-derived cell lines (IC<sub>50<\/sub>- 150-10000nM). Time and dose-escalation experiments exhibited target engagement at concentrations lower than IC<sub>50<\/sub> values within one hour of treatment. Basal levels of WEE1 and pCDK1 were correlated with cell viability in response to ZN-c3 across multiple PDX cell lines. Overall, ZN-c3 is well tolerated, achieves pharmacologically-relevant unbound concentrations in GBM PDX models, and is associated with significant checkpoint modulation. Preclinical evaluation of ZN-c3 in combination with radiation therapy and DNA damage response pathway inhibitors is currently underway, which will support future combinatorial strategy for glioblastoma treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioma,WEE1,Pharmacodynamics,Pharmacokinetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shwetal Mehta<\/b><sup><\/sup>, An-Chi Tien<sup><\/sup>, Sonam Patel<sup><\/sup>, Tigran Margaryan<sup><\/sup>, Anilkumar Thaghalli Shivanna<sup><\/sup>, Leonel Elena<sup><\/sup>, Jennifer Molloy<sup><\/sup>, William Knight<sup><\/sup>, Ruiheng Hon<sup><\/sup>, Mackenna Elliott<sup><\/sup>, Mariya Stavnichuk<sup><\/sup>, Zorana Opachich<sup><\/sup>, Yu-Wei Chang<sup><\/sup>, Chelsea Montgomery<sup><\/sup>, Sarah Himes<sup><\/sup>, Barbara Hopkins<sup><\/sup>, Artak Tovmasyan<sup><\/sup>, Nader Sanai<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"489219a7-f145-40f2-b8f5-2b30f184960c","ControlNumber":"3072","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

However, there are limited data on Pemb use in older adults aged &#62;75 years with NSCLC, especially in terms of pharmacokinetics (PK).<br \/>Methods: This open-label multicenter observational study aimed to evaluate real-world data on the safety, efficacy, and blood concentrations of Pemb (both monotherapy and combination therapies) in older adults with NSCLC. Blood samples for PK analysis were collected immediately before Pemb administration. Quantitative Pemb concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.<br \/>Results: We enrolled 100 patients from July 2019 to September 2020; one patient was excluded due to stage migration. Patient characteristics were as follows: median age, 78 (75-87) years; male\/female ratio, 70\/29; performance status (PS) 0-1\/2-3, 85\/14; adenocarcinoma\/squamous cell carcinoma\/others, 62\/25\/12; stage I-III\/IV\/postoperative recurrence (TNM 7th edition), 9\/60\/30; PD-L1 TPS &#60;1%\/1%-49%\/&#8805;50%, 12\/31\/48; and monotherapy\/combination therapy, 65\/34. The best overall efficacy was CR\/PR\/SD\/PD (7\/40\/32\/20), and the response rate was 47.5%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 8.0 and 19.0 months, respectively. The adverse event profile was generally similar to that reported in previous studies. In total, 77 blood samples were collected immediately before the second cycle (C1 trough). Although no clear association between Pemb concentrations and patient background was found, PFS and OS were significantly shortened in the population with low C1 trough, a population characterized by lower PS, high number of metastatic organs at the beginning of treatment, and low blood albumin level.<br \/>Conclusion: In older adults aged &#62;75 years with NSCLC and low albumin levels and PS and a high number of metastatic organs, C1 trough of Pemb is reduced and not expected to prolong PFS and OS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacokinetics,Age,Immunology,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yoshiro Nakahara<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kageaki Watanabe<sup>2<\/sup>, Yukio Hosomi<sup>2<\/sup>, Yuta Yamanaka<sup>3<\/sup>, Takayasu Kurata<sup>3<\/sup>, Hidehito Horinouchi<sup>4<\/sup>, Yuichiro Ohe<sup>4<\/sup>, Tetsuhiko Asao<sup>5<\/sup>, Sho Saeki<sup>6<\/sup>, Yukari Tsubata<sup>7<\/sup>, Yu Fujita<sup>8<\/sup>, Jun Sakakibara Konishi<sup>9<\/sup>, Hidenori Mizugaki<sup>10<\/sup>, Mayu Ohuchi<sup>11<\/sup>, Shigehiro Yagishita<sup>12<\/sup>, Akinobu Hamada<sup>12<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kitasato University School of Medicine, Sagamihara, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Respiratory Medicine, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Thoracic Oncology, Kansai Medical University Hospital, Hirakata, Japan,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Respiratory Medicine, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Respiratory Medicine, Juntendo University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>6<\/sup>Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kumamoto University Hospital, Kumamoto, Japan,<sup>7<\/sup>Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology and Respiratory Medicine, Shimane University Faculty of Medicine, Izumo, Japan,<sup>8<\/sup>Department of Translational Research for Exosomes, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>9<\/sup>Department of Respiratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan,<sup>10<\/sup>Advanced medical Development Center, Cancer Institute Hospital of JFCR, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>11<\/sup>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Fundamental Innovative Oncology Core, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>12<\/sup>Division of Molecular Pharmacology, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"fd31e605-da39-4f9f-92fc-c22f20cc9622","ControlNumber":"2670","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;Y.

For T-cell engagers, CRS is a potential adverse event. Step-up dosing (SUD) is used to mitigate potential severe CRS symptoms. Identification of optimal SUD is challenging because multiple steps of dose escalation are needed to manage CRS. Based on a dose-escalation study of epcoritamab, 2-step SUD (weekly priming and intermediate dose prior to administering the target dose) was necessary to effectively mitigate the risk of CRS. A wide range of priming (0.004-0.16 mg) and intermediate (0.0128-1.6 mg) doses for 17 combinations was explored; the 0.16\/0.8\/48-mg regimen was selected based on the CRS event rate. We further explored optimization of the SUD regimen using a model-based approach to inform clinical evaluation.<br \/>Methods: A repeated time-to-event model was developed using pharmacokinetic and CRS event data collected in the phase 1\/2 EPCORE NHL-1 monotherapy trial. The model was required to predict the onset of 1 or more CRS events (all-grade and grade &#8805;2) over time and to describe the impact of epcoritamab concentration on CRS risk over time and the development of tolerance after multiple doses. To capture these dynamics, the hazard function (risk of CRS event) was modeled as the product of 2 components: the first component addressed the risk of a CRS event and allowed for increasing hazard with increasing epcoritamab plasma concentrations, and the second component described the inhibition of the hazard to capture development of CRS tolerance over time after multiple doses. Simulations assessed the performance of different SUD regimens, measured by the probability of a grade &#8805;2 CRS event.<br \/>Results: The model was able to predict the observed CRS events over time and confirmed that the SUD regimen used in the recommended phase 2 dose regimen for epcoritamab (0.16\/0.8\/48 mg) provided similar or better potential to reduce the risk of grade &#8805;2 CRS events versus other priming and intermediate dose permutations tested during dose escalation in the EPCORE NHL-1 trial. The validated model was used to further explore a large number of SUD regimens not studied in clinical trials. Based on model predictions, alternative SUD regimens can potentially lead to a small reduction in risk of grade &#8805;2 CRS. To further assess this, alternative SUD regimens were selected for potential clinical assessment.<br \/>Conclusions: A dynamic model for CRS was successfully developed, validated, and applied to aid the optimization of an epcoritamab SUD regimen. The model-based optimization of SUD informed and narrowed down the number of doses\/cohorts to be tested in clinical trials, simplified study design, and played a critical role in expediting the optimization of the epcoritamab SUD regimen.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Modeling,Pharmacodynamics,Pharmacokinetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tommy Li<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Daniel Polhamus<sup>2<\/sup>, Craig Thalhauser<sup>1<\/sup>, Apurvasena Parikh<sup>3<\/sup>, Manish Gupta<sup>1<\/sup>, Mariana Sacchi<sup>1<\/sup>, Steven Xu<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Genmab, Princeton, NJ,<sup>2<\/sup>Metrum Research Group, Tariffville, CT,<sup>3<\/sup>AbbVie, South San Francisco, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"631f0598-06de-40cf-b4ac-0240ef131102","ControlNumber":"3937","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;T.

TGF-&#223;1 binds TGF-&#223; receptor 2, which recruits and phosphorylates TGF-&#223; receptor 1 (TGFBR1). TGFBR1 in turn phosphorylates SMAD2 and SMAD3. Phosphorylated SMAD2\/3 (pSMAD2\/3) complexes with SMAD4 to translocate to the nucleus and enact transcriptional programs. In late-stage tumors, TGF-&#223; signaling is oncogenic, promoting growth, invasion, immune suppression, tissue remodeling, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT).<br \/>In an effort to counter the oncogenic effects of TGF-&#223; signaling, Sumitomo Pharma Oncology, Inc. is developing TP-6379, an investigational, orally available, small molecule, selective TGFBR1 inhibitor. TP-6379 has a biochemical IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 1.07 nM and has been shown to reduce pSMAD2 in Rhabdomyosarcoma cells with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 108 nM. A dose dependent increase of TP-6379 was observed in plasma and tumors of A549 tumor bearing athymic nude mice (10, 50, 75, and 100 mg\/kg PO). In another study using the same mouse model, pSMAD2 has shown an inverse correlation with pharmacokinetics showing &#62; 90% inhibition for up to 4 hours (75 mg\/kg PO).<br \/>Pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers are critical for determining biological activity, but procuring serial tumor biopsies for PD analysis is challenging for many tumor types. We hypothesize that pSMAD2 can be measured in non-tumor tissues as a surrogate for activity within the tumor. Surrogate tissues, such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), skin punches, and even circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are much less invasive and can be sampled over multiple timepoints. We observed a measurable decrease of PD biomarkers pSMAD2\/3 in PBMCs and skin after treatment with TP-6379 using a bead-based immunoassay (Luminex). Healthy human donor PBMCs treated <i>ex vivo<\/i> for 2 hours with up to 1 &#181;M TP-6379 showed a 96% reduction in pSMAD2\/3 signal. Although TP-6379 was still active in reducing pSMAD2 in PBMCs when treated in whole blood for 2 hours, it required around 30-fold more drug to achieve a similar effect, possibly due to serum protein binding. Skin samples from <i>in vivo<\/i> dosed tumor bearing mice also show significant inhibition of pSMAD2\/3, which correlated with significant pSMAD2\/3 inhibition in tumors from both EMT6 and 4T1 syngeneic triple-negative breast cancer mouse tumor models. We confirmed that the Luminex assay is sensitive enough to reliably measure pSMAD2\/3 in healthy human doner skin punches down to 3 mm in diameter. Lastly, CTCs from breast cancer patients&#8217; whole blood treated <i>ex vivo<\/i> for 24 hours with as low as 1 &#181;M TP-6379 showed a decrease in pSMAD2 and EMT marker SNAI1 by as much as 96% and 86%, respectively, when measured by immunofluorescence.<br \/>In summary, our research has shown that pSMAD2\/3 and EMT marker SNAI1 are valid PD biomarkers for TP-6379 therapy. We propose that these biomarkers would be best measured clinically using PBMCs, CTCs and\/or skin punches.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacodynamics,Biomarkers,TGF-&#946;,Smad,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Richard  E.

An ongoing phase 1 trial has finished the escalation phase, and we report the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of oral (PO) triapine.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: This phase 1 study followed a 3+3 design for dose escalation of oral triapine, starting with initial dose of 100 mg five days a week for five weeks combined with external beam pelvic radiation and weekly IV cisplatin.

The correlation of PO Vz\/F vs Cl\/F was high at R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.86, suggesting that the apparent clearance and volume variability is primarily due to variability in the oral bioavailability F. PO within patient variability of C<sub>max<\/sub> and AUC was also large at 43% and 55%. IV PK was less variable with lower geometric standard deviations across all parameters, including within patients where variability of C<sub>max<\/sub> and AUC was modest at 10 and 12% coefficient of variation, respectively. Oral bioavailability was estimated at 66%. We found a non-significant trend of smoking almost doubling triapine oral clearance from 68 to 156 L\/h (p=0.056). There was no apparent relationship between occurrence of DLT and either IV or PO triapine AUC. Methemoglobin levels directly correlated with triapine exposure expressed as AUC or Cmax.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: Triapine PK parameter values for PO and IV administration and PO bioavailability values observed in this trial were comparable to previous reports. Correlation of methemoglobin with exposure highlights the importance of optimizing triapine exposure.

The trial&#8217;s ultimate goal is to rationally optimize the dosing of the anti-cancer drug, Vincristine (VCR).<br \/>The CYP3A5 enzyme more efficiently metabolizes VCR to its M1 metabolite than the CYP3A4 enzyme as reported by Renbarger. CYP3A5 expression varies among Kenyans (90%), African Americans (AA, 70%), and Caucasians (10-20%). In order to dose the patients rationally among the different ethnicities, the pre-requisite is to comprehensively understand the pharmacokinetic (PK) disposition of VCR and M1, as well as the conversion kinetics from VCR to M1.<br \/>Seventy-seven (77) Kenyan pediatric cancer patients (37M\/40F, 1-16 yo, BSA of 0.38-1.64 m<sup>2<\/sup>) with 9 types of cancers, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL, N=28), and Non-Hodgkin&#8217;s Lymphoma (NHL, N=21), Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL, N=5), Wilm&#8217;s Tumor (WT\/NEPHRO, N=13), Retinoblastoma (RETINO, N=5), Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS, N=2), Hepatoma (HEPATO, N=1), Teratoma (TERA, N=1), and Neuroblastoma (NEURO, N=1) were recruited. Dried blood spot (DBS) samples of the Kenyan pediatric patients after an IV dose of VCR (0.9-2.2 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>) were collected via finger stick at various time points depending on the feasibility. Concentrations were quantified for VCR and M1 using a validated LC-MS\/MS assay with LLOQ of 0.6 ng\/ml for VCR and 0.4 ng\/ml for M1. The PK co-models of VCR and M1 metabolite were developed, and PK parameters were derived for individual subjects. Using Phoenix NLME 8.0, model discrimination was performed by minimizing the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) values and visual comparisons of the quality of fitness of the plots. The PK parameters were derived from the best fit PK model. Large interpatient variability was observed.

Expression of the transcription factor PPARG is associated with the luminal lineage subtype, which accounts for two-thirds of all advanced urothelial cancer (UC) patients. Taking into consideration the difficulty in obtaining sequential tumor biopsies in late-stage cancer patients, the feasibility of an accessible, less invasive surrogate tissue to evaluate PD biomarkers that support proof of mechanism of drug action, clinical proof of concept and ultimately the selection of optimal dosing, was evaluated. FX-909, a covalent PPARG inverse agonist is projected to initiate Phase 1 clinical studies in 2023 aimed at serving patients with advanced UC. In vivo UMUC9 UC xenograft model efficacy studies were performed in NGC mice treated with FX-909 at 0.03 mg\/kg to 1 mg\/kg BID for 21 days. Preclinical pharmacology studies were performed in Sprague Dawley male rats treated with FX-909 at 3, 10 and 30 mg\/kg BID for 28 days to investigate potential biomarkers associated with on-target effects of FX-909. Ex vivo cultured human skin explant models derived from donors undergoing abdominoplasty procedures were utilized to bridge the interspecies translational gap to test the effect of FX-909 on human tissue. Tumor tissue from mouse xenografts, as well as inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and skin tissue were collected. Changes in known PPARG target gene expression were measured by qPCR and transcriptomic differences by RNA-Seq. A subset of genes exhibited similar dose dependent trends in rat skin and adipose tissues, including known PPARG targets such as, <i>Rbp4<\/i>, <i>Cidea<\/i> and <i>Ivd<\/i>, fitting the expected decreasing exponential curve. Overall, 30% of all genes that responded to FX-909 treatment in skin displayed a similar dose-dependent response profile in iWAT with median Pearson correlations ranging from r=0.33-0.92, exemplified by the <i>Ivd<\/i> correlation, r=0.91 [p-value&#60;0.0002], where approximately 50% gene suppression was observed at the lowest dose level. Importantly in UMUC9 models, dose-dependent suppression of <i>FABP4<\/i>\/<i>Fabp4<\/i> target gene showed strong correlation [r=0.98, p-value=0.003] between tumor and skin tissues. Based on these preclinical data and confirmatory experiments in the ex vivo setting, a novel FX-909 signature is under development to predict target modulation in the tumor. The consistent correlation of PPARG target gene suppression in tumor and normal tissues across species provide a strong rationale for a surrogate biospecimen collection, such as a skin punch biopsy, to establish the PK\/PD relationship between the dose and response to FX-909 in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacodynamics,PPARG,Urothelial cancer,Surrogate biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jennifer  A.

BTM-3566 is effective on all types of DLBCL, independent of cell of origin (COO) or genotype. Drug activity depends on activation of the mitochondrial protease OMA1 followed by activation of HRI and induction of the ATF4 ISR. To ascertain whether ATF4 ISR induction occurs <i>in vivo<\/i>, we determined the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) responses of BTM-3566 in mouse xenograft models of DLBCL using the double hit lymphoma SU-DHL-10. To establish PK parameters, tumor bearing mice were dosed orally for 1 or 5 consecutive days with 20 mg\/kg BTM-3566 and blood sampled over 28 hours. Plasma levels of BTM-3566 were determined and analyzed using a non-compartment model. Half-life in blood plasma was 5.4 and 4.5 hours on days 1 and 5 respectively. Total exposure (AUC<sub>inf<\/sub>) was 524164 and 429485 hr*nM on day 1 and day 5 respectively. Drug AUC<sub>inf<\/sub> in tumor after a single oral dose of BTM-3566 was 151260 hr*nM. Free drug was estimated to be above the free IC<sub>90<\/sub> for approximately 16 hours post-dose in both plasma and tumor. PD responses to BTM-3566 treatment were determined by measuring biomarkers of the therapeutic cascade: OPA1 cleavage is used as a surrogate for target engagement and activation of OMA1; increased phosphorylation of eIF2&#945; represents pathway activation; induction of ATF4 regulated transcripts and the decrease in the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1 represent pathway effect. A single 20\/mg\/kg dose of BTM-3566 on day 1 resulted in cleavage of OPA1 by 0.5 hour, with maximal cleavage seen by 12 hours. Phosho-eIF2&#945; was observed by 0.5 hours, peaking at 6 hours. Induction of the ATF4 transcripts ATF4, DDIT3, TRIB3, and CDKN1A was observed within 2 hours with a maximum at 6-12 hours followed by a reduction in transcript levels. MCL1 protein levels were reduced consistent with suppression of translation and protein turnover. By day 5, repeat dosing shows evidence of cumulative pathway effects: OPA1 is extensively cleaved; despite generally depressed levels, phosphorylation of eIF2&#945; remains dynamic and MCL1 levels are markedly suppressed. Induction of ATF4 transcripts, however, follow largely the same kinetics as seen on day 1. The data suggests that <i>in vivo<\/i> anti-tumor activity of BTM-3566 is associated with activation of the mitochondrial protease OMA1 and induction of the ATF4 ISR. Robust tumor regression is correlated with both blood plasma levels of BTM-3566 and induction of the ATF4 ISR pathway. The data support the use of both ATF4 transcripts and OPA1 cleavage as robust PD markers of target engagement and pathway effect in human clinical trials. An Investigational New Drug application for BTM3566 in B-cell malignancies has been approved with initiation of first in human clinical trials planned for spring 2023.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-05 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacodynamics,Pharmacokinetics,Mitochondria,Stress response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Azadeh Bagherzadeh<sup>1<\/sup>, Jennifer Baker<sup>1<\/sup>, Charlotte Bennett<sup>1<\/sup>, Mi-Young Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Natalia Pacheco<sup>1<\/sup>, Bhavisha Patel<sup>1<\/sup>, Kevin Stewart<sup>1<\/sup>, Jon Travers<sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Stocum<sup>2<\/sup>, Todd Hembrough<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Matthew Kostura<\/b><sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Cancer Research Horizons, Cambridge, United Kingdom,<sup>2<\/sup>Bantam Pharmaceutical, Research Triangle Park, NC","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"15367f42-8ac9-4cb6-819c-84b2040adae2","ControlNumber":"2570","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;A.

First, a perfusable channel is constructed within a gelatin composite extracellular matrix (ECM) using a sacrificial material-assisted 3D embedded printing technology. Next, the channel is seeded with <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutated NCI-H23 LUAD (derived from a Black patient) or hAEC-C7 (untransformed, immortalized human alveolar epithelial cells) respectively, and exposed to drugs to test the anti-cancer efficacy.

We expect further studies for precision medicine by novel analysis and cohort expansion.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET07-04 Pharmacogenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pharmacogenomics,Patient-derived cell,EGFR-TKI,Small cell lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Charny Park<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Namhee Yu<sup><\/sup>, Mihwa Hwang\u0009<sup><\/sup>, Youngjoo Lee\u0009<sup><\/sup>, Bo Ram Song<sup><\/sup>, Eun Hye Kang<sup><\/sup>, Hanna Sim<sup><\/sup>, Beung-Chul Ahn\u0009<sup><\/sup>, Kum Hui Hwang<sup><\/sup>, Sehwa Hong\u0009<sup><\/sup>, Sunshin Kim\u0009<sup><\/sup>, Ji-Youn Han\u0009<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>National Cancer Center - Korea, Ilsan, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7eb8b263-8027-4c89-8bc0-fdc2e26f2c4a","ControlNumber":"4144","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.
