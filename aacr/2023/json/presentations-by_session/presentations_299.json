[{"Abstract":"In 2005, we introduced the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) method to enable the identification and estimation of significance of activated biological pathways and processes in molecular data. Serving a community of over 300,000 registered users, and contributing scientific analysis to more than 30,000 publications, GSEA has become ubiquitous in gene expression analysis and particularly in cancer research. The power of GSEA relies, in a large part, on the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) that provides tens of thousands of expertly curated and annotated gene sets representing cellular processes, canonical pathways, response signatures, etc., derived from prior studies, public data, and curated pathway databases. Here we describe an important recent addition to the GSEA\/MSigDB resource.<br \/>Historically, the GSEA-MSigDB resource has focused specifically on human data, offering guidance and support for analysis of model organism data through limited provision of orthology mapping files. In recognition of the importance of the mouse as a model organism for cancer research, we recently significantly expanded our support for mouse data in two ways.<br \/>(1) We introduced Mouse MSigDB with a total of about 15,000 sets that are provided in the native mouse gene symbol space and are derived from published mouse datasets and mouse-focused resources. This allows GSEA analysis of mouse datasets without the need for orthology conversion.<br \/>(2) For investigators who wish to use MSigDB&#8217;s human gene sets to analyze mouse data, or vice versa, we also implemented a new procedure for orthology mapping gene identifiers in an input dataset to match the identifiers of the gene sets. The new mapping considers the particular requirements of gene set enrichment analysis, and incorporates high confidence gene ortholog data from the Alliance of Genome Resources and ortholog-match refinement utilizing Ensembl&#8217;s ortholog datasets.<br \/>Together, these new additions offer a substantial step forward for making mouse a first-class citizen of the GSEA-MSigDB ecosystem. The new Mouse MSigDB, and the full GSEA-MSigDB resource, is available at gsea-msigdb.org.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Gene expression analysis,Gene set enrichment analysis,Molecular signatures,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anthony  S.

To aid precision medicine through public interpretations, a multifaceted collaborative effort is required to bring together a community, structured guidance, and a public platform. The over 200 multi-disciplinary experts in the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Somatic Cancer Clinical Domain Working Group (CDWG) provide a community that develops data curation guidelines and standards and curates evidence to determine the clinical significance and oncogenicity of somatic alterations in cancer. The Somatic CDWG established the Pediatric Cancer, Hematological Cancer, and Solid Tumor Taskforces to facilitate membership growth and targeted curation projects. Within these Taskforces, Somatic Cancer Variant Curation Expert Panels (SC-VCEPs) are developed through a 4-step approval process adapted from ClinGen germline VCEP procedures. Five SC-VCEPs (NTRK-fusions, FGFR variants, FLT3 variants, Histone H3 variants, and BCR::ABL1-like B-ALL alterations) are working through the approval process and one (Established Significance) is in the planning stage. SC-VCEPs tailor AMP\/ASCO\/CAP [PMID:27993330] and ClinGen\/CGC\/VICC Oncogenicity [PMID:35101336] guidelines, or create new classification guidance to aid granular assessment of their genomic alterations of interest.<br \/>The Clinical Interpretations of Variants in Cancer (CIViC) knowledgebase provides the public platform for the Taskforces and SC-VCEPs to display their high-quality somatic cancer variant interpretations. These groups curate evidence from published literature and create Assertions summarizing evidence collected. These Assertions are further disseminated through other resources like ClinVar and the Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium (VICC) MetaKB. CIViC supports the application of AMP\/ASCO\/CAP tiering and levels for clinical significance Assertions. CIViC recently created Oncogenic Assertions, which supports the application of ClinGen\/CGC\/VICC codes. Three SC-VCEPs (FGFR, FLT3, and Histone H3) are tailoring the ClinGen\/CGC\/VICC Oncogenicity guidelines to their specific genes and CIViC will enable their ClinGen-approved, modified codes to be applied directly to their Oncogenic Assertions. Also, two SC-VCEPs (NTRK and BCR::ABL1-like) are developing fusion specific oncogenicity classification guidelines, which will be applied to their fusion specific CIViC Oncogenic Assertions. ClinGen Somatic groups have generated 695 CIViC Evidence Items and 33 Assertions from over 400 published papers. These numbers will continue to grow along with the development of more SC-VCEPs. ClinGen Somatic and CIViC foster collaboration, innovation, and most importantly the advancement of precision medicine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-04 Database resources,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Databases,Oncogene,Genomics,Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jason Saliba<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Arpad Danos<sup>1<\/sup>, Kilannin Krysiak<sup>1<\/sup>, Adam Coffman<sup>1<\/sup>, Susanna Kiwala<sup>1<\/sup>, Joshua McMichael<sup>1<\/sup>, Cameron  J.

While genetic mechanisms of primary tumors and, to a lesser extent, metastatic cancers have been studied in large cohorts, refractory metastatic tumors are not yet sufficiently characterized. Markers of aggressiveness and resistance that molecular profiling can extract from these tumors have yet to be identified and incorporated into clinical care. In this study, we present a pan-cancer cohort of 1,031 metastatic tumors (which we refer to as META-PRISM) that are resistant to at least one systemic therapy or with no approved treatment options. We retrieved the complete clinical history of patients and performed whole-exome (n=571) and transcriptome sequencing (n=947) for this cohort. The prevalence of detected cancer biomarkers was assessed and compared to an external cohort of primary tumors. In the META-PRISM cohort, we observed an increase in (i) whole-genome duplication frequency, (ii) tumor mutational burden, (iii) germline cancer-predisposing variants, and (iv) somatic alterations in cancer genes, including KRAS, EGFR, CCND1, MYC, and TP53, as compared to the tumor type-matched primary tumors. The most extensive increase in genomic variation at metastatic stage was observed in prostate bladder, and pancreatic cancer types. We also identified enrichment of standard-of-care resistance biomarkers in most cancer types. However, only 9.3% of tumors harbored at least one such biomarker, indicating that the current understanding of resistance mechanisms remains insufficient. Our cohort demonstrated a significantly improved 6-month survival prediction from models incorporating molecular markers over models with only clinical markers for breast cancer patients and to a lesser extent for other studied tumor types. Overall, our data establish a unique resource for investigating treatment resistance mechanisms and performing predictive analyses in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-04 Database resources,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastatic tumors,Drug resistance,Survival,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yoann Pradat<sup>1<\/sup>, Julien Viot<sup>2<\/sup>, Konstantin Gunbin<sup>2<\/sup>, Andrey Yurchenko<sup>2<\/sup>, Luigi Cerbone<sup>2<\/sup>, Marc Deloger<sup>2<\/sup>, Guillaume Grisay<sup>2<\/sup>, Loic Verlingue<sup>2<\/sup>, Véronique Scott<sup>2<\/sup>, Ismael Padioleau<sup>2<\/sup>, Leonardo Panunzi<sup>2<\/sup>, Stefan Michiels<sup>2<\/sup>, Antoine Hollebecque<sup>2<\/sup>, Gerome Jules-Clément<sup>2<\/sup>, Laura Mezquita<sup>2<\/sup>, Antoine Lainé<sup>1<\/sup>, Yohann Loriot<sup>2<\/sup>, Benjamin Besse<sup>2<\/sup>, Luc Friboulet<sup>2<\/sup>, Fabrice André<sup>2<\/sup>, Paul-Henry Cournède<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Daniel Gautheret<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sergey Nikolaev<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Université Paris-Saclay, Gif-Sur-Yvette, France,<sup>2<\/sup>Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"32d4ed1c-66a7-42ed-992c-0d23c3b7d3c8","ControlNumber":"3926","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

It is a highly heterogeneous and complex diseases with multiple molecular events occurring during cancer initiation and progression. It is important to unravel the heterogeneity of breast cancer and the molecular events to develop diagnostic biomarkers and targeted therapies. There is need for comprehensive and user-friendly tool for the utilization of available breast cancer data including metastatic and treatment response data. We have earlier created a highly used pan-cancer proteogenomic portal called UALCAN (ualcan.path.uab.edu). Based on the current unmet need for comprehensive BC data analysis and visualization resource, we developed an integrated proteo-genomicbreast cancer data analysis portal, called Mammonc-DB <b>(<\/b>http:\/\/resource.path.uab.edu\/MammOnc-ge.html)<b>.<\/b> For Mammonc-DB, we collected data from public repositories like NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for collecting and analysis of genomics and epigenetics data, and, PRIDE, and, ProteomeXchange for proteomics data. We procured and processed multi-omics studies related to normal, primary, and metastatic human breast cancer data with other clinical information available, for different clinical models. We also collected and analyzed different therapy, and treatment studies that are currently employed in treating BC patients. Mammonc-DB has user friendly interface that aid breast cancer researchers and clinicians in, a) allows users to identify potential biomarkers in breast cancer, b) accessing publicly available breast cancer multi-omics data, c) Visualizing the expression pattern of gene or protein of interest with clinical feature stratification in each dataset among others This resource serves as a one-stop resource to study gene expression (protein-coding and non-coding) analysis along with epigenetic regulation, and protein expression patterns in BC. With this platform, we tend to create global user base that will accelerate discovery of biomarkers in BC that might be involved in diagnosis, therapeutic target identification and treatments of breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-04 Database resources,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Biomarkers,Bioinformatics,Databases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Santhosh Kumar Karthikeyan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Darshan S.

However, our internal survey results suggested that some knowledge and data sources were underused or underestimated by researchers. One primary reason is that knowledge of drug combinations is scattered in many distinct databases. Moreover, some essential information, such as MTD and DLT was missed in current databases. Drug Combo (https:\/\/drugcombo.shinyapps.io\/DrugCombo\/) is the first knowledge base that integrates drug toxicity and PK data that may help design an efficient Phase I trial. It is a unique informatics resource that manually curated MTD and DLT are well organized in the knowledgebase.<br \/>Methods: Drug Combo integrates various publicly available PK and toxicity knowledge for individual drugs and drug combinations (Table 1). More importantly, it is the unique knowledgebase with MTD and DLT. An expert team manually curated MTD and DLT data from publicly available publications. Some standard healthcare terminologies, e.g., Rx-Norm and MedDRA were applied for concept normalization at the back end. We implemented a User-Centered Design process in the user interface (UI).The UI layout will be simple, consistent, purposeful, comprehensive, easy to navigate and informative with readable or scannable typography. A summary view was provided to inform users of some essential information, e.g., MTD, and Overlapping toxicities.

However, developing robust and reproducible predictive gene signatures for ICIs remains a challenge partly due to the lack of systematic comparisons across a large pan-cancer transcriptomics compendia. We recently developed Immuno-Oncology Signatures Explorer (IOSig), a user-friendly web tool, to allow users to query and explore predictive biomarkers from a large collection of pan-cancer patient samples treated with ICIs (&#62; 2500 patient samples from 40 studies). Here, we investigated six solid tumors: kidney, melanoma, bladder, head and neck squamous cell, gastrointestinal, and non-small cell lung cancers tissue-based RNA-seq datasets in IOSig. The 2175 samples, from 45 cohorts, were Z-normalized with the genes from each signature being averaged to assign a sample a single score per signature. Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve was used to summarize the gene signatures&#8217; ability to predict response to ICIs. We focus on the top 10 predictive gene signatures for each cancer type. There were 22 unique gene signatures from the top 10 of the six cancer types. Overall, 17 signatures were predictive in GI, NSCLC, melanoma and HNSCC. Many of these signatures were enriched in immune activation and inflammatory signatures. Conversely, the MYC, DNA damage repair, and proliferation signatures are only predictive in bladder cancer. No predictive signatures were associated with kidney cancer. Interestingly, the immune activation signatures were highly predictive in the GI cancer cohorts in our study, as the cohorts were enriched with patients having high tumor mutational burdens and microsatellite instability. In summary, we used IOSig to analyze the predictive ability of previously published gene signatures across 6 cancer types. Some of these signatures warrant further investigation in a cancer-specific manner.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\"

To realize this potential and make analysis and visualization of these complex and interconnected data easily accessible to cancer biologists and clinicians, we have developed a web portal, LinkedOmicsKB. The web portal provides access to a harmonized proteogenomic dataset of over 1000 patient samples covering 10 cancer cohorts from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). We calculated associations between methylation, copy number variation (CNV), RNA, protein, and phosphosite data for each gene and further correlated the proteogenomics data with clinical and computed molecular phenotypes. All results are stored in a MongoDB database and visualizations are provided for exploring pan-cancer multi-omics relationships as well as individual statistics. We demonstrate the utility of LinkedOmicsKB to provide insights into clinical phenotypes, somatic mutations, and understudied genes. In the pan-cancer CPTAC data, overall survival was correlated with proteins involved in protein hydroxylation, including PLOD1 and PLOD2. Additionally, two phosphorylation sites on the tumor suppressor MIG-6 were associated with worse survival. These sites were also associated with hypoxia, MAPK, and EGFR pathway activity scores, suggesting a relationship between the signaling in these pathways and cancer prognosis. STK17B is an understudied kinase that regulates apoptosis. We found STK17B was upregulated in 6 cancer types at the protein level but only two at the RNA level. The protein abundance of STK17B was highly associated with immune scores and JAK\/STAT signaling, supporting a role for STK17B in the immune response. We identified 3 phosphorylation sites on STK17B, which were associated with EGF pathway activity scores and immune-related scores.

This includes both pediatric cancer cohorts and structure birth defect cohorts, as co-occurrences of these suggest a shared context of developmental biology alterations. Making this quantity of data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) to researchers around the world has been enabled via the Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource Center (KFDRC). Twenty-six Kids First studies are released on the Kids First Data Resource Portal, representing more than 21,000 participants and more than 1.25 PB of data, with additional datasets being released yearly. Additionally, via a partnership between NCI Childhood Cancer Data Initiative and Kids First, large studies currently undergoing sequencing on childhood sarcomas and brain tumors will also be made available via the KFDRC.<br \/>The KFDRC Portal (<u>https:\/\/portal.kidsfirstdrc.org\/<\/u><u><\/u>) provides an interactive cohort building interface as well as powerful search capabilities across 61 billion germline variants in real-time. The somatic variants are made available on the open-access PedcBioPortal (<u>https:\/\/pedcbioportal.kidsfirstdrc.org\/<\/u><u><\/u>). Search features include leveraging ontologies to enable different granularity across studies to be cross-querable. The use of these ontologies enable semantic interoperability, while also leveraging FHIR as an interoperable standard for exchange of clinical and other relevant metadata. GA4GH DRS and Passport services via Gen3 and NIH&#8217;s Researcher Authentication Service (RAS) enable streamlined access to controlled access data within researchers&#8217; cloud platform of choice, including CAVATICA (<u>https:\/\/cavatica.org<\/u><u><\/u>) which is directly integrated with the KFDRC Portal.&nbsp;<br \/>The KFDRC is part of the NIH Cloud-Based Platform Interoperability efforts, which includes the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons.

Most genomic alterations are accurately annotated with tools such as the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) that infer the effects of these alterations on the mRNA and protein by following basic rules of transcription, mRNA post-transcriptional processing, and translation. However, some genomic variants are not as easily captured by these rules, which can cause inappropriate or unclear annotation of the protein effect. For example, a variant that alters an existing splice site or creates a new one can activate or inactivate the protein. Similarly, specific mutations in the non-coding promoter region of a gene may de-regulate gene expression (e.g., TERT promoter mutations). In some instances, these so-called variants with unexpected effects (VUE) may have therapeutic implications. For example, while ~2-3% of GIST tumors harbor KIT exon 11 deletions that extend into the non-coding intron between exons 10 and 11 and are shown to cause in-frame deletions, they are typically misclassified as inactivating splice site mutations, precluding patients with tumors harboring these mutations from receiving standard care imatinib.<br \/>Thus, while many VUEs are functionally characterized and documented in the literature, there are no resources to systematically identify, curate and store these events such that they can be correctly annotated in routine clinical sequencing leading to suboptimal treatment decisions.<br \/>To address this unmet clinical need, we built a novel bioinformatic resource, the Repository for Variants with Unexpected Effects (reVUE - cancerrevue.org). The reVUE resource consists of (1) an intuitive website listing curated VUEs with their observed effects as demonstrated by functional characterization in peer-reviewed literature and (2) an application programming interface (API) for programmatic annotation of variants. We built reVUE as a crowd-sourced resource to enable contributions of VUEs to the repository from the clinical and scientific communities. Both the software and data are openly available. Our goal is to enable clinical bioinformatic pipelines to accurately annotate all DNA mutations, including those with unanticipated protein coding effects, some of which can have therapeutic implications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-04 Database resources,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Databases,Cancer genomics,Splice variants,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ino de Bruijn<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Aditi Gopalan<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiang Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Hongxin Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Onur Sumer<sup>1<\/sup>, Thomas  Y.

Our research demonstrates how this process can be automated using GCP-native services.<br \/>Methods: We configured the Medical Image De-Identification (MIDI) pipeline to automate de-identification of cancer imaging data. De-identification is performed using an alpha release of GCP&#8217;s Healthcare API which was configured to scrub all Protected Health Information (PHI) from both Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) headers and burnt-in text in pixel data. A dataset containing 216 patients and 23,921 images was prepared to test the de-identification algorithm by placing synthetic PHI in both DICOM headers and pixel data. The synthetic data matched real data seen during curation at The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) and included data difficult for an algorithm to detect. Accuracy of the MIDI pipeline was measured against TCIA&#8217;s standard tools and procedures for de-identification. Measures included correct detection of all PHI data and correct action taken (e.g., remove, encrypt, or otherwise obscure). Throughput was also measured.<br \/>Results: Throughput was measured at 22.0 images per second over 10 runs. The MIDI pipeline&#8217;s accuracy for DICOM headers was 98.7%, accurately detecting dates, addresses, phone numbers, unique identifiers, names, and other common PHI. The most common PHI failed to remove were special cases that included uncommon names or names with symbols, dates in string data types that were mistaken for other IDs, patient IDs, and abbreviated institution names. Private Creator data elements were consistently failed to be retained. These errors were due to options not currently available, and algorithms not trained on specific PHI, such as abbreviated institution names. UIDs were correctly replaced. PHI burnt-in the pixel data was successfully detected and removed, with one false positive.<br \/>Conclusion: We demonstrate the current capability and performance of automated cancer image de-identification. Our results show that while full automation is within grasp, a semi-automated pipeline is now feasible. A human expert in the loop can be used for final verification. This will lead to a much-needed acceleration of image de-identification, to handle the rapidly growing volume of data and provide rapid timely access in support of cancer research. Future work will focus on including pre- and post-processing tools to aid the human expert in the loop, such as identifying and flagging questionable images for manual review. These tools will also be used to catch the errors mentioned in results.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-04 Database resources,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Databases,Imaging,Machine learning,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Benjamin  P.

It has become a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. However, the clinical outcome for advanced-stage patients with cancer metastasis after conventional treatment remains poor. Although cancer immunotherapy has attracted much attention for the treatment of these deadly cancers as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy, the objective response rate to this treatment remains low and most of the responsive patients only have a partial response. Accumulating evidence suggests that multiple mechanisms are involved in the resistance to cancer immunotherapy.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> To facilitate the identification of the cancer patients who most likely respond to immunotherapy, we developed a stand-alone open-source ImmuneMirror pipeline with graphical analysis results for evaluating the selected features including tumor mutation burden, microsatellite instability (MSI) status, HLA typing, predicted neoantigen load and the top-ranked neoantigens with T cell immunogenicity as well as the expression of innate anti-PD1 resistance (IPRES) gene signature. We incorporated a machine-learning model for neoantigen prediction and prioritization in ImmuneMirror and established a web server. The model was trained and tested using the known neopeptides with T cell immunogenicity collected from 19 published studies, and combined neoantigen-relevant features: agretopicity, foreignness, hydrophobicity, binding stability, peptide processing, and transportation scores.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: The accuracy of neoantigen prediction accuracy of ImmuneMirror model is 0.87. We utilized ImmuneMirror to analyze 805 normal-tumor paired samples in GIT cancers including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), colorectal cancer (CRC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Elevated neoantigen load was correlated with good clinical outcomes in ESCC. Interestingly, we identified a subgroup of MSI-H CRC with relatively low neoantigen loads for MHC Class I and Class II, respectively, though the tumor mutation burdens of this subset of patients were comparable with other MSI-H CRC. Our result suggests this subset of patients may not respond well to immunotherapy. In addition, the neopeptide YMCNSSCMG<u>V<\/u> derived from the TP53 hotpot mutation G245V mutation restricted by HLA-A02 was identified as the actional target in the ESCC patient by ImmuneMirror and confirmed by the experimental validation.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> These results showed the reliability and effectiveness of ImmuneMirror for evaluating the relevant features and predicting putative neoantigens.<br \/><b>Acknowledgments: <\/b>We acknowledge the support from Health Medical Research Fund (Grant No. 07182016) from the Research Fund Secretariat of Health Bureau in Hong Kong.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,Immunotherapy,Bioinformatics,Microsatellite instability,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Wei Dai<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Gulam Sarwar Chuwdhury<sup>1<\/sup>, Yunshan Guo<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhonghua Liu<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong,<sup>2<\/sup>Columbia University, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5cdbafa2-3403-4436-914b-0354f1682e7c","ControlNumber":"5681","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;W.

Because of the emerging CRISPR-cas9 technology, a number of cancer cells were screened in gene combination double knockout (CDKO) experiments. These CDKO experiments have been effective in identifying SL gene pairs as potential combination targets in treating cancer. The existing SL database, SynLethDB v2.0, attempted to integrate SL experiments and data, but has several knowledge gaps: (1) missing all non-SL gene pairs; (2) inaccurate cell line annotations; (3) incomprehensive coverage of CDKO experiments; (4) deviation from originally reported SL scores, and most importantly (5) ignoring the difference among various SL calculation methods, including sequence mapping, sequence count processing, sample normalization, background control normalization, and SL score calculation.<br \/>Methods: SL knowledge base (SLKB) is developed. It includes SL data from 11 published CDKO experiments in 22 cell lines. Between SLKB and SynLethDB, their cell line data and positive\/negative SL gene pair data collected from CDKO experiments were compared. Five SL calculation methods are compared: median SL score with and without background control normalization (Median-B\/NB), similarly sgRNA-Derived B\/NB, Horlbeck-Score, GEMINI, and MAGeCK-based SL score (MAGeCK-Score). We compared their overall overlapping and pairwise overlapping among top 10% SL gene pairs.<br \/>Results:<br \/>- For human SL, SynLethDB only included two CDKO experiments, 189 SL gene pairs, and 0 non-SL gene pairs. Our SLKB has 11 CDKO experiments, 22 cell lines, 16,044 SL gene pairs, and 264,444 non-SL gene pairs..<br \/>- Among top 10% SL gene pairs from five SL calculation methods, only 0.05% are overlapping.<br \/>- In pairwise overlapping analysis, Median-B\/NB Score has the highest averaging pairwise overlapping with the other four methods, 26.82%. GEMINI has the lowest average pairwise overlapping with the other methods, 5.11%. The averaging overlapping rates for MAGeCK-Score, sgRNA-Derived B\/NB Score, and Horlbeck-Score are 24.52%, 18.50%, and 9.89% respectively.<br \/>Conclusion: SLKB is a much more comprehensive SL database than SynLethDB in CDKO experiment data integration and includes original scorings. There is a significant amount of difference between five SL calculation methods and their SL scores. All five SL scores can be queried and ranked in SLKB.

Efficient collection, curation, and sharing of these data are expected to enable researchers to synthesize larger datasets and apply novel methods to discover new patterns for diagnosis, treatment, and care of disease. Consequently, data platforms that support these functionalities have become an important instrument for the biomedical research community. The National Cancer Institute&#8217;s (NCI&#8217;s) Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) is a data platform for the cancer research community that provides cloud-based, secure storage and analytic tools for cancer data, including genomics, proteomics, imaging, and clinical trial data. CRDC has been funded by multiple sources, including the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot program. Achieving long-term sustainability of the CRDC program is the focus of our study.<br \/>Methods: We applied a Financial Operations (FinOps) framework to map all costs to functionalities provided by the CRDC, including processes such as data intake, storage, compute, user support, and project management. We established a comprehensive financial baseline for the operations of the CRDC, identified opportunities for optimization across multiple dimensions (people, processes, technology), projected future costs based on trends for cancer data, and evaluated sustainability under defined funding scenarios.<br \/>Results: We identified 15 recommendations for optimization of the CRDC, including automation and centralization of core services (e.g., intake, curation, indexing), optimization of storage (e.g., compression, archiving), and harmonization of common services across the CRDC components (e.g., common architecture, governance). If implemented, we could demonstrate that these recommendations offer a path to long-term sustainability of the CRDC program under a variety of funding scenarios.<br \/>Conclusion: Data platforms such as the CRDC will see rapid increases in operational costs due to the growing data volumes and demand from researchers. Optimizing governance and operational frameworks will result in efficiency gains that can ensure long-term sustainability. Taking these steps will be critical to provide the necessary infrastructure to advance the field of data-driven biomedical research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-04 Database resources,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Databases,Bioinformatics,Machine learning,Systems biology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Juergen  A.

However, there was no such investigation for clarifying the mechanism of carcinogenic effects and epigenetic reprogramming of human oral, brain, and lung stem cells. In this study, we investigated the carcinogenic effects of ENDS aerosols, and the mechanism of epigenetic reprogramming using the Comparative Toxico-genomics Database (CTD), NIH Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET), the database of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), AACR Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) database, and other bioinformatics databases. We found from CTD analysis that the chemical gene interactions showed approximately 3% of genes highly expressed by propylene glycol and diacetyl from a total of 98 genes. The AACR GENIE database analysis showed EGFR, is associated with gliomas (191 clinical data, DFCI glioma cohort), found among 98 genes regulated by propylene glycol and diacetyl. The CTD analysis also exhibited the chemical gene interactions of highly expressed 9 common genes (with miR140 by propylene glycol, and formaldehyde from a total of 3983 genes; 5 common genes by propylene glycol, acetaldehyde, from a total of 275 genes; 1 common gene by propylene glycol, crotonaldehyde (2-butenal), from a total of 227 genes; 7 common genes by propylene glycol, acrolein from total 2185 genes; 18 common genes by propylene glycol, and nicotine from total 1244 genes; 11 common genes by propylene glycol, and arsenic from total 4983 genes; 9 common genes with HDAC4, CD86, miR21 by propylene glycol, and cadmium from total 5242 genes. The ENDs aerosols contain Polonium-210 and lead-210 (concentration; 13 &#177; 2 Bq\/kg), which have been reported as Group 1 human carcinogens and emit alpha particles. We found that alpha particles caused DNA lesions, and gene mutations in human oral, brain, and lung stem cells and resulted in long-term chromosomal instability in primary human T lymphocytes by analyzing recent works of literature. The epigenetic mechanisms of histone modifications and these potential carcinogens have been revealed by the database of NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium and our analysis discovered that Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1(MAPK1) is epigenetically reprogrammed with close interaction of teen genes. Therefore, it is important to find the actual epigenetic mechanism of transcriptional regulation by these potential carcinogens on oral, lung, and brain stem cells, and our current study revealed this important relationship.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-04 Database resources,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Databases,Epigenetics,Radiation,Stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Akilah Shepard<sup>1<\/sup>, Oneilia Yearde<sup>1<\/sup>, Juan Sanchez<sup>2<\/sup>, Ryan Amador<sup>2<\/sup>, Gabriel Xirinachs<sup>2<\/sup>, Erika Hernandez<sup>2<\/sup>, Elizabeth Corrales<sup>2<\/sup>, Swarnava Das<sup>3<\/sup>, Marco Ruiz<sup>4<\/sup>, Madhumita Das<sup>2<\/sup>, Rose  M.

Since its 2016 public release, OncoKB has grown to include annotation for &#62;5,770 alterations in ~700 cancer-associated genes. OncoKB data is integrated into the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics and used to annotate &#62;12,000 MSK patient sequencing reports annually, encompassing both solid tumor and hematological malignancies. Users in academic, commercial and hospital settings outside MSK can programmatically access OncoKB data via its web API with an OncoKB license, which is free for academic research. To date, users from ~ 1400 institutions across &#62;70 countries have licensed access to OncoKB annotations. The OncoKB Therapeutic (Tx) Levels of Evidence assign tumor-type specific clinical actionability to individual mutational events based on data supporting whether an alteration is predictive of response to matched targeted therapies. To date, OncoKB includes 44 Level 1 genes (included in the FDA drug label), 23 Level 2 genes (included in professional guidelines), 33 Level 3A genes (predictive of drug response in well-powered clinical studies), 27 Level 4 genes (predictive of drug response based on compelling biological evidence), and 11 R1\/R2 resistance genes. In 2022, several major content additions were made to OncoKB based on key shifts in the precision oncology landscape. For example, OncoKB included 2 new tumor-agnostic FDA drug approvals, dabrafenib + trametinib and selpercatinib for BRAF V600E and RET fusion-positive solid tumors respectively (Level 1), capturing 5 tumor-agnostic FDA drug approvals to date. OncoKB promoted ERBB2 oncogenic mutations and FGFR1 fusions to Level 1 following their inclusion as patient eligibility criteria in FDA drug labels for trastuzumab deruxtecan (NSCLC) and pemigatinib (myeloid\/lymphoid neoplasms) respectively. NCCN guidelines for uterine sarcoma and pancreatic cancer listed PARP-inhibition for BRCA-mutant disease, making them Level 2 in these indications. Lastly, previously considered undruggable targets, TP53 Y220C and KRAS G12D, were included in OncoKB based on compelling evidence demonstrating response to allele-targeting drugs, PC14586 and RMC-6263, respectively. In sum, 7 novel clinically actionable biomarkers (Levels 1-4) and 11 follow-on precision oncology therapies for existing leveled biomarkers were added to OncoKB in 2022. Current OncoKB efforts are focused on prioritized high-volume cancer gene curation for annotation of whole exome\/genome data, annotation of germline alterations and development of a clinical trials matching system. *FDA recognition of OncoKB is partial and limited to the information clearly marked on www.oncokb.org.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-04 Database resources,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Precision medicine,Predictive biomarkers,Databases,Cancer genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Sarah  P.

An unprecedented number of samples emerged, which enable elucidate valid genetic inferences and contribute to finding novel associations for various phenotypes including cancer. However, most of the genome data is from European-based ancestry, which leads to the disparity in study for relatively minor ethnic groups including Asian. Meanwhile, among public genomic database, TOPMed consortium consists of ~180k participants, over 60% of the 180k samples are of predominantly non-European ancestry, and Asian ancestry consisted of 8 % in total. In addition, 1000 Genomes Project(1KG) contains 2,504 individuals from 26 populations and has sequenced 698 samples in addition. These projects serve as a reference to impute missing variants to improve association power for Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) subsequently. We compared the imputation results using those reference panels.Korean Genome Project (Korea1K), including 1094 whole genomes are public datasets consisting of only Korean (East Asian) origin. On GRCh38, Korea1K variants consisting of 59,463,566 variants in total, 99.6% with MAF &#60;1% rare variant, only 35.7% of those rare variants passed from GATK Best Practice VQSR filter. With Korea1K data, we have downsampled the result into the exonic level, imputed with reference panels, and seen the consequences for which reference panel shows the best performances. Using 1KG as a reference, we could identify novel rare variants only in 0.1 to 0.38 fold of filtered rare variant in 1KG phase3 and 1KG phase3 30X respectively. On the other hand, TOPMed imputation resulted in rare variants over 1.65 fold increase. With well-imputed variants R<sup>2<\/sup> over 0.8, all three reference database showed poor conservation which only 0.009 % of rare variant are rescued. The reference panel we commonly use are large but required to have more diversity in a Asian rare variant perspective. Despite increase of the Asian fraction in the public genomic database, our result suggests that the number of reference Asian samples are still low to perform association study. In conclusion, our finding highlights both the utility and limitation of the imputation reference panel for Asian ancestry. Novel variants filled by imputation are promising for adding power to various association studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-04 Database resources,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Whole genome sequencing,Genome-wide association studies (GWAS),Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>GangPyo Ryu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Youngil Koh<sup>2<\/sup>, Sung-soo Yoon<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"64708642-4494-43dd-accd-4b94770ddf8b","ControlNumber":"7767","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>G.

We also developed the CCA45 gene-expression signature that could accurately predict the prognosis of CCA patients, especially those with Asian ethnic backgrounds. To further explore therapeutic candidates and potential resistance mechanisms, we have established CCA1 cell lines resistant to their subgroup-specific drug candidates: MEK and SRC inhibitors. Reverse-phase protein arrays (RPPA)-based proteomic profiling revealed upregulation of cell cycle, apoptosis, MAPK, and mTOR-related proteins in both MEKi- and SRCi-resistant cells. Src pathway activity was found to be more significantly reduced in SRCi-resistant cells. We identified CDK4\/6 inhibitors as the second-line therapeutic candidates for MEK inhibitor-resistant cells by systematic drug screening. SRCi-resistant cells unexpectedly developed cross-resistance to MEK inhibitors and showed sensitivity to only a few CDK4\/6 inhibitors. These data are beneficial for the clinical translation of our proposed drug candidates for Asian CCA, preparing the alternate regimens after drug resistance. We also adopted the DSP-based spatial transcriptomic platform to compare the tumor microenvironment between chemotherapy-sensitive and chemotherapy-resistant CCA patients. While the CTA panel showed consistent patterns of normalized gene expression to those of the WTA panel, the CTA panel can only measure 17 of the 45 genes required for our CCA45 signature. Out of these 17 genes, <i>ITGB4<\/i>, <i>FGFR3<\/i>, <i>VEGFC<\/i>, <i>NOTCH1<\/i>, and <i>RRAD <\/i>showed significant gene expression changes with reducing tumor percentage. The microenvironment of gemcitabine\/cisplatin responder (R) non-responder (NR) exhibited negative regulation of ERK1\/2 and MAPK, high WNT pathway activity, and high tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL). In contrast, the microenvironment of the non-responder (NR) subgroup showed high neutrophil-related activity, high NF&#954;B, high Treg, and the exhausted immune phenotype. Overall, our study contributes toward realizing the precision medicine concept for CCA patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-04 Database resources,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Systems biology,Personalized medicine,Cholangiocarcinoma,Drug-discovery screen,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Supawan Jamnongsong<sup>1<\/sup>, Patipark Kueanjinda<sup>2<\/sup>, Piyathida Tawornparcha<sup>1<\/sup>, Kulthida Vaeteewoottacharn<sup>3<\/sup>, Seiji Okada<sup>4<\/sup>, Siwanon Jirawatnotai<sup>1<\/sup>, Ananya Pongpaibul<sup>5<\/sup>, Krittiya Korphaisarn<sup>6<\/sup>, <b>Somponnat Sampattavanich<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand,<sup>4<\/sup>Division of Hematopoiesis, Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand,<sup>6<\/sup>Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"513c1a59-07d1-47d6-a2c2-baa6b6b03472","ControlNumber":"4738","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

To create community and training opportunities for a diverse body of undergraduate students (incl. online students) interested in cancer research, we developed a well-rounded e-mentoring program that incorporates alternated sessions of scientific mentoring (i.e., design a study, create a poster) and professional development (i.e., graduate school strategy and applications, networking). The theoretical background of our program derives from project and team-based learning, which state that students tend to learn better and be more engaged when working hands-on on a given project, in teams. Our teams are led by experienced undergraduate researchers, which enables them to gain leadership experience before applying to graduate school.<br \/>We implemented this e-mentoring program in a research center at a large southwestern public university, where 43 undergraduate research assistants were mentored via Zoom during the Spring of 2022. At the end of the semester, we administered a survey to assess program effectiveness and collect student feedback. 31 students took the survey, which revealed that during Spring 2022, 25% of students were responsible for the care of children or other family member(s), 47% worked part-time and 22% worked full-time, and 56% of students encountered personal and\/or professional challenges. Furthermore, we measured program effectiveness using the College Student Mentoring Scale, a comprehensive tool that measures students&#8217; perceived psychological and emotional support, degree and career support, academic knowledge support, and role modeling they received during their time in the program. Findings indicate that 82% of students felt they received psychological and emotional support and degree and career support while in the program. Moreover, 96.3% of students indicated that they felt they received academic knowledge support and benefited from role modeling while in the ACE Scholars Program. Additionally, 85% of students agreed or strongly agreed that the ACE Scholars Program, with its research experience and career and professional development components, has helped them be prepared for their future endeavors. Overall, 86% of the students indicated that they were extremely satisfied with the ACE Scholars Program. We will discuss the implications of this program and its findings for the practice of e-mentoring undergraduate students who are interested in cancer research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-13 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Systems biology,Bioinformatics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Cristina Baciu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Compton Zachary<sup><\/sup>, Carlo Maley<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Arizona State Univ.

Using two publicly available RNA-seq datasets (n=54 normal tissues; n=1504 cancer cell lines), we show that both healthy and cancerous cells occupy a trade-off between five canonical phenotypes: OxPhos, Warburg, Fibroblastic, Immune, and Growth. Each cell is assigned a phenotype score that, as we demonstrate, predicts differential drug sensitivities and mutational signatures, even among cancers of the same tissue type.

We developed an online AI platform that integrates machine learning algorithms in Computer Vision to quickly and automatically obtain accurate and comprehensive information on blood vessels and fibrosis regions from a whole pathology image.<br \/>Methods: In a stained pathology image, blood vessels are stained with a different color than other components (e. g. connective tissues, tumor cells, background), so we can directly locate pixels representing them. They also have different topological structures, so we can outline and count the contours of vessels. To count the number of vessels more precisely and reduce the interference of noise, we keep a contour only if it intersects with some located pixels and the number of pixels in the intersection exceeds an adjustable threshold. The fibrosis regions are identified by color contrast since they are stained with a distinct and easily recognizable color. The algorithms were implemented using the OpenCV package.<br \/>Results: Our AI platform automatically annotates blood vessels and fibrosis regions in pathology images, and generates reports in excel format to report the number and total area of blood vessels, the area and ratio of fibrosis regions, and execution time. It demonstrates superior performance to standard pathology software.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,pathology image,vascular,fibrosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yawen Zheng<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Likun Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Dawei Wang<sup><\/sup>, Sheng Gao<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Crown Bioscience Inc, Suzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"34ab2cb6-c63d-46cc-a310-bf47a0adbaef","ControlNumber":"4227","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.
