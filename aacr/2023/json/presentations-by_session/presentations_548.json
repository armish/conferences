While it has been appreciated that lung tumors rewire their cellular metabolic networks to support unrestrained proliferation, metabolic vulnerabilities have largely not been explored in the context of specific onco-genotypes. This represents a major gap in our understanding of how different oncogenic drivers in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) confer reliance on discrete metabolic networks to sustain tumor growth. The goals of this project are (1) to investigate metabolic dependencies in distinct molecular subtypes of lung cancer and (2) to elucidate how metabolic reprogramming drives resistance to targeted therapy. Using patient-derived cell culture models and tumor specimens collected from patients with ALK-positive (ALK+) NSCLC, we identified that lung tumors with ALK rearrangements harbor a unique metabolic signature marked by reliance on anabolic nucleotide pathways. A phosphoproteomic screen in ALK+ patient-derived cells identified a novel metabolic target of ALK signaling, GUK1, the only known enzyme responsible for GDP synthesis. We show that ALK binds to and phosphorylates GUK1 and that ALK-mediated GUK1 phosphorylation augments GDP\/GTP nucleotide biosynthesis. Steady-state and tracing metabolomic studies demonstrate that ALK inhibition and GUK1 phosphomutant are epistatic in guanine nucleotide production. Molecular dynamic modeling suggests that phosphorylation of GUK1 alters the dynamics of active site closure to enhance substrate processivity and protects GUK1 from a non-catalytic confirmation. Introduction of phosphomutant GUK1 into ALK+ patient-derived cell lines results in decreased tumor proliferation <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo <\/i>in xenograft models. Spatially resolved mass spectrometry imaging of tumor specimens from ALK+ patients demonstrates significant enrichment of guanine nucleotides in ALK+ and phospho-GUK1+ tumor cells. We identified that other oncogenic fusion proteins regulate GUK1 phosphorylation, highlighting the need to further characterize GUK1 as a metabolic liability in NSCLC. Furthermore, a subset of patient-derived cell lines with resistance to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) exhibits increased expression and phosphorylation of GUK1, indicating that regulation of this metabolic enzyme may play a role in mediating acquired resistance. We anticipate these studies will pave the way for the development of new therapeutic approaches by exploiting metabolic vulnerabilities in oncogene-driven lung cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Signaling,Resistance,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jaime Laurel Schneider<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kiran Kurmi<sup>2<\/sup>, Ishita Dhiman<sup>2<\/sup>, Roberta Colapietro<sup>2<\/sup>, Shakchhi Joshi<sup>2<\/sup>, Christian Johnson<sup>3<\/sup>, Satoshi Yoda<sup>4<\/sup>, Joao Paulo<sup>2<\/sup>, Daniela Ruiz<sup>5<\/sup>, Sylwia Stopka<sup>5<\/sup>, Gerard Baquer<sup>5<\/sup>, Jessica Lin<sup>1<\/sup>, Kevin Haigis<sup>3<\/sup>, Nathalie Agar<sup>5<\/sup>, Steven Gygi<sup>2<\/sup>, Aaron Hata<sup>1<\/sup>, Marcia Haigis<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>MGH\/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA,<sup>3<\/sup>Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA,<sup>4<\/sup>Tango Therapeutics, Boston, MA,<sup>5<\/sup>Brigham and Womens Hospital, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6ce1a31e-2647-4cf1-8153-9e49d89e205e","ControlNumber":"438","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

Recent work by our group and others have shown that FAO is critical for cell viability and survival, and is one of the key drivers of treatment resistance. Although FAO occurs in both the mitochondria and peroxisomes, the functional relevance and therapeutic exploitability of peroxisomal FAO (perFAO) in PCa has not been extensively explored compared to the mitochondria. Herein, we aim to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of targeting perFAO in clinical prostate tumors and PCa cells, and explore its role in PCa progression.<br \/>Methods and Results: Pharmacological inhibition of perFAO using the clinical agent, thioridazine, significantly suppressed proliferation, migration, and colony formation of a range of advanced and treatment-resistant PCa cells. Further, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of thioridazine in a more clinically relevant setting using patient-derived tissues and showed a significant inhibition of cell proliferation (n = 11, p &#60; 0.05). Next, we performed a bioinformatics analysis of clinical RNAseq datasets composed of primary and metastatic PCa tissues and identified DECR2, the auxiliary enzyme of perFAO, as a key target of perFAO in PCa. DECR2 is overexpressed in metastatic castrate-resistant PCa (CRPC) tissues compared to primary PCa and benign tissues, and is significantly associated with shorter relapse-free survival (p &#60; 0.01). DECR2 knockdown significantly suppressed proliferation and migration of CRPC and enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells, and markedly reduced LNCaP tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. In contrast, overexpression of DECR2 in LNCaP cells significantly increased tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. Interestingly, analysis of a published proteomics dataset of PCa cells that are either androgen-dependent or resistant to androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors revealed a significant correlation of peroxisomal genes (MSigDB) with acquired resistance to AR inhibition. Notably, DECR2 overexpression was significantly associated with shorter overall survival (p &#60; 0.05) in a metastatic CRPC cohort treated with AR inhibitors. We further showed that DECR2 overexpression in LNCaP cells significantly reduced sensitivity to AR inhibitor treatments and androgen-deprivation, suggesting a role for perFAO in promoting survival and treatment resistance.<br \/>Conclusion: Our study has revealed a novel role for perFAO in PCa progression and treatment resistance. Importantly, this study also identified DECR2 as a key regulator of tumor cell proliferation and lipid metabolism, representing a potential novel therapeutic target for advanced, treatment-resistant PCa that currently lacks effective targeted therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lipid metabolism,Cell cycle,Therapy resistance,Multiomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chui Yan Mah<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, An  D.

Despite of remarkable results against refractory B cell malignancies, intense effort is underway to augment the potency of CAR T cells in order to overcome the suppressive tumor microenvironment, which is associated with T cell exhaustion. Adenosine is a major mediator of immune suppression. Ectoenzyme CD39 plays a central role in the generation of adenosine by catalyzing the metabolism of ATP into ADP\/AMP. Then CD73 subsequently metabolizes ADP\/AMP into adenosine which mediates immune suppression through adenosine associated receptor signaling. CD39 is also expressed by exhausted CD8+ and tumor reactive T cells within the tumor microenvironment, where it is associated with tumor progression, but it remains unclear whether exhausted and\/or tumor reactive CD39+CD8+ T cells mediate immune suppression via the purigenic pathway.&nbsp;We developed a high affinity version of the disialoganglioside (GD2)-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (HA-GD2) that spontaneously clusters on the surface of human T cells in the absence of antigen and mimics chronic antigen exposure leading to T cell exhaustion. Using this model, we&nbsp;demonstrate that exhausted CD39+CD8+ CAR T cells actively produce adenosine and mediate immune suppression.&nbsp;In an attempt to generate adenosine resistance and enhance the function of exhausted CAR T cells, we knocked out CD39, CD73, or A2aR (adenosine A2a receptor) but observed only modest changes in phenotype and transcriptomics.&nbsp;In contrast, overexpression of transmembrane-bound adenosine deaminase, which metabolizes adenosine to inosine,&nbsp;induced&nbsp;higher frequency of stem- and central- like memory T cells, and a simultaneous decrease of exhausted T cell subpopulations. Direct exposure of HA-GD2 CAR T cells to high inosine concentration during cell manufacturing process, lead to a higher frequency of central-like memory cells&nbsp;and significant fitness enhancement associated with broad changes at the metabolic level. RNAseq and cyTOF analysis indicated decreased glycolytic flux, increased mitochondrial activity driven by glutamine and polyamine metabolism. Further, inosine altered the epigenetic state of HA-GD2 CAR T cells. We observed significant enrichment of IRF and NF-&#954;B transcription factor motifs and motifs associated with memory differentiation in T cells grown in the presence of inosine. Finally, we showed that production of exhausted HA-GD2 and clinical GD2 CAR T cells in inosine-containing culture media enhances their in vivo efficacy, leading to improved survival in GD2+ tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, we propose introducing inosine during GMP cell manufacturing as a novel strategy to improve CAR T function and subsequent clinical outcomes of CAR T cell therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Immunosuppression,Metabolism,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dorota Klysz<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Katie Freitas<sup>2<\/sup>, Meena Malipatlolla<sup>1<\/sup>, Stefanie Maier<sup>3<\/sup>, Carley Fowler<sup>1<\/sup>, Louai Labanieh<sup>1<\/sup>, Lucille Stuani<sup>4<\/sup>, Bence Daniel<sup>5<\/sup>, Katalin Sandor<sup>5<\/sup>, Peng Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Jing Huang<sup>1<\/sup>, Amaury Leruste<sup>1<\/sup>, Vimal Keerthi<sup>1<\/sup>, Nikolaos Gkitsas<sup>1<\/sup>, Shabnum Patel<sup>1<\/sup>, Justin Arredondo-Guerrero<sup>1<\/sup>, Chris Fisher<sup>1<\/sup>, Kyle Asano<sup>1<\/sup>, Sunny Patel<sup>1<\/sup>, Ansuman Satpathy<sup>5<\/sup>, Kara Davis<sup>6<\/sup>, Elena Sotillo<sup>1<\/sup>, Steven Feldman<sup>1<\/sup>, Crystal Mackall<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Center for Cancer Cell Therapy, Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Immunology Graduate Program, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA,<sup>3<\/sup>Stanford Cancer Institute, Palo Alto, CA,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA,<sup>6<\/sup>Department of Pediatrics, Center for Cancer Cell Therapy, Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"03b80301-4b07-402d-9bb4-8a95784834c1","ControlNumber":"2115","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

PHGDH is thought to be required for the proliferation of melanoma cells having chromosome 1p12 amplification. However, the role of PHGDH in chromosome 1p12 non-amplified melanoma is poorly understood. We observed that PHGDH is overexpressed in melanoma cell lines that do not harbor chromosome 1p12 amplification compared to melanocytes. Additionally, PHGDH is upregulated in melanomas compared to nevi. Hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway through activating mutations in BRAF or NRAS occurs in nearly all melanomas. Since PHGDH is universally upregulated in melanoma cells, we hypothesized that oncogenic BRAF mutations upregulate PHGDH expression, thereby generating a metabolic vulnerability in melanoma. Pharmacologic inactivation of the MAPK pathway using inhibitors of mutant BRAF\/MEK\/ERK resulted in the downregulation of PHGDH expression both in vitro and in xenograft tumors in vivo. On the other hand, acute expression of oncogenic BRAF (BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup>) in melanocytes resulted in upregulation of PHGDH expression. Downregulation of PHGDH in 1p12 non-amplified melanoma cell lines decreased their cell proliferation and colony formation ability in vitro. We also observed that genetic knockdown of PHGDH in a Braf<sup>V600E\/WT; <\/sup>Pten<sup>-\/- <\/sup>(BPP)<sup> <\/sup>melanoma mouse model significantly increased survival. In addition to de-novo synthesis, serine can be taken up from extracellular compartments. Depletion of extracellular serine from the media resulted in upregulation of PHGDH expression and reduced proliferation of melanoma cells in vitro. By contrast, serine-glycine starvation in BPP mice did not affect tumor development or survival. These results implicate the dependency of melanoma tumors on de-novo serine synthesis through PHGDH. To investigate the therapeutic applicability of the PHGDH dependency, we inhibited the MAPK pathway with BRAF inhibitor along with extracellular serine-glycine depletion. We hypothesized that inhibiting the BRAF-mediated PHGDH expression along with extracellular serine-glycine starvation effectively depletes serine specifically in melanoma cells. Notably, cell viability was significantly reduced in vitro when BRAF inhibition was combined with serine-glycine depletion. Furthermore, our preliminary studies suggests that serine-glycine depletion potentiates the effect of mutant BRAF inhibition on melanoma growth in BPP mouse models. Overall, these results suggest the importance of PHGDH for melanoma cell proliferation and tumor growth irrespective of its amplification status. Combined MAPK inhibition and serine starvation may therefore exploit a metabolic vulnerability of melanoma cells and could be explored for melanoma therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-04 Signaling pathways that regulate metabolism,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,Serine Metabolism,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Neel Jasani<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Benjamin Posorske<sup><\/sup>, Florian Karreth<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8bb85fea-c92a-400e-83b2-1a12a0cd43b2","ControlNumber":"5279","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

Machine learning has become a popular tool to study cancer biology and can identify complex patterns in the data which may not be decipherable by traditional analyses. We propose an approach to combine <sup>13<\/sup>C-tracer analysis with machine learning to quantify the metabolism of purines in glioblastoma patients. In recent years, multiple studies have been conducted on isotope tracing in cancer patients. While the data for the enrichment of metabolites in human tumors has improved our understanding of cancer metabolism, we lack methods to estimate metabolic fluxes from these enrichment values. A significant challenge in estimating the fluxes in human subjects is that we are limited to enrichment data from a single in-vivo measurement at isotopic non-steady state. We overcome this challenge by combining INST-MFA (Isotopic Non-Stationary-Metabolic Flux Analysis) with machine learning methods. We use the enrichment of circulating metabolites as an input and simulate the time-dependent metabolite enrichment profiles for randomized flux vectors. We use this data to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to predict the flux ratios. Apart from being able to predict the fluxes from a single time-point, a machine learning model drastically reduces the time required to fit a traditional INST-MFA model. We demonstrate the real-world validity of the model by predicting flux ratios in mice models and comparing them to results from traditional INST-MFA models. We apply the model to decipher the heterogeneity of the purine pathway in eight patients with brain tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,Metabolic Flux Analysis,Systems Biology,Glioblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anjali Mittal<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Andrew Scott<sup><\/sup>, Abhinav Achreja<sup><\/sup>, Vijay Tarnal<sup><\/sup>, Wajd Al-Holou<sup><\/sup>, Costas Lyssiotis<sup><\/sup>, Daniel Wahl<sup><\/sup>, Deepak Nagrath<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7894eb5d-145b-4d8d-863e-9235a4b17d86","ControlNumber":"3034","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

However, the relative roles of glycolysis and respiratory metabolism in supporting <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor growth and processes such as tumor dissemination and metastatic growth remain poorly understood, particularly on a systems level. Using a CRISPRi mini-library enriched for mitochondrial ribosomal protein and respiratory chain genes in multiple human lung cancer cell lines we analyzed <i>in vivo <\/i>metabolic requirements in xenograft tumors grown in distinct anatomic contexts. While knockdown of mitochondrial ribosomal protein and respiratory chain genes (mito-respiratory genes) has little impact on growth <i>in vitro<\/i>, tumor cells depend heavily on these genes when grown <i>in vivo<\/i> as either flank or primary orthotopic lung tumor xenografts. In contrast, respiratory function is comparatively dispensable for metastatic tumor growth. RNA-Seq and metabolomics analysis of tumor cells expressing individual sgRNAs against mito-respiratory genes indicate overexpression of glycolytic genes and increased sensitivity of glycolytic inhibition compared to control when grown <i>in vitro,<\/i> but when grown <i>in vivo<\/i> as primary tumors these cells downregulate glycolytic mechanisms. Metabolic shifts associated with silencing mito-respiratory genes can be detected <i>in vivo<\/i> with metabolic imaging. These studies demonstrate that discrete perturbations of mitochondrial respiratory chain function impact <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor growth in a context-specific manner with differential impacts on primary and metastatic tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Screening,Metabolism,Mitochondria,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Neal K.

However, hepatic ketogenesis is suppressed in IL-6 producing cancers, which prevents the utilization of this nutrient source as energy for the organism. In two IL-6 associated murine models of cancer cachexia we describe delayed tumor growth but accelerated onset of cancer cachexia and shortened survival when mice are fed KD. Mechanistically, we find this uncoupling is a consequence of the biochemical interaction of two simultaneously occurring NADPH-dependent pathways. Within the tumor, increased production of lipid peroxidation products (LPPs) and, consequently, saturation of the glutathione (GSH) system leads to ferroptotic death of cancer cells. Systemically, redox imbalance and NADPH depletion impairs the biosynthesis of corticosterone, the main regulator of metabolic stress, in the adrenal glands. Administration of dexamethasone, a potent glucocorticoid, improves food intake, normalizes glucose homeostasis and utilization of nutritional substrates, delays onset of cancer cachexia and extends survival of tumor-bearing mice fed KD, while preserving reduced tumor growth. Our study highlights that the outcome of systemic interventions cannot necessarily be extrapolated from the effect on the tumor alone, but that they have to be investigated for anti-cancer and host effects. These findings may be relevant to clinical research efforts that investigate nutritional interventions such as KD in patients with cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++EN01-05 Hormone synthesis, metabolism, and inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cachexia,Diet,Redox,Colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Miriam Ferrer<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nicholas Mourikis<sup>1<\/sup>, Emma  E.
