We report results of FIGHT-207, an open-label, single-arm phase 2 study of pemigatinib, a potent, selective FGFR1-3 inhibitor, in patients with previously treated unresectable or metastatic <i>FGFR<\/i>-altered solid tumors (NCT03822117).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Patients were assigned to cohorts A (<i>FGFR1-3<\/i> fusions), B (<i>FGFR1-3<\/i> activating non-kinase domain mutations), and C (<i>FGFR1-3 <\/i>kinase domain mutations and alterations of unknown significance) and received continuous 13.5 mg pemigatinib once daily. Prior FGFR inhibitor treatment was prohibited. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 or RANO as confirmed by independent central review.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> 107 patients were enrolled and assigned to cohorts A (n=49), B (n=32), and C (n=26). ORR in cohorts A, B, and C was 26.5%, 9.4%, and 3.8%, respectively. Responses were observed for multiple tumor types, including gliomas and gynecologic and pancreatic tumors (<b>Table<\/b>). Notably, we saw responses for several infrequent <i>FGFR<\/i> alterations, including an <i>FGFR1<\/i> kinase domain mutation (K656E) and an <i>FGFR2 <\/i>extracellular in-frame deletion (<i>FGFR2<\/i> I291_Y308Del). Among patients in cohorts A+B with centrally confirmed <i>FGFR<\/i> alterations, <i>BAP1 <\/i>co-alterations were observed in 47% (7\/15) of responders, and <i>TP53 <\/i>co-alterations were<i> <\/i>present in 43% (23\/53) of nonresponders. Safety was consistent with prior reports.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> In addition to cholangiocarcinoma, pemigatinib showed clinical activity in gliomas, gynecologic tumors, and pancreatic cancer and safety was consistent with prior reports. We observed responses in patients with previously unreported <i>FGFR <\/i>alterations, suggesting that a broader population of patients may benefit from FGFR inhibitors. Further correlative work to predict response to therapy is needed to better identify these patients.<br \/><b>Table.

Alpelisib, an orthosteric inhibitor, validated mutant-PI3K&#945; as a therapeutic target; however, toxicity from non-selective inhibition of WT PI3K&#945; (hyperglycemia) and other PI3K isoforms limits its clinical activity. RLY-2608, a novel oral allosteric PI3K&#945; inhibitor, is designed to overcome these limitations via mutant- and isoform-selective PI3K&#945; inhibition. We initiated a first-in-human study (NCT05216432) to define the MTD, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and anti-tumor activity of RLY-2608 in <i>PIK3CA-<\/i>mutant solid tumor patients (pts) and of RLY-2608 plus fulvestrant (combo) in pts with <i>PIK3CA-<\/i>mutant, HR+HER2-BC, who had received prior CDK4\/6 inhibitor and endocrine therapy.<br \/><b>METHODS<\/b>: Adult pts with no prior PI3Ki\/mTORi therapy received RLY-2608 QD or BID on a 4-week (wk) cycle following a Bayesian Optimal Interval dose escalation. Eligible BC pts received fulvestrant. PK, pharmacodynamics (ex vivo pAKT inhibition; tumor markers; ctDNAs), treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and anti-tumor activity per RECIST 1.1 were assessed.<br \/><b>RESULTS<\/b>: As of 31Jan23, 40 pts (21 BC combo pts) with <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutations (12 kinase, 18 helical, 10 other) received RLY-2608 at doses of 100-1600 mg\/day. Median number of prior treatments was 4 (1-11). An MTD has not been reached and dose escalation continues. RLY-2608 PK were favorable with BID dosing providing low steady-state peak-to-trough variability for mutant-selective inhibition. This enabled dose-dependent increase in exposure and target inhibition with doses &#8805;600 mg BID and pAKT suppression (&#8805;80%) in the expected therapeutic range with minimal\/no impact on glucose homeostasis. Across arms, safety was consistent: most frequent TEAEs (&#62;15%) were low grade (&#8804;Gr 2) nausea (30%), fatigue (22.5%), headache (22.5%), hypokalemia (22.5%), and diarrhea (17.5%). No DLTs were observed, and no pts discontinued due to related AEs. Initial anti-tumor activity was observed in BC combo pts including declines in tumor markers, <i>PIK3CA<\/i>\/<i>ESR1<\/i> ctDNAs and radiographic tumor reduction in 7 of 10 RECIST measurable pts. At 600 mg BID, 6\/6 BC combo pts had disease stabilization and remain on treatment, including all RECIST-measurable pts with tumor reduction. Overall, 17 (81%) BC combo pts remain on treatment with median duration of 12 (1-40) wks.<br \/><b>CONCLUSION<\/b>: Across <i>PIK3CA<\/i> genotypes, RLY-2608 demonstrated target inhibition and anti-tumor activity with minimal impact on glucose homeostasis. These proof-of-mechanism data indicate that RLY-2608 is the first allosteric, pan-mutant selective PI3K&#945; inhibitor and that RLY-2608 has broad therapeutic potential in <i>PIK3CA<\/i>-driven cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PL02-01 Placeholder Abstracts: Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PIK3CA,Breast cancer,FIH,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Andreas Varkaris<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Komal Jhaveri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Cesar A.

A genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen identified DDR alterations that sensitize tumors to the ATRi camonsertib (cam) plus PARPi. Based on preclinical models, tolerability and efficacy of cam plus PARPi given intermittently at low doses in pts with solid tumors with DDR alterations, including BRCA-mutated PARPi-resistant cancers, was evaluated.<br \/>Methods: Pts (&#8805; 18 yrs) with relapsed\/refractory (r\/r) solid tumors with DDR alterations were treated with cam plus talazoparib (tala), niraparib (nira), or olaparib (ola) in 2 phase I trials (NCT04497116, NCT04972110). An adaptive BOIN design was used to optimize dose\/schedule. Endpoints were safety, recommended phase II dose (RP2D), pharmacokinetics (PK), response (RECIST v1.1 [confirmed\/unconfirmed], CA 125, or PSA), clinical benefit rate (CBR; RECIST\/tumor marker response or treatment duration &#8805; 16 wk), and ctDNA molecular response rate (MRR; best reduction in mean variant allele frequency [mVAF] &#8805; 50%).<br \/>Results: As of Nov 2022, 99 pts were enrolled (61 with &#8805; 3 prior lines of therapy, 36 PARPi-pretreated); 43, 27, 29 pts in tala, nira, and ola combinations, respectively. Tumors included ovarian (n=20), prostate (n=13), breast (n=17), bile duct (n=3); most common genotypes were <i>ATM<\/i> (n=26), <i>BRCA1<\/i> (n=19), and <i>BRCA2<\/i> (n=33). Grade 3+ toxicities included reversible myelosuppression (neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia in 35%, 28%, and 14% of pts overall; 33%, 16%, and 11% at preliminary RP2Ds), fatigue (3%), and alkaline phosphatase increase (2%). Two pts discontinued treatment due to drug-related toxicity. Forty pts remain on therapy, up to 63 wks. Preliminary RP2Ds: cam 80 mg QD (d 5-7) + tala 0.25 mg QD, 1 wk on\/1 wk off; cam 80 mg QD + nira 100 mg QD, 2 d on\/5 d off; cam 50 mg QD + ola 100 mg BID, 3 d on\/4 d off. As of abstract submission, response rate was 13% in 85 evaluable pts; CBR was 49%. Responders included pts with ovarian (n=6), bile duct (n=2), and breast, pancreatic, and carcinoma of unknown primary (n=1 each) cancers harboring alterations in <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> (n=9), <i>IDH1<\/i> (n=1), and <i>ATM<\/i> (n=1). Of 30 evaluable PARPi-pretreated pts, response rate was 23% and CBR was 52%. MRR was 64% (14\/22 evaluable); change in mVAF correlated with a change in target lesion size (r=0.63, P=0.001). PK of each drug in the combination was consistent with respective monotherapy PK.<br \/>Conclusion: Combination of cam plus PARPi at low doses on intermittent schedules was generally well-tolerated with clinical activity in DDR-aberrant tumors, including those pretreated with PARPi. RP2D optimization and translational correlative studies are ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ATR,DNA damage response,PARP inhibitors,Synthetic lethality,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Timothy A.

Arm N explores the PARP inhibitor (PARPi) olaparib (ola) in combination with the Ataxia telangiectasia mutated rad3 related (ATR) inhibitor (ATRi) ceralasertib (cer). In pediatric cancer, the rationale for this combination is twofold: i) Many cancers show evidence of a constitutively active ATR pathway due to endogenous replication\/transcription stress (RS) which can be targeted by ATRi. PARPi in this setting serves as additional replication stressor\/ATRi sensitizer. ii) Classical BRCA alterations are rare and alterations conferring homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) likely require a combination approach including PARPi. This is a first-in-child study and we here report the results of the Phase I dose escalation part.<br \/>Methods: Children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory cancer and advanced molecular profiling at relapse were eligible. All patients had to have molecular alterations consistent with HRD or RS in their tumor. Ola was administered orally twice daily (BID) continuously and cer orally BID on days 1-14 of a 28-day cycle. Dose level (DL) 1 was ola 150\/100\/50 mg BID and cer 80\/40\/30 mg BID in age group 12-18\/6-&#60;12\/3-&#60;6 years, respectively. Dose-escalation followed a Boin design, 12 patients treated at the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) were required to conclude the Phase I part. Plasma for pharmacokinetics (PK) of both drugs was collected during Cycle 1.<br \/>Results: Eighteen patients (8 sarcomas, 5 central nervous system tumors, 4 neuroblastomas, 1 carcinoma) with a median age of 16 years (range, 4;24) were enrolled over 3 dose levels between Feb 2021 and Sep 2022 and received a median of 3.5 cycles (range 1-12+; data cut-off Jan 2023). The combination was well tolerated overall, toxicity was mainly hematologic (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia) and gastrointestinal (nausea\/ vomiting). Five patients encountered dose-limiting toxicities (thrombocytopenia grade 3\/4 requiring platelet transfusions &#62; 7 days in all, and grade 4 neutropenia for &#62; 7 days or with documented infection in 1 patient each; 0\/3 DL-1, 2\/12 in DL1 and 3\/3 in DL2), suggesting DL1 as RP2D. One confirmed partial response (PR) was observed in a patient with pinealoblastoma (<i>FANCA<\/i> VUS), a prolonged stable disease converted to a PR after cycle 9 in a neuroblastoma (11q loss, <i>ATRX<\/i> VUS, in cycle 10). Four patients are ongoing in cycle 5\/6\/10\/12, respectively. PK and retrospective biomarker analysis are ongoing to identify factors associated with clinical benefit and data will be presented.<br \/>Conclusions: Ola and cer in combination are well tolerated. Recruitment in two expansion cohorts (HRD and RS) is ongoing at the RP2D, including confirmation of RP2D in younger children.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT09-01 Phase I, II, or III clinical trials in pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ATR,PARP,Pediatric cancers,Phase I,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Susanne A.
