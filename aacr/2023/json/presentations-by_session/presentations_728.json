[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> Treatment options for patients with recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) are limited. The lack of effectiveness from oral multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors, like sunitinib, might be due to a restricted blood-brain barrier penetration. We previously found that standard daily dosed sunitinib resulted in relatively low tumor drug concentrations in patients with GBM (PMID: 35165100). Based on these results, we here tested whether an alternatively scheduled, high-dose intermittent sunitinib treatment strategy with the aim to increase tumor drug concentrations, would improve the outcome of patients with rGBM compared to standard therapy with lomustine. Preliminary efficacy and safety results of the trial are presented.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The STELLAR-trial is a randomized multicenter phase II\/III clinical study for patients with rGBM (NCT03025893). Patients were randomized 1:1 to high-dose intermittent sunitinib (300mg once every week (Q1W) in part 1 or 700mg once every two weeks (Q2W) in part 2) or to standard therapy with lomustine (110mg\/m2 once every 6 weeks). Adult patients with de novo or secondary glioblastoma with first recurrence after a maximum of one line of chemotherapy and &#8805; 3 months since completion of radiotherapy were eligible. The primary endpoint of the trial was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), six-month progression-free survival (PFS6) and tolerability of the treatment. A pre-planned interim analysis for futility was performed after inclusion of 25% of patients in both part 1 and part 2. <b>Results:<\/b> At the pre-planned interim analysis, after inclusion of 26 and 29 patients in part 1 and 2, respectively, the trial was terminated for futility. The median PFS (mPFS) for sunitinib 300mg Q1W was 1.5 months (95% CI 1.4 - 1.7) as compared to 1.5 months (95% CI 1.4 - 1.6) for lomustine (HR 1.24, 95% CI 0.55 - 2.79; p=0.60). For sunitinib dosed at 700mg Q2W, the mPFS was 1.4 months (95% CI 1.3 - 1.5) as compared to 1.5 months (95% CI 1.3 - 1.7) for lomustine (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.44 - 2.10; p=0.92). The median OS (mOS) for sunitinib 300 mg Q1W was 6.5 months (95% CI 4.5 - 8.5) compared to 4.7 (95% CI 3.3 - 6.0) for lomustine (log rank p=0.83). For sunitinib 700mg Q2W the mOS was 4.7 months (95% CI 3.8 - 5.6) compared to 6.8 months (95% CI 1.7 - 12.0) for lomustine (log rank p=0.65). The percentage of patients that were progression free at 6 months was 8% for both sunitinib groups and 15% for the lomustine group. In general, both treatment strategies with either high-dose intermittent sunitinib or lomustine were tolerated well with maximal grade 3 toxicities in respectively 8% and 15% of patients.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Alternative high-dose intermittent sunitinib treatment failed to improve the outcome of patients with rGBM when compared to standard lomustine therapy. Since lomustine remains a poor treatment strategy in rGBM, novel, more effective therapies are urgently needed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Sunitinib,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Blood-brain barrier,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jorien B.

Here we report the updates of the final results and biomarker associates of the study.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Premenopausal ER+\/HER2- MBC patients who failed no more than 2 lines of hormone therapy without chemotherapy for MBC were enrolled in a tertiary medical center in Taiwan (NCT02990845). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 8 months. The secondary endpoints included overall response rate, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and other biomarkers. Pre-treatment (N=12) and post-treatment (N=5) tumor tissue were collected for biomarker analysis, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte(TIL), PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemical staining, tumor mutational burden, RNAseq, and IO360 analysis.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> A total of 15 patients were enrolled in the study with 14 evaluable patients. The progression-free survival rate at 8 months was 64.3%. The median PFS and OS were 10.34 months and 39.56 months respectively. The overall response was 35.7%. TIL, tumor mutational burden, or PD-L1 expression were not associated with the response to the treatment. In the NanoString IO-360 analysis, increased expression of genes in the immune related signature was noted in the post-treatment samples as compared to the pre-treatment samples. The expression levels of MHC class II and T cell-related genes were upregulated in the post-treatment samples. Most of the immune cell populations are increased after pembrolizumab\/ exemestane\/ leuprolide treatment. CD56 dim NK cells, Th1 cells, and NK cells are the top 3 populations that are increased after treatment. Using CIBERSORT algorithms to analyze RNAseq data from pretreatment samples, dendritic cells (p=0.039) and NK cells (p=0.082) were associated with the responders versus non-responders in the study.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> In this final analysis, pembrolizumab, exemestane, and leuprolide remain an effective treatment for premenopausal ER+\/HER2- MBC.

PARPi activate the cGAS-STING pathway leading to increased PD-L1 expression and cytotoxic T-cell recruitment, creating a tumor microenvironment (TME) that may be more vulnerable to immunotherapy. This study was conducted to evaluate the safety, efficacy and effects on the TME of the PARPi tala combined with the PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab in ABC, and to assess the impact of <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> status on clinical outcomes.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> TALAVE was an open-label, multi-institutional trial (NCT03964532) for pts with HER2-negative ABC. Pts were enrolled in two cohorts: cohort 1 - <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i>m and HER2-negative ABC; cohort 2 - <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> wildtype TNBC. Pts received a 4-week induction of tala (1mg po daily D1-D28), followed by a combination of daily tala and avelumab (800mg IV D1, D15). The primary objective was the safety and tolerability of the combination. Secondary objectives included ORR, OS and PFS. Pts underwent serial biopsies to investigate molecular signatures associated with BRCA status or clinical benefit using multiple omics techniques: RNA profiling by NanoString PanCancer IO 360&#8482; Panel, GeoMx&#174; Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) Whole Transcriptome Atlas (WTA) and protein spatial analysis by multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) and Cyclic Immunofluorescence (CyCIF).<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> 12 pts were enrolled in each cohort.

The median age was 50 [IQR:43-59.5]; all pts were female, with median of 1 prior therapy for ABC [IQR: 0-2.5]. 42% pts had prior platinum. ORR was 42% (83% in cohort 1; 0% in cohort 2). There were 10 PRs, all in cohort 1. mPFS was 5.1 months (mo) (95% CI: 3.7-7.3 mo); 9.3mo in cohort 1 and 2.9mo in cohort 2. 5 out of 24 pts remain on treatment, all in cohort 1. Treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) included anemia 33%, neutropenia 25% (gr3+ 13%), thrombocytopenia 21% (gr3+ 13%), fatigue 33% and nausea 29%. Other TRAEs gr3+ included dyspnea (4%) and AST elevation (4%). There were no gr5 events. RNA analysis showed that in cohort 1, tala monotherapy disrupted MMEJ, induced antiproliferative effects and expression of genes in the cGAS-STING pathway, including TBK1-mediated IRF3 activation, with downstream induction of T-cell, dendritic cell and cytokine gene expression.

Among those with a normal immunologic response (n=13, 56%), disease outcomes included 4 SD and 2 PR (46% CBR) vs anergic patients (n=7, 30%) with 1 SD (14% CBR); 3 patients (13%) with unknown anergy testing had 0% CBR. All 7 anergic patients developed delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) injection site responses to SV-BR-1-GM. Subjects with DTH (injection site induration\/erythema) had a significant reduction in the risk of progression or death (HR=0.096, 95%CI:0.02-0.50, p&#60;0.05). Subjects with a reduction in circulating tumor cells (CTC) also had an improvement in PFS (HR 0.08, p=.0012). Median OS (uncensored) was 11.2 months in CO (n = 8). 7 out of 20 (35%) for SV and 9 out of 22 subjects (41%) for CO with available data, exceeded prior PFS. Among HLA matched subjects 4\/7 (57%) and 6\/9 (67%), respectively, had an increase in PFS. PFS ratio improved independent of prior number of lines, HER2 or HR status. The greatest improvement in PFS on a SV-BR-1-GM was in a HLA matched subject (&#62;6mo). TEAEs occurred in 20\/24 (83%) of subjects in CO including 9\/24 (38%) with injection site AEs. There were no AEs of special interest eg cytokine storm. There were no Grade 5 and only 6 grade 4 AEs in CO.<br \/>Conclusions: In an ongoing randomized phase 2, anergic patients had worse outcomes. SV-BR-1-GM was able to illicit an immune response regardless. Responses, stable disease and CBR were seen and associated with immune responses including injection site erythema\/induration (DTH), CTC changes and tumor grade I\/II. Patients with disease control had better quality of life. SV-BR-1-GM may be able to alter an anergic immune system for clinical benefit. Future pivotal trials will be based upon the ongoing confirmatory randomized clinical trial.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Immunotherapy,Allogenic whole cell therapy,SV-BR-1-GM,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Saranya Chumsri<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Minal Barve<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chaitali Nangia<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bonnie L.

High AR relative to ER is associated with endocrine resistance. This randomized phase II trial of neoadjuvant fulvestrant (F) with or without the anti-androgen enzalutamide (E) was designed to determine if the addition of E to F in women with <u>&#62;<\/u>T2 ER+\/Her2- primary BC would increase the % patients (pts) with limited residual disease at time of surgery as measured by modified preoperative endocrine predictive index (PEPI).<br \/>Methods: 4 months of therapy was given prior to surgery (F 500 mg IM weeks 1, 3, 5, 9, and 13) and pts were randomized to receive E 160 mg po daily for 16 weeks, stratified by node status and T-stage. Tumor biopsies were required at study entry and after 4 weeks on therapy (Wk5). PEPI score at time of surgery was the primary endpoint for efficacy. The minimax two-stage design had 80% power with type I error rate of 0.08. Reverse phase phosphoprotein array (RPPA), IHC for ER\/PR\/AR\/GR\/Ki67, and Polaris multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) panel for myeloid lineage immune cells were performed. Average signal levels were compared across arms, PEPI score (0, &#62;0), PEPI by arm, and Ki67 (&#60;10%, &#8805;10%). Comparisons at both baseline and with treatment were considered. Significance was assessed with empirical Bayes moderated t-statistics. Since exploratory, p-values were not adjusted for multiple testing.<br \/>Results: 69 pts consented; 59 evaluable. 95% completed surgery. PEPI=0 observed in 10 (17%). Of 33 pts on FE arm, 21 had T3\/T4 tumors, 91% ER+\/PR+, median AR expression 80%, Ki67 15%. Of 26 patients on F arm, 19% had T3\/T4 tumors, 96% ER+\/PR+, median AR expression 85%, Ki67 10%. PEPI=0 was achieved more frequently on the FE arm (8, 24%) than the F arm (2, 8%) (p=0.16). Toxicity was as expected with endocrine therapy. IHC of baseline vs Wk5 biopsies showed decreased ER, PR, and Ki67 levels by Wk5 that remained decreased at time of surgery. AR and GR were significantly decreased only in the FE arm at the time of surgery. RPPA revealed that baseline EGFR (Y1604 and Y992) was higher in tumors with PEPI=0 tumors, whereas the average baseline mTOR activation was higher among pts with PEPI&#62;0. Significant changes detected by RPPA upon treatment included a significant decrease in AR. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) were significantly reduced by treatment only in the FE arm.<br \/>Conclusions: The<b> <\/b>combination FE had manageable side effects. PEPI=0 was achieved more frequently on the FE arm (8\/33) than the F arm (2\/26). Activated EGFR was higher pretreatment in tumors achieving PEPI=0. mTOR pathway was elevated pretreatment in PEPI&#62;0 tumors (also observed with resistance to FE in ER+\/HER2- metastatic disease (SABCS 2021). When comparing pretreatment tumor to Wk5, total AR by RPPA was the most differentially decreased protein in PEPI=0 tumors. AR signaling is known to support immunosuppressive cells and we observed a marked decrease in MDSCs with treatment only on the FE arm.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Estrogen receptor,Androgen receptor,mTOR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Anthony D.

Their mechanism of action leads to high mutational burden and increased neoantigens suggesting tumors exposed to PARPi may have increased response to immunotherapy. Preclinical and phase I\/II trials have shown evidence of antitumor effect of PARPi + PD-L1 inhibition. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of the PARPi olaparib as monotherapy vs. in combination with PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab in patients with BRCAmt advanced breast cancer.<br \/>Methods: A multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase II study was conducted. Patients were enrolled at 20 sites in the US. Patients were allowed prior hormone or chemotherapy and randomized to receive olaparib 300 mg twice daily (O) +\/- atezolizumab 1200 mg IV every 21 days (O+A) until disease progression or intolerable side effect. Patients with progression on O were allowed to crossover to O+A arm. The primary endpoint was comparison of progression free survival (PFS) between arms. Overall survival (OS) was also assessed. Safety and activity analyses were done in patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. Serial tumor biopsies were collected at baseline, 6 weeks, and progression to evaluate the effect of therapy on tumor infiltrating lymphocyte populations, whole exome DNA sequencing, and correlate with outcome to assess predictive value. Enrollment has completed and the study is ongoing. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02849496.<br \/>Results: 78 patients with BRCAmt advanced breast cancer were enrolled between 5\/3\/2018 and 3\/17\/2022 and available for analysis. Groups were generally well matched on baseline characteristics. PFS was 7.0 months (95% CI 5.5-11.5) in O arm and 7.67 months (95% CI 5.6-10) in O+A arm (p=0.92). Median OS was 26.5 months (95% CI 19.2- NR) in O arm and 22.4 months (95% CI 16.6-31.3) in O+A arm (p=0.3). In triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subgroup (n=23), there was no significant difference in PFS (p=0.92) or OS (p=0.6). Treatment was generally well tolerated with expected side effects, with O+A group experiencing more adverse events of all grades. Analysis of tumor samples from serial biopsies will be presented separately.<br \/>Conclusion: Olaparib or combination olaparib + atezolizumab resulted in clinically meaningful PFS in both treatment arms. Addition of atezolizumab did not significantly increase PFS. Treatment in both arms was generally well tolerated with expected side effects based on prior drug profiles. This is the first randomized trial to show that the addition of immunotherapy (atezolizumab) to PARPi (olaparib) in patients with advanced BRCAmt breast cancer does not add to therapeutic response but carries with it additional toxicities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP inhibitors,Immunotherapy,Breast cancer,Advanced cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kristina A.

Achievement of pCR is associated with improved overall survival (OS). Therefore, several studies have used IC before CRT to improve pCR rates but saw mixed results. We used a novel combination of FTD\/TPI and oxaliplatin as IC before the standard CRT in localized EGAC with the primary objective of increasing the pCR rate.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Methods: <\/b>We enrolled patients (pts) in this open-label, single-arm, multicenter, phase II trial between Jan 2020 and Oct 2022. Pts with potentially resectable EGAC, adequate organ function, ECOG performance status of 0 -1, age &#60;76 years, and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-determined node-positive disease with any T-stage or T3-T4a with any N stage were eligible. Pts received three cycles of IC with FTD\/TPI (35 mg\/m&#178; BID, days 1-5 every 14 days) and oxaliplatin (85 mg\/m&#178; every 14 days on day 1). Pts then underwent concurrent CRT (radiation dose of 5040 cGY) with weekly Carboplatin (AUC 2) and Paclitaxel (50 mg\/m2) for 6 weeks, followed by surgery. The primary objective was to evaluate the pCR rate. The secondary objectives were 2-year disease-free survival (DFS), 2-year OS, and toxicities. Using a Simon two-stage design, we enrolled 22 evaluable patients in stage 1 with at least 5 pCRs to proceed to stage 2. We collected blood samples at different time points to measure circulating tumor DNA (Ct DNA) as a correlative endpoint. Clinical trial information: NCT04097028.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Results:<\/b> Of the 22 enrolled pts, 19 (86.4%) were male, and 20 (90.9%) were Caucasian. The median age was 61 years, and 12 (54.5%) had a primary disease at the gastroesophageal junction. Twenty (90.9%) pts had T3 disease, and 15 (68.2%) had node-positive disease by EUS. IC led to a 35% or more reduction in SUVmax in 60% of patients before CRT. At the time of data cutoff, 13 (59.1%) had surgery, 1 (4.5%) was awaiting surgery, 5 (22.7%) had progressive disease during the study, and 3 (13.6%) discontinued the study due to adverse events (AEs). Only 2 pts had pCRs, and an additional 4 had near pCRs. Since we could not meet our pre-defined pCR rate in stage 1, the study was closed due to futility. After a median follow-up of 15.8 months, 2-year OS and DFS were 43% and 41%, respectively. Nine (40.9%) had grade 3 or higher AEs. Nausea (59.1%) and fatigue (59.1%) were the most common treatment-related AEs; these were grade 1-2 events. The most common grade 3 or higher events were neutropenia (13.6%) and lymphopenia (9.1%). No febrile neutropenia was noted.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Conclusion:<\/b> IC with FTD\/TPI and oxaliplatin before standard CRT failed to improve pCR in resectable EGAC, although it was reasonably well tolerated and showed activity. Ct DNA analysis is ongoing and will hopefully identify a select subgroup of pts who may benefit from this approach. <b> <\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Gastrointestinal cancers: other,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sarbajit Mukherjee<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sylvia Alarcon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christos Fountzilas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sarah Chatley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Renuka Iyer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Deepak Vadehra<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Moshim Kukar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristopher Attwood<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anthony George<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alyson Brown<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chih-Yi Liao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hassan Hatoum<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sagila George<\/i><\/presenter>.

The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1. by independent radiology review. Key pre-specified secondary endpoints were safety, disease control rate (DCR), progression-free (PFS) and overall (OS) survival. Pre\/on-treatment biopsies were examined for response biomarkers.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Between 4\/2017 and 7\/2020, 20 patients were enrolled.

Grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (no grade 4\/5) occurred in 7 (35%) patients; most common being elevated CPK (15%) and vomiting (10%). One (5%) patient had grade 3 vomiting, necessitating treatment discontinuation. There appeared to be a marked difference in OS between patients with increased pre-treatment tumor immune infiltration as compared to those lacking immune infiltration amongst patients with RNASeq data available (n=13).

BOLD-100 demonstrated synergy in established preclinical models in combination with various anticancer therapies, particularly in resistant cell lines. In the first interim analysis of the phase 1b dose-escalation component of the clinical trial, BOLD-100 plus FOLFOX was well-tolerated in patients (pts) with advanced GI solid cancers.<br \/>Methods: This is a prospective, Phase 1b dose-escalation (Part A) and Phase 2a dose-expansion (Part B) study of BOLD-100 in combination with FOLFOX for colorectal (CRC), pancreatic (PDAC), gastric (GC) and biliary tract (BTC) cancers. Pts receive BOLD-100 with FOLFOX on day 1 of each 14-day cycle. In Part A, pts were enrolled in a 3+3 design to determine the combination recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), with BOLD-100 dose-escalation (420, 500 and 625 mg\/m2). Part B comprises 4 cohorts treated at the RP2D of 625 mg\/m2 until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. The primary objective of Part B is to evaluate the efficacy of BOLD-100 in three clinical endpoints (PFS, OS, and ORR). Bayesian modelling is used to continually reassess these endpoints; the posterior probability of superiority to a historical landmark for each endpoint.<br \/>Results: As of 31 Dec 2022, 17 pts with advanced metastatic colorectal cancer median age 62 years were treated. Pts received a median of 4 prior systemic therapies, 14 had received prior FOLFOX and 16 (94%) were enrolled with stage IV disease. Median number of cycles completed was 7 (range 1-12). Median PFS was 4.7 [2.9,8.6] months, median OS 9.8 [5.2,22] months, and ORR 13% [3,36] compared to the historical benchmark of 2.0 months, 7.1 months, and 1.6% respectively for similar patients treated with approved standard of care. Two pts achieved a partial response and 11 pts had stable disease for an overall disease control rate of 87% (13\/15 [64%,97%]). This compares favorably to the historical control 44%. 16 pts reported 1 or more treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), most commonly neutrophil count decreased (n=9, 52.9%), fatigue (n=6, 35.3%), pyrexia (n=4, 23.5%), platelet count decreased (n=4, 23.5%) and decreased appetite (n=4, 23.5%).

Onatasertib (ATG-008) is a 2<sup>nd<\/sup> generation mTOR inhibitor which inactivates both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Our previous clinical investigation (NCT01177397) has demonstrated preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of onatasertib across multiple solid and hematologic malignancies, with encouraging signals of activity in subjects with hepatitis B virus (HBV)+ unresectable, refractory HCC.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Asian patients with advanced HBV+ HCC who had experienced progressive disease after at least 1 line of systemic therapy were enrolled in this study. Onatasertib was administered orally once a day (QD) at 3 dose levels (15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg) or 20 mg twice daily (BID). The primary endpoints were pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and efficacy (NCT03591965).<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: As of July 11, 2022, 73 patients were enrolled and evaluated. The median age was 52.0 years and the median follow up duration was 26.5 months. The mean number of prior lines was 1.8. 63 patients (86.3%) had at least one Grade 3-4 treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE), and 25 (34.2%) had at least one serious adverse event (SAE) . Among the 73 subjects, 3 achieved confirmed partial response (PR), all in the 45 mg QD cohort. 18 pts were enrolled in the 45 mg QD cohort, in which 11 (61.1%) pts had received at least 2 prior lines of systemic therapy and 15 (83.3%) pts had been exposed to an anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 antibody. The overall response rate (ORR) in the 45 mg QD cohort was 16.7%. The median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 3.0 months (95% CI 1.9, 4.6) in the intention to treat (ITT) population and was 5.3 months (95% CI 1.9, 7.6) in the 45mg QD cohort. Median overall survival time (mOS) was not evaluable in the 45 mg QD cohort and the mOS was 13.4 months (95% CI 7.4, 19.8) in the ITT population. Onatasertib demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics between 15 mg QD and 45 mg QD in this Asian population and there was no significant exposure accumulation after multiple dosing, as previously seen in the US population.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Onatasertib (ATG-008) showed encouraging single agent antitumor activity in patients with HBV+ advanced HCC after at least 1 prior systemic therapy, notably in the 45 mg QD dose level, in which most patients had been previously exposed to anti-PD-L1\/PD-1 therapy. The results indicates that onatasertib has potential efficacy in HBV+ HCC patients who failed prior CPI treatment. Further study may be warranted, particularly in HBV+ HCC patients who have failed prior anti-VEGFR and anti-PDL1\/PD-1 therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"mTOR,Hepatitis B virus,Hepatocellular carcinoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shukui Qin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoyan Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhiqaing Meng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhenggang Ren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuxian Bai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shanzhi Gu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Li Zheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Qiu Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sun-Yong Oh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yabing Guo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yoong-Koo Kang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei-Yu Kao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jung-Hwan Yoon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Helong Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pei-Jer Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tsai-Sheng Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeong Heo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhendong Zheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hui Xie<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhinuan Yu<\/i><\/presenter>.

We performed a single-arm prospective phase II clinical trial utilizing a novel treatment paradigm optimizing the utility of SBRT based on the individual patient&#8217;s probability for tumor control traded off against the risk of liver injury. We hypothesized that maximizing the utility of treatment would decrease toxicity while achieving the same tumor control rate as standard therapy.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Patients with Child-Pugh (CP) A to B7 disease with tumors &#62;3.5 cm, or CP &#8805; B8 with any size tumor were prospectively enrolled on an IRB approved clinical trial to undergo SBRT with baseline dose optimization and mid-treatment response adaptation. Optimization and adaptation were based on the expected utility of treatment, calculated as a weighted average of the probability of 4 combinations of toxicity and efficacy outcomes. These calculations were based on the individual patient&#8217;s baseline indocyanine green retention at 15 minutes or albumin-bilirubin score (ALBI), CP score, intended dose and fractionation, and mean liver dose with the goal of maximizing the difference between the probability of local control compared to the probability of treatment-related toxicity. Primary endpoints were rate of liver decompensation as measured by &#8805;2 point change in CP score within 6 months, and lesion-specific local control. Overlap weighting was used to compare patients treated on protocol with patients receiving conventional SBRT at another high-volume cancer center.<br \/><b> <\/b> <b>Results:<\/b> 56 patients with 80 tumors met inclusion criteria and had a median follow-up of 11.2 months. 44 tumors with a median size of 3.8 cm were treated in CP-A to B7 patients, while 36 tumors with a median size of 2.1 cm were treated in CP &#8805; B8 patients. Optimization resulted modification of initial dose for 38% of patients. Sixty-eight percent of patients underwent mid-treatment adaptation with either omission or dose reduction of the final two treatments based on change in expected utility. The 1 year freedom from local progression was 94%. A total of 21% of patients experienced a &#8805; 2 point change in CP score within 6 months. Overlap weighted analysis revealed similar local control (HR 0.69, 95% CI [0.25-1.91], p = 0.48), and overall survival (HR 1.45, 95% CI [0.69-3.0], p = 0.33), with decreased toxicity (OR 0.26, 95% CI [0.07 - 0.99], p = 0.048) compared to conventional SBRT.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> SBRT for HCC patients with large tumors or poor liver function can be optimized via an individualized, utility-based treatment paradigm which may decrease treatment-related toxicity while maintaining tumor control.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,Radiation therapy,Toxicity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Daniel J.

In a Phase 1 monotherapy study, cinrebafusp alfa was well tolerated and showed single agent activity in patients with HER2-positive malignancies. Based on pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics and clinical efficacy data, a loading dose of 18mg\/kg Q2W in cycle 1 followed by 8mg\/kg Q2W in subsequent cycles as maintenance dose was chosen for the Phase 2 study.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>This Phase 2 study enrolled patients with metastatic gastric\/gastroesophageal junction cancer and confirmed HER2-high status (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+ with HER2\/neu gene amplification) who had received one or two prior lines of treatment. Patients received cinrebafusp alfa in combination with ramucirumab and paclitaxel. Primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), and key secondary endpoints included safety profile, PK, and immunogenicity.<br \/><b>Summary of data: <\/b>5 patients were enrolled before enrollment ceased for reasons unrelated to safety or efficacy profile. As of the cut-off date (19-Dec-2022), 5 out of 5 patients achieved a partial response (PR) as best overall response with tumor lesion shrinkage ranging between 35% and 66%. Two of the PRs have been confirmed, one PR is unconfirmed, and 2 patients with currently unconfirmed PRs are continuing to receive treatment. In total, 2 of 5 patients discontinued treatment due to disease progression after 140 and 113 days (patient discontinued cinrebafusp alfa after 42 days but continued on ramucirumab and paclitaxel); 3 patients remain on treatment. Median duration of response was 3.8 months at time of data cut-off. The most frequent treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) included Grade 1\/2 fatigue (4 patients) and Grade 1-3 diarrhea (4 patients). Infusion related reactions (Grade 2\/3) were seen in 1 patient, leading eventually to discontinuation of cinrebafusp alfa. With regards to prior treatment history, all patients received trastuzumab and chemotherapy. 2 patients also received trastuzumab deruxtecan while 4 patients previously received anti-PD1 therapy.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>The combination of cinrebafusp alfa with ramucirumab and paclitaxel was safe and tolerated in the 5 patients treated.

The primary endpoint was radiographic objective response rate by RECIST 1.1. ctDNA was extracted and profiled from serially banked plasma samples (every other treatment cycle) using CLIA certified 152-gene next generation sequencing (NGS) panel assay, PredicineCARE<sup>TM<\/sup>.<br \/>Results:Sixty one patients were screened for the study of whom 24 were ineligible. Thirty-seven patients were enrolled, and one withdrew consent prior to starting. Thirty-six patients were evaluable for efficacy and safety. The median follow-up was 23.2 months (IQR: 11.0 - 46.9 months). All enrolled patients are now off study. Radiographic objective response rate was 81%. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 14.0 months (95% CI, 11.3 -36.4) and 23.2 months (95% CI, 16.6-36.4), respectively. The most common grade 3-4 toxicities were diarrhea, peripheral neuropathy, and hypertension. Baseline ctDNA profiling identified HER2 amplifications in 76.7% of tested cases (23\/30). Baseline ctDNA based tumor fraction (TF) was highly prognostic and TF &#62; 50<sup>th<\/sup> centile had a statistically significantly worse PFS of 11.3 months (95% CI 5.2-18) vs. 22.7 months (95% CI 18.1-NA), p value = 0.0013, and OS of 15.4 months (95% CI 8.0-27.6) vs. 28.0 months (95% CI 17.8-NA), p value = 0.022. 56.7% of cases (17\/30) had alternative MAPK drivers present in pretreatment ctDNA, most commonly amplifications in <i>EGFR<\/i>, <i>FGFR1<\/i>, <i>MET<\/i>, and <i>KRAS<\/i>. Additional MAPK alterations were associated with worse PFS of 12.5 months (95% CI 5.2-NA) vs. 22.7 months (95% CI 8.5-NA), p-value = 0.0067, and OS of 16.5 months (95% CI 8.0-27.6) vs. 32.3 months (95% CI 17.8-NA), p-value = 0.015. 19 cases had plasma profiled at time of clinical resistance of whom 10 showed new oncogenic mutations not detectable in the matched baseline sample. These included mutations in MAPK pathway (<i>KRAS<\/i>, <i>NRAS<\/i>, <i>BRAF<\/i>, <i>HER2<\/i>; n = 1 each) and PI3K pathway (<i>PTEN<\/i>, <i>PIK3CA<\/i>; n = 1 each), suggesting a role in therapeutic resistance.<br \/>Conclusions:The combination of CAPOX, trastuzumab and bevacizumab shows striking clinical activity comparable to novel triplet regimens that include PD1 blockade for HER2+ GEAs . Further evaluation of VEGF mAb in combination with chemoimmunotherapy and anti-PD1 regimens is warranted. Diagnostic ctDNA profiling identifies cases with high TF and alternative MAPK drivers who have worse outcomes.

Petosemtamab is a human, common light chain, IgG1 bispecific antibody with enhanced ADCC activity targeting EGFR and LGR5, which has shown potent antitumor activity in patient (pt)-derived xenograft models of gastric and esophageal cancer. The dose escalation part of an ongoing phase 1\/2 study is completed (JCO 2021:39.3 Sup 62). In the expansion part, petosemtamab is being investigated at the RP2D (1500 mg Q2W, 4-week cycle) in pts with selected advanced solid tumors, including GEA. Primary objective (expansion): investigator-assessed ORR per RECIST 1.1. Secondary objectives: ORR, DOR, PFS (per investigator and central review), OS, and safety and tolerability. Key eligibility criteria: advanced\/metastatic GEA, prior exposure to &#8805;2 lines of standard therapy, ECOG PS 0-1, measurable disease (RECIST 1.1), available baseline tumor biopsy. At the data cutoff date of 24 October 2022, 14 GEA pts were treated at the RP2D. Median age was 63 years (range 40-80), ECOG PS 0\/1: 3\/11 pts, and 79% of pts were male. Primary tumor locations were esophagus (57%), stomach (36%), and gastroesophageal junction (7%), and all were adenocarcinoma histology. Pts received a median of 3 lines of prior systemic therapy (range 1-4) including platinum-based chemotherapy (100%) and checkpoint inhibitors (14%). 3\/14 pts had EGFR overexpression (H score &#8805;200). A median of 2 treatment cycles (range 1-24) was administered, with 1 pt continuing therapy at the cutoff. Among the 14 pts evaluable for efficacy (&#8805;2 cycles and &#8805;1 postbaseline scan, or early progression) limited activity was seen, however 1 pt with tumor EGFR protein overexpression and gene copy number amplification (CNA) showed a confirmed sustained PR (67% tumor reduction; response ongoing after 24 cycles) and 3 pts had SD (1 with EGFR overexpression and gene CNA; 2 not evaluable for IHC), with tumor reductions of 2%, 17%, and 40%. Among 78 pts treated at the RP2D (escalation and all expansion cohorts; cutoff 28 November 2022), the most frequent AEs regardless of causality (all grades\/G3-4) were rash (33%\/0%), hypotension (26%\/6%), dyspnea (26%\/4%), nausea (26%\/1%), dermatitis acneiform (24%\/1%), blood magnesium decreased (19%\/5%), erythema (19%\/0%), diarrhea (19%\/0%); IRRs (composite term) were reported in 74%\/21% of pts, mostly at the first infusion, and all resolved. 5 pts (6%) discontinued treatment due to IRRs on Day 1. 1 esophageal cancer pt died due to unrelated G5 GI bleeding. Petosemtamab demonstrated promising clinical efficacy among patients with pretreated GEA having EGFR gene amplification and\/or overexpression, with a manageable safety profile.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Esophageal cancer,Bispecific antibody,EGFR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Marc Díez García<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Antoine Hollebecque<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rocio Garcia-Carbonero<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christiane Jungels<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisabeth Smyth<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shumei Kato<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Guillem Argilés<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carlos Gomez Martin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marina Magin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu-Ming Shen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Renée De Leeuw<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mohamed Bekradda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eduardo Pennella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ernesto Wasserman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Viktoriya Stalbovskaya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeroen Lammerts van Bueren<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aline Engbers<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrew Joe<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Josep Tabernero<\/i><\/presenter>.

Evidence suggest that high dose rate brachytherapy (HDR) and androgen depravation therapy (ADT) can serve as immune modulators. We hypothesize that the combination of HDR, ADT, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) may synergize to improve immune response and disease control. Here we report an interim analysis of a single-center single-arm phase II trial exploring this novel combination therapy with nivolumab for GG5 PCa.<br \/>Patients were enrolled from 9\/2018 to 4\/2021 and required to have GG5 PCa with &#62; 30% positive cores and receive ICI plus SOC regimen, comprising ADT, external beam RT (EBRT), and HDR. ICI (240 mg) was administered every 2 weeks for 4 doses beginning 4 weeks prior to HDR. HDR consisted of two 1150 cGy implants. EBRT followed HDR and consisted of 4500 cGy in 25 fractions. Total ADT length and elective nodal radiotherapy were per physician discretion. Biopsies were taken at time of diagnosis, HDR, and 1-month post HDR. Biopsy tumor samples underwent genomic profiling. Major pathologic response (MPR) was defined as &#60; 17% positive cores. Wilcoxon test and Area Under the Curve (AUC) Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves were used for statistical analyses. Toxicity was evaluated according to CTCAE v5.0. The historic control cohort consisted of all patients treated with SOC between 1\/2013 to 11\/2021 and met all study inclusion\/exclusion criteria. Cox regression was used to calculate 2-year (2Y) risk of metastasis with censorship at 24 months (m). Median follow up (mFUP) defined from diagnostic biopsy.<br \/>Of 34 patients who received 2 or more doses of ICI, 1 patient (3%) experienced a dose limiting toxicity of autoimmune hepatitis (AH). The incidence of all grade 3 toxicity related to ICI at 3 and 6 months were both 3% (n=1; AH and QT prolongation, respectively). There was no grade 4+ toxicity at 3 m, nor any grade 3+ toxicity at 6 m. Two subjects were withdrawn from study, leaving 32 evaluable for clinical outcomes. mFUP of ICI cohort was 32 m with a 2Y PSA failure rate of 6%. CD8A, STING, ANPEP, and multiple immune signatures were associated with an early MPR (p &#60; 0.05) with ICI. The Ricketts_Immunosuppression genomic signature strongly correlated with MPR to ICI (AUC = 0.7, p = 0.01). The control cohort consisted of 59 patients with a mFUP of 35 m and a 2Y PSA failure rate of 19%. ICI demonstrated an 88% reduction in 2Y risk of metastasis compared to controls (HR = 0.12, 95% CI, 0.02 - 1.0, p = 0.05).<br \/>Combination of ICI with SOC for GG5 PCa is safe and associated with a clinically significant improvement in disease control. Key genomic features were identified to predict for early MPR to ICI. Ricketts_Immunosuppression was identified as a potential biomarker for ICI-sensitive tumor subtypes. Final analyses are anticipated in late 2023.

Increased activation of thePI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in mCRPC contributes to tumor progression and represents an important therapeutic target. Preclinical studies have shown that PI3K inhibitors (PI3Ki) impair HR and sensitize cancer cells to PARPi even in the absence of HR gene mutations. We hypothesize that dual PI3K and PARP inhibition may improve clinical outcomes of mCRPC. We describe preliminary results of a phase Ib\/II study investigating safety of the combination of copanlisib (pan-class I PI3Ki) and rucaparib (PARP-1, -2 and -3 inhibitor).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Enrollment criteria included progressive mCRPC, prior androgen inhibitors (abiraterone, enzalutamide, and\/or apalutamide); prior taxane chemotherapy was allowed. HR defects (HRD) was not required for the phase Ib but was an inclusion criterion for the Phase II component of the trial. The phase I followed a standard 3+3 escalation design. Dose level (DL) 1 consisted of rucaparib 400 mg PO BID continuously and copanlisib 45 mg IV days 1, 8 and 15 every 28 days; in DL -1 the copanlisib was reduced to 45 mg days 1 and 15 only. Adverse events (AE) were graded by CTCAE v5.0. The primary aim of the phase I was to establish the MTD and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of copanlisib in combination with rucaparib.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Thirteen patients were enrolled with a median age of 64 (55-78) and a median baseline PSA of 11.7 ng\/mL (0.015-1939.2). Nine patients (69%) received prior chemotherapy (docetaxel [6], cabazitaxel [3]). Seven patients had HRD (54%) <i>BRCA1<\/i> (1), <i>BRCA2<\/i> (4), <i>CDK12<\/i> (1), and <i>FANCA<\/i> (1). Treatment-related AEs included grade 2 (G2) leukopenia (46%), G2\/G3 anemia (31%), G2\/G3 rash (31%). Two dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed in 5 patients treated in DL 1: G3 rash and G3 AST\/ALT elevation attributed to both drugs. Six patients were treated at DL -1 without DLTs; this was identified as the RP2D. Two additional patients have been treated at this dose in Phase II of the study. By RECIST 1.1 criteria, one patient (8%) achieved a partial response (BRCA1 mutation) and three (23%) achieved stable disease resulting in a clinical benefit rate of 30.7%. Median duration of treatment was 12 weeks. One patient harboring a PALB2 VUS mutation remained on treatment for 21.7 months. Of 13 evaluable patients, there were 2 confirmed PSA responses (15%) (one patient without an HRD and one with a BRCA1 mutation).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> The combination of rucaparib and copanlisib is well tolerated. The RP2D was rucaparib 400mg BID with copanlisib 45mg (D1, D15; 28-day cycle) with signal of efficacy in patients with and without HRD.

Augmenting endocrine therapy by targeting CDK4\/6 with abemaciclib has dramatically improved outcomes in HR+ breast cancer. Similar to ER, AR signaling activates CDK4 &#38; 6 and abemaciclib showed preclinical anti-tumor activity in prostate cancer (PC). This signal seeking single arm Phase 2 study evaluated the safety and clinical activity of abemaciclib monotherapy in pts with heavily pretreated poor prognosis mCRPC who progressed after both a novel hormonal agent (NHA) and two taxanes.<br \/>Methods: Eligible pts had progressive mCRPC, measurable disease by RECIST1.1, and previously received &#8805;1 NHA, docetaxel, and cabazitaxel for metastatic PC. Abemaciclib was administered at 200 mg BID on a continuous 28-day dosing schedule. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate without concurrent bone progression (ORR). A target ORR of &#8805;12.5% was deemed suitable to support further evaluation of abemaciclib monotherapy in this refractory mCRPC setting. Key secondary endpoints included disease control rate (DCR), time to PSA progression, radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), overall survival (OS), and safety.<br \/>Results: Forty-four pts (median age 68 yrs; 75% ECOG PS 1, median PSA of 96 ng\/mL) were enrolled. In total, 46.5% had visceral metastasis, including 27.9% with liver metastases. Median time from development of mCRPC to study entry was 2.1 yrs and the median number of prior systemic regimens for mCRPC was 3. Median number of treatment cycles was 3 (1-13). Three pts had confirmed soft tissue response without concurrent bone progression (ORR: 6.8%). Seventeen pts (38.6%) had stable disease, of which 6 (13.6%) lasted &#8805;6 months (mos); DCR was 45.5%. Median rPFS was 2.7 mos (95% CI 1.9, 3.7); 6-mos rPFS rate was 24.9% (95% CI 12.4, 39.5); median time to PSA progression was 6.5 mos. Median OS was 7.6 mos (95% CI 5.6, NE). Any grade (G) TRAEs experienced by &#8805;50% of pts were diarrhea (79.5%), decreased appetite (52.3%) and fatigue (50%); majority were G1\/2. G3 TRAEs in &#8805; 5% of pts were neutropenia (22.7%), anemia (6.8%), fatigue (6.8%) and diarrhea (6.8%). There were no G4 or G5 TRAEs. Discontinuation rate due to AE was 13.6%.<br \/>Conclusions: Abemaciclib demonstrated modest but objective single-agent clinical activity in pts with very heavily pretreated progressive mCRPC. The safety profile of abemaciclib was consistent with the experience in breast cancer. Although the primary endpoint was not formally met, the single agent activity observed in this late line mCRPC setting validates CDK4\/6 as a therapeutic target in advanced PC. The CYCLONE 2 and CYCLONE 3 studies are currently evaluating abemaciclib in combination with abiraterone\/prednisone to leverage synergy of combined CDK4\/6 and hormonal inhibition in first line mCRPC and mHSPC settings, respectively.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK4\/6 inhibitors,advanced prostate cancer,,Abemaciclib,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Neeraj Agarwal<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Castellano Guana<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Teresa A.

BET inhibitors may be effective in reversing platinum resistance in ovarian cancer (OC) and may generate synthetic lethality with ARID1A loss. PLX2853 is an orally active, small molecule inhibitor of BET bromodomain-mediated interactions that exhibits low nanomolar potency in blocking all 4 BET family members (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT). PLX2853 development is continuing at Opna Bio as OPN-2853. Clinical experience with PLX2853 monotherapy in subjects with heavily pretreated solid tumors and lymphoma showed signs of activity. The current study (NCT04493619) was designed as a multicenter, open-label trial with two parallel arms: (1) a phase 2a study of PLX2853 <i>monotherapy<\/i> in advanced gynecological malignancies with a known ARID1A mutation and (2) a phase Ib\/2a <i>combination<\/i> study of PLX2853 plus carboplatin in platinum resistant OC. The primary objective of the Ib portion of the study was safety and tolerability, with the primary objective of both phase 2a portions being efficacy. In the monotherapy arm, up to 6 patients were treated at 80 mg PLX2853 daily in a safety lead-in, with progression to phase 2a using a Simon 2-stage design if dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed in fewer than 33% subjects. In Stage 1, 6 additional subjects (N=12 total) were planned, with progression to stage 2 if two or more patients responded in stage 1. The combination arm included an escalation phase Ib. Three to six evaluable subjects were planned for each group, with dose escalation pending less than 33% DLT rate. The combination arm defined by the phase 1b portion of the study continued to a planned phase 2a Simon 2 stage design similar to that described for the monotherapy arm. 34 of 37 enrolled patients were evaluable with data from at least 1 post-baseline response (14 monotherapy, 20 combination therapy). Of the 14 evaluable patients on the monotherapy arm, 1 (7.1%) achieved a partial response (PR) with progression-free survival of 278 days, 5 (35.7%) had stable disease (SD) and 8 (57.1%) had progressive disease (PD). Of the 20 evaluable OC patients on the PLX2843 + carboplatin combination, 1 (5.0%) had PR, 9 (45.0%) had SD, and 10 (50%) had PD. This study in a larger cohort of gynecologic cancer patients confirmed the safety profile of the agent and demonstrated the feasibility of combination with carboplatin. While these results did not meet the pre-specified response criteria, evidence of clinical activity nevertheless highlights the rationale for further exploration of BRD4 inhibitors in patients with ARID1A-mutated gynecologic malignancies, possibly in combination with agents targeting potential feedback mechanisms such as the PI3K pathway, frequently activated in these cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BET inhibitor,Endometrial cancer,Ovarian cancer,ARID1A,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elizabeth M.

This study presents the first results of ipilimumab and nivolumab in the non-epithelial ovarian tumor cohort (#13) of the SWOG S1609 Dual Anti-CTLA-4 &#38; Anti-PD-1 blockade in Rare Tumors (DART) trial.<br \/>Methods: DART is a prospective, open-label, multicenter\/multi-cohort phase 2 clinical trial of ipilimumab (1mg\/kg intravenously every 6 weeks) plus nivolumab (240mg intravenously every 2 weeks). This cohort included several histologies grouped for statistical analysis. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) (RECIST v1.1) (confirmed complete (CR) and partial responses (PR)); progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), stable disease (SD) &#62;6 months, and toxicity are secondary endpoints.<br \/>Results: Seventeen evaluable patients (median age, 64 years) were analyzed. The subtypes of non-epithelial ovarian cancer were: granulosa cell (47%, n=8), carcinosarcoma or malignant mixed Mullerian tumor (MMMT; 35%, n=6), one each for Wolffian duct, yolk sac, and Sertoli-Leydig cell. There were 2 responses in the 8 patients with granulosa cell (ORR of 25% in the granulosa cell tumors): 1CR (79% regression [due to lymph node &#60; 1.0cm], 59 month PFS, juvenile type) and 1 PR (79% regression, 51+ month PFS, adult type). 6\/8 patients remain alive (PFS 52-1774 days). In contrast, carcinosarcomas showed no responses. One patient with Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor had a 22% response and 341 day PFS. Overall ORR was 12% (2\/17), clinical benefit rate (CBR; no progression &#62; 6months) of 29.4%. The median PFS was 3.5 months, median OS was 42.5 months. The most common adverse events were fatigue (52.9%, n=9) and hypothyroidism (35.3%, n=6). Grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 47.1% of patients (n=8). There were 3 adverse events (17.6%) that led to discontinuation, of which 2 (11.8%) were grade 3-4. There were no grade 5 adverse events.<br \/>Conclusion: Ipilimumab plus nivolumab in non-epithelial ovarian cancer resulted in an ORR of 12% (with 2 of 8 patients with granulosa ovarian tumors showing a durable CR and PR [both, &#62;4 years)) and CBR of 29.4%, with durable responses seen. In contrast there were no responses in the carcinosarcoma group. One patient with Sertoli Leydig cell tumor suggested a possible benefit. Correlative studies to determine response and resistance markers are ongoing. Expanded prospective studies in granulosa tumor but not carcinosarcoma are warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nivolumab,Ipilimumab,Non-epithelial ovarian tumor,DART,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Young Kwang Chae<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Megan Othus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandip Pravin Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kelly J.

Small cell ovarian carcinoma, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) is a rare tumor characterized by loss of SMARC 2\/4 function and so presents a novel paradigm for the treatment of SWI\/SNF pathway deficient tumors (Petar Jelinic et al., 2018; Marc Tischkowitz et al., 2020). This study presents the first results of ipilimumab and nivolumab used in the SCCOHT cohort (#49) of the SWOG S1609 Dual Anti-CTLA-4 &#38; Anti-PD-1 blockade in Rare Tumors (DART) trial.<br \/>Methods: DART is a prospective, open-label, multicenter\/multi-cohort phase 2 clinical trial of ipilimumab (1mg\/kg intravenously every 6 weeks) plus nivolumab (240mg intravenously every 2 weeks). The primary endpoint includes objective response rate (ORR) (RECIST v1.1) (confirmed complete (CR) and partial responses (PR)). Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), stable disease (SD) &#62;6 months, and toxicity.<br \/>Results: Five evaluable patients (median age 30) with SCCOHT were analyzed. Objective response rate was 20% (1 CR with 100% regression). The patient with CR has a duration of response (DoR) and OS of 35+ months. Another patient, showed unconfirmed PR with 81% regression (DoR 4 months), this patient went on to have confirmed iCR (CR confirmed by iRECIST) at around 24 months and has OS of 38+ months. At 12 months, 3 patients remain alive and 1 patient remains progression free; overall median PFS was 1.8 months (1.0-&#8734;); median OS was 24 months (4.5-&#8734;). The most common adverse events were fatigue, nausea, pruritus, dry mouth, maculo-papular rash and aspartate aminotransferase elevation (50%, n=2, respectively). There were two incidents (33.3%) of grade 3-4 adverse events. None of the adverse events led to discontinuation. There were no grade 5 adverse events.<br \/>Conclusion: Ipilimumab plus nivolumab in five patients with the ultra-rare small cell ovarian carcinoma (hypercalcemic type) resulted in one CR durable at 35+ months and one unconfirmed PR with 81% regression. This is the first prospective study demonstrating efficacy of nivolumab and ipilimumab in this rare disease. Correlative studies to determine response and resistance markers are ongoing. Expanded prospective studies in small cell ovarian histologies are needed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nivolumab,Ipilimumab,Small cell ovarian carcinoma hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT),DART,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Young Kwang Chae<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Megan Othus<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sandip P.

TV is also being evaluated in several advanced solid tumors known to express TF, including SCCHN; antitumor activity has been observed at the approved dose level. Previous reports show that modifying the dosing schedule to optimize key PK parameters such as AUC, C<sub>max<\/sub>, and C<sub>trough<\/sub> can lead to further improvement in clinical efficacy. A population PK model based on 399 pts across clinical trials suggests that when TV is administered at 1.7 mg\/kg IV on Days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle (Q2W), pts are predicted to achieve 24% higher AUC, a higher C<sub>trough<\/sub> level, and a lower C<sub>max<\/sub>, compared with the approved cervical cancer regimen (2.0 mg\/kg Q3W). Here, we report the first analysis of TV 1.7mg\/kg Q2W for r\/m SCCHN that has progressed after prior platinum combination with or without immunotherapy.<br \/>Methods: innovaTV 207 (NCT03485209) is an open label phase 2 multi-center study evaluating TV monotherapy or in combination for advanced tumors, including pts with r\/m SCCHN. In Part C of the study, eligible pts could have received up to 3 lines of systemic therapy for r\/m disease and must have received prior therapy with a platinum-based regimen and a checkpoint inhibitor (CPI), if eligible. TV was administered at 1.7 mg\/kg IV Q2W. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), and secondary endpoints included safety and tolerability.<br \/>Results: At data cutoff (28Nov2022), 15 pts with SCCHN were treated. The median number of prior lines for r\/m disease was 2. All pts received prior platinum therapy and majority (93%) received a CPI. 67% of pts received cetuximab and 53% received taxanes, for r\/m SCCHN. Confirmed ORR was 40% (95% CI: 16.3, 67.7), with 1 complete response and 5 partial responses. The safety profile was generally consistent with that observed across TV monotherapy clinical studies. 13 pts experienced a treatment-related adverse event (TRAE), most commonly asthenia (n=7), peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN) (n=7), and vomiting (n=5). 4 pts experienced Grade &#8805;3 TRAEs. 2 pts discontinued treatment due to an AE (PSN and dry eye, n=1 each). 11 pts received 3 or more cycles of treatment (1 cycle = 28 days).<br \/>Conclusions: For pts with r\/m SCCHN who have progressed after prior platinum combination and immunotherapy, TV may be a promising treatment option. Preliminary data suggest encouraging antitumor activity at a higher exposure with Q2W administration while maintaining an acceptable safety profile. The innovaTV 207 study is still enrolling and different dosing regimens are currently being evaluated across advanced solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT05-01 Phase II adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Tissue factor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Beatriz Cirauqui<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sebastien Salas<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>William William<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ariel E.

However, their role in the treatment of ACC and other salivary gland carcinomas is not well established.<br \/>Methods: We performed a Simon&#8217;s two-stage prospective single-institution phase II clinical trial of nivolumab (240 mg intravenously every 2 weeks for 16 weeks, then 480 mg every 4 weeks) with ipilimumab (1 mg\/kg intravenously every 6 weeks), both of which were provided until intolerable toxicity or disease progression. Two cohorts were analyzed: patients with metastatic\/recurrent ACC and patients with other salivary gland cancers. The primary endpoint was median progression-free survival (PFS) based on RECIST and immune-related RECIST (irRECIST) criteria; secondary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and toxicity.<br \/>Results: Patients with ACC (n=19) and other salivary gland carcinomas (total n=5; parotid gland adenocarcinoma (n=3), salivary duct carcinoma (n=1), and myoepithelial carcinoma (n=1)) were enrolled between May 2017 and July 2019. Among the patients with ACC, the median OS was 30.0 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 15.3 months to not reached), the median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI 5.5 - 30.0 months), and the disease control rate (DCR) was 53% (10\/19). The ORR in the ACC group was 5% (CR 0%, n=0; confirmed PR 5%, n=1) using both RECIST and irRECIST criteria, with one patient having continued stable disease at the time of trial conclusion. In the salivary gland tumor cohort, the median OS was 10.4 months (95% CI 6.21 months to not reached), the median PFS time was 6.21 months (95% CI 2.83 months to not reached), and the DCR was 40% (2\/5). The ORR in this cohort was 0% using both RECIST and irRECIST criteria. Across both cohorts, platelet counts above the joint cohort&#8217;s median were significantly associated with better OS (p=0.032) and PFS (p=0.046). Additionally, although not significant, there was a trend for improved OS and PFS among patients with neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios &#62;5 (OS p=0.42, PFS p=0.25) and above median neutrophil counts (OS p=0.24, PFS p=0.18). Four patients with ACC underwent circulating tumor DNA sequencing, resulting in the identification of two MYB-NFIB translocations, one NOTCH1 Cys1383 frameshift mutation, one MTOR N1760K mutation, and one PDGFRA copy number gain. Common immune-related toxicities include fatigue (54%), lymphocytopenia (46%), and anemia (42%) with lymphocytopenia being the most common grade III\/IV adverse event.<br \/>Conclusion: In patients with recurrent or metastatic ACC and other salivary gland neoplasms, combination nivolumab with ipilimumab resulted in moderate disease control.

In the Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) cohort, pts underwent randomization to subsequent treatment based on MRD status after completing Ibr + Ven (Wierda et al, <i>J Clin Oncol<\/i> 2021). Here, 4-yr follow-up (3-yr post-randomization) outcomes are reported for MRD cohort pts randomized to continued Ibr or Ibr + Ven.<br \/><b><i>Methods:<\/i><\/b> 164 pts aged &#60;70 yr with previously untreated CLL received 3 cycles of Ibr then 12 cycles of Ibr + Ven (Ibr 420 mg\/d; Ven ramp-up to 400 mg\/d); a 13<sup>th<\/sup> cycle occurred concurrent with MRD assessment. Pts not meeting criteria for Confirmed undetectable MRD (uMRD Not Confirmed) were randomized to open-label Ibr (n=31) or Ibr + Ven (n=32; 1 additional yr of Ibr + Ven then Ibr alone). Pts with Confirmed uMRD were randomized 1:1 to double-blind placebo or Ibr (n=86).<br \/><b><i>Results:<\/i><\/b> In uMRD Not Confirmed pts, median time on study was 48 mo; post-randomization median follow-up was 33 mo. Improvements in overall best uMRD rates from pre-randomization were: +3% (to 48%) with Ibr and +25% (to 72%) with Ibr + Ven in peripheral blood, and +10% (to 42%) with Ibr and +38% (to 69%) with Ibr + Ven in bone marrow. uMRD rates over time are in the Table. Improvements in complete response (CR) rates were similar with Ibr (+29%) and Ibr + Ven (+28%). 4-yr progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 93% in both arms; 4-yr overall survival (OS) rates were 97% (Ibr) and 100% (Ibr + Ven)<b> <\/b>and consistent with Confirmed uMRD arms (Allan et al, ASH 2022). Adverse events (AEs) generally decreased over time post-randomization (Table) except for hypertension. In this 4<sup>th<\/sup> yr of follow-up (25-36 mo post-randomization), atrial fibrillation was rare (n=1\/arm); no AEs led to drug discontinuation in either arm. With continued Ibr, outcomes in uMRD Not Confirmed pts were similar to those in Confirmed uMRD pts: median time on study, 56 mo; post-randomization median follow-up, 42 mo; CR rate, 81%; 4-yr PFS, 95%; 4-yr OS, 98%.<br \/><b><i>Conclusion: <\/i><\/b>In pts without Confirmed uMRD after Ibr + Ven, continued Ibr + Ven improved uMRD rates; PFS and OS were similarly high with continued Ibr or Ibr + Ven (&#8805;97%).

RT has no approved therapies, poor prognosis, and an estimated median overall survival (OS) of 3-11 months. Pirtobrutinib is a well-tolerated highly selective, non-covalent (reversible) Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) with favorable oral pharmacology and promising efficacy in patients with poor-prognosis B-cell malignancies following prior covalent BTKi therapy. We now report on RT patients from BRUIN.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Patients previously treated for B-cell malignancies were eligible for pirtobrutinib monotherapy in dose escalation\/expansion within the phase 1\/2 BRUIN study. Key endpoints: investigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR) per Lugano 2014 criteria, and safety. The response-evaluable cohort consisted of patients with RT who completed either first response assessment or discontinued therapy. The safety cohort consisted of patients who received &#8805;1 dose of pirtobrutinib monotherapy (n=725). Data cut was 31 January 2022.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Of 57 RT patients (median age: 67 years), 91% (n=52) received at least 1 prior RT-directed therapy. Median lines of prior RT therapy were 2: (anti-CD20 antibody [86%, n=49], chemotherapy [79%, n=45], BCL&#8209;2 inhibitor [35%, n=20], BTKi [28%, n=16], PI3K inhibitor [12%, n=7], CAR-T [9%, n=5], immunomodulator [5%, n=3], stem cell transplant [4%, n=2], other systemic therapy [33%, n=19]) and median lines of prior CLL were 2: (BTKi [60%, n=34], anti-CD20 antibody [60%, n=34], chemotherapy [47%, n=27], BCL&#8209;2 inhibitor [42%, n=24], immunomodulator [9%, n=5], PI3K inhibitor [7%, n=4], stem cell transplant [7%, n=4], CAR-T [2%, n=1], other systemic therapy [11%, n=6]). ORR for patients within phase 2 (n=56, 200mg once\/day starting dose) was 54% (95% CI, 39-68): 5 complete responses, 22 partial responses. Median DoR was 8.6 months (95% CI, 1.9-NE, 63% censored) and median OS was 13.1 months (95% CI, 7.1-NE) at a median follow up time of 5.5 months and 9.7 months respectively. Six patients electively discontinued pirtobrutinib to pursue curative-intent therapy (allogeneic transplant, n=6, 3.8 months median time-on-therapy). The most frequent TEAEs were fatigue (26%, n=191), diarrhea (22%, n=160), and contusion (19%, n=138). Of Grade&#8805;3 TEAEs, neutropenia (20%, n=143) was the most frequent and hypertension (3%, n=20), hemorrhage (2%, n=16), and atrial fibrillation\/flutter (1%, n=7) were of low grade. Fifteen (2%) patients discontinued due to a treatment-related AE.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Pirtobrutinib demonstrated promising preliminary efficacy and was well tolerated for patients who received prior RT-directed chemoimmunotherapy and covalent BTKi.
