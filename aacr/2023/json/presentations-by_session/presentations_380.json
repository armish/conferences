[{"Abstract":"Super carbonate apatite (sCA) nanoparticle is a superb calcium phosphate delivery system for miRNA and siRNA to tumors (PlosOne 2015). We reported that sCA delivered efficiently siRNA for survivin and PTBP as well as miR-340 (Mol Cancer Ther 2015, 2015) to colon tumors implanted into nude mice. MiR-4689 and miR-29b-1-5p suppressed KRAS mutated colon cancer cells (Mol Ther NA2015, 2018) and miR-302 and miR-369 realized in vivo cancer reprograming (PlosOne 2015). In every case the RNA function was fully realized. Moreover, effect of influenza vaccination was augmented by sCA plus CpG nucleic acid (NA) (Frontiers in Immunol 2018). sCA coupled with miR-29a or miR-29b prevented the DSS (dextran sodium sulfate)-induced inflammatory bowel disease (Mol Ther NA2018). We also applied the sCA-ICG complex to minimally invasive treatment of photodynamic therapy (Mol Cancer Ther 2018). Following these outstanding findings, we tried and succeeded to establish a clinically available novel calcium phosphate delivery system, named cNaD, which controls the nano-particle size and avoids accumulation in normal organs including liver and spleen. It is characterized by its ability to efficiently deliver siRNA and microRNA to cancers and provided prominent therapeutic effect in various mouse models. Safety test has been accomplished in rats and monkeys based on GLP standards. Also, the scale-up manufacturing system &#62;1000 folds has been attained. Our cNaD system will accelerate the development of NA medicine in the world.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Cancer,Drug delivery,Molecular targets,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hirofumi Yamamoto<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Osaka University, Suita, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"39184ad2-e52f-41ae-bd71-99d811e17179","ControlNumber":"4553","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

Although topotecan is also approved in combination with cisplatin for cervical cancer, reductions of dose and administration frequency are required due to safety issues. Similar observations have been reported in combination with other anti-cancer agents. We previously reported on a dihydrosphingomyelin (DHSM)-based novel liposomal topotecan, FF-10850 which has been in a Phase I clinical study for solid tumors including ovarian cancer and Merkel cell carcinoma (NCT04047251). FF-10850 demonstrated superior efficacy and safety to non-liposomal topotecan via preferential tumor accumulation and efficient payload release mediated by both tumor-associated macrophages and ammonia produced by glutaminolysis in the tumor microenvironment. In the present study, we examined if FF-10850 could enhance efficacy in combination with platinum, PARP, and immune checkpoint inhibitors in mice models, leveraging its preferential accumulation in the tumor microenvironment.<br \/>Methods: FF-10850 in combination with carboplatin or olaparib were evaluated in a platinum-sensitive A2780 and a BRCA2-deficient Capan-1 xenograft model, respectively. A CT26 syngeneic model was used for evaluation of FF-10850 in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody. To confirm establishment of tumor-specific immunity with the FF-10850 and anti-PD-1 antibody combination, re-inoculation of CT26 cells and subsequent inoculation of 4T1 cells was performed in mice that achieved durable complete regressions with the prior combination treatment.<br \/>Results: FF-10850 in combination with carboplatin or olaparib significantly improved efficacy compared to each monotherapy without increased body weight loss. Olaparib also attenuated tumor regrowth in a maintenance setting after the completion of FF-10850 monotherapy. Although only 1 or 0 of 8 mice showed complete regression with FF-10850 or anti-PD-1 antibody monotherapy, 6 of 8 mice achieved durable complete regressions with the combination treatment. Furthermore, these mice successfully rejected re-inoculated CT26 cells without subsequent rejection of irrelevant 4T1 cells.<br \/>Conclusion: FF-10850 demonstrated favorable efficacy and safety in combination with carboplatin, olaparib or anti-PD-1 antibody, likely related to preferential tumor drug exposure. The combination of FF-10850 with anti-PD-1 antibody efficiently established tumor-specific immunity and long-lasting tumor suppression. Collectively, these observations strongly support further investigations of FF-10850 and improved efficacy in combination with various anti-cancer agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liposomes,Topoisomerase I inhibitor,Combination therapy,Drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ken Okada<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Toshifumi Kimura<sup>1<\/sup>, Noriyuki Kasagi<sup>1<\/sup>, Mikinaga Mori<sup>1<\/sup>, Susumu Shimoyama<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>FUJIFILM Corporation, Kaisei-machi, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>FUJIFILM Pharmaceuticals, USA, Cambridge, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"fe76530c-4540-4b9f-b84e-e1ec50d6f5a1","ControlNumber":"695","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;K.

Prior reports of small-molecule GSPT1 degraders such as CC-90009 in AML demonstrate potent anti-tumor cytotoxicity, but with a potentially narrow therapeutic index. To increase the efficacy vs. tolerability window of TPDs and improve drug delivery, we introduce TPD-Squared (TPD<sup>2<\/sup> <sup>TM<\/sup>), a dual-targeted protein degradation approach of combining the catalytic mechanism of targeted protein degradation with the precision of tumor-targeting therapeutic antibodies. We have previously shown in vitro and in vivo efficacy with a HER2-targeted TPD<sup>2<\/sup> conjugate: ORM-5029. Following on that success, we generated conjugates using a CD33-targeting antibody (OR000283) produced by engineering the FAb (H&#38;L) sequences from gemtuzumab onto an IgG1 Fc with N297A variant to inhibit Fc-&#947;R binding. Medicinal chemistry optimization of linker-payloads led to the identification of ORM-6151, which is composed of SMol006, a highly potent GSPT1 degrader conjugated to OR000283 via a novel &#946;-glucuronide releasable linker. ORM-6151 treatment in CD33-expressing cell lines showed picomolar activity with 10-1000-fold greater potency compared to several GSPT1 degrader molecules, including CC-90009 or Mylotarg, and had robust activity in Mylotarg-resistant lines (AML193 and Kasumi6). ORM-6151 also exhibited picomolar potency in in vitro cytotoxicity to primary relapsed\/refractory AML patient blasts, with better potency than CC-90009 and Mylotarg. We evaluated ORM-6151 in several in vivo disseminated xenograft models and observed robust efficacy following a single treatment at doses as low as 0.1 mg\/kg. Tumor growth inhibition correlated with the degree and duration of GSPT1 depletion and changes in the expression of previously described integrated stress response biomarker genes. In summary, ORM-6151 is a promising, potential therapy for AML and currently in preclinical development as a first-in-class targeted protein degrader therapy with CD33-targeted delivery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,GSPT1,CD33,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>James Palacino<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Pedro Lee<sup>2<\/sup>, Hangyeol Jeong<sup>2<\/sup>, Yeonjoon Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Yoojin Song<sup>2<\/sup>, Uttapol Permpoon<sup>2<\/sup>, Wesley Wong<sup>1<\/sup>, Chen Bai<sup>1<\/sup>, Nathan Fishkin<sup>1<\/sup>, Khuloud Takouri<sup>1<\/sup>, Eunjun Yu<sup>2<\/sup>, Yong Yi<sup>1<\/sup>, Anna Skaletskaya<sup>1<\/sup>, Min-Soo Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Da-Yeong Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Dong-Ki Choi<sup>2<\/sup>, Peter  U.

The treatment options for managing PDAC are limited to surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. However, surgery is the only treatment option that can cure the disease in about twenty percent of cases. Thus, Gemcitabine (GEM) remains the first-line drug in the clinic for PDAC treatment despite suboptimal clinical effects. These are primarily due to weak drug delivery and the development of chemoresistance resulting from mutant-K-RAS\/AKT\/ERK signaling-mediated desmoplastic cages. Several new therapeutic approaches, including nanoparticle-based drug delivery procedures, are currently being investigated. In this study, we designed a pH-responsive PEG-b-poly (carbonate) block copolymer encapsulated ERK inhibitor (SCH772984) nanoparticles surface functionalized with tumor-penetrating peptide, iRGD to specifically target PDAC tumor tissue. By utilizing the ERKi-encapsulated pH-responsive targeted nanoparticles, we performed a combinational drug treatment of GEM and ERKi. We found that the pH-responsive targeted nanocarrier efficiently released ERKi in the hypoxic environment. The free GEM, combined with nanoencapsulated ERKi, demonstrated significant synergistic outcomes <i>in vitro<\/i> colony forming ability, migration, and motility in pancreatic cancer cell line MiaPaCa2. Moreover, combination therapy significantly enhanced the GEM effect in reducing PDAC growth in KPC mice and increasing the survival of the mice. Thus, our studies indicate that pH-responsive targeted nanocarrier-based delivery of ERKi in the hypoxic area of PDAC enhances the efficacy of GEM in PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ERK,Nanoparticle,Pancreatic cancer,Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Debasmita Dutta<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Archana De<sup>2<\/sup>, Raj Shankar Hazra<sup>3<\/sup>, Pratyusha Ghosh<sup>3<\/sup>, Mohiuddin Quadir<sup>3<\/sup>, Snigdha Banerjee<sup>4<\/sup>, Sushanta  K.

For effective antitumor activity, it is necessary to have direct interactions between cytotoxic T cells and tumor cells. Hyaluronic acid and Iron oxide both have distinctive properties that are advantageous for the development of biocompatible and biodegradable nanoparticle drug delivery systems for cancer. We have developed several targeting and immunomodulatory ligands that can be conjugated to the nanoparticles while carrying chemotherapy or molecular targeted agents for targeted cancer therapy as shown in Table 1. Although the therapeutic efficacy of those targeted nanoparticles has been demonstrated in mouse tumor models, the effect of nanoparticles and their payload drugs on the activities of tumor specific cytotoxic T cells is still unclear. To determine the effect of those nanoparticles on T cell immune responses, CAR T cells provided a well-suited in vitro cellular model. In this study, anti-mesothelin CAR T cells generated from lentiviral CAR T vector transduced T cells were incubated with nanoparticle\/drugs and free drugs. The effect of various nanoparticles on CAR T cell viability, and in vitro cytotoxicity on pancreatic cancer cells was evaluated by live\/dead, Alamarblue and SRB proliferation Assays. Our results showed that the incubation of CAR T cells with targeted nanoparticles\/drugs did not reduce CAR T cells' viability and did not inhibit T cells' activity in killing tumor cells. The ATFmmp14-HANP\/SN38 nanoparticle showed an enhanced effect of CAR T cells. Thus, this nanoparticle\/drug has the potential for the development of combination therapy with CAR T cells to improve the CAR T cell delivery while synergizing anti-tumor effect by targeted drug delivery, stroma modulation, and tumor cell killing by drug and CAR T cells.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{CE910804-3045-4B93-A74C-C938D9674B18}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Nanoparticle Types<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Target<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Payload<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Mechanism of action<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Observed Results (in vivo)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Observed Results (in vitro)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ATFmmp14-HANP\/SN38:ATFmmp14 conjugated HANP<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">uPAR CD44<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">SN38 (an active metabolite of irinotecan)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Inhibits DNA topoiso-merase I, causing DNA single strand breaks and DNA damage.<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Significant tumor growth inhibition in human pancreatic and breast cancer PDX models.<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">HANP more effective towards pancreatic cell line and less toxic against CAR T cells: Greater anti-tumor with combination<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">HANP\/GKT831: HANP<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CD44<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Setanaxib (GKT831:an inhibitor of NOX1 and NOX4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Reduce the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS): DNA repair downregulation, increases DNA damage<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Efficient delivery into mouse breast PDX tumors and sensitizing tumor cells to radiotherapy and DNA damaging agents.<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Nontoxic towards CAR T cells: limited additional therapeutic effects<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PDY1-HANP\/Avasimibe: PD-L1 blocking PDY1 peptide<u> <\/u>conjugated HANP<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PD-L1 CD44<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Avasimibe (Ava), an inhibitor of acyl-Coenzyme A:cholesterolacyltransferase<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Decreases intracellular cholesterol.Inhibit tumor cell growth, Activate cytotoxic T cells<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Efficient delivery into mouse colon tumors, Inhibition of tumor growth: Increased levels of CD8+ T cells and CD68+ Macrophages in tumors<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Nontoxic towards pancreatic cell lines and CAR T cells: limited additional therapeutic effects<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ATFmmp14-IONP-DOX: ATFmmp14 conjugated IONP<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">uPAR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Doxorubicin<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Direct DNA damage and inhibits DNA repair by inhibiting topoisomerase<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Significantly inhibited tumor growth in human pancreatic and breast cancer PDX model<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ATFmmp14-IONP\/DOX more effective towards pancreatic cancer cell lines and less toxic against CAR T cells: slightly increased killing of tumor cells with combination<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"6\"><b>ATFmmp14: <\/b>Amino terminal fragment (ATF) of uPA fused with MMP14 catalytic domain<b>; PD1Y: <\/b>PD1 peptide mimetic that binds to and inhibit PD-L1&nbsp; <b>HANP:<\/b> Hyaluronic acid nanoparticle<b>; IONP: <\/b>Iron oxide nanoparticle<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>Table 1.

Drug delivery mechanisms better able to target the disease site and provide localized, sustained drug release have the potential to transform therapeutic standards. PODS crystals (PCs) are natural-mimetic, micron-scale protein co-crystals engineered to incorporate a protein cargo that is sustainably released under the action of resident proteases. PCs are efficiently taken up by phagocytic cells and their cargo protein is subsequently released in a bioactive form. Since blood-circulating phagocytic cells, including monocytes, are actively recruited into the tumor microenvironment, we postulated that monocyte\/macrophage-mediated PC delivery could be used as a molecular &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; to efficiently deliver therapeutic proteins to target cells. This could improve the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of protein drug delivery to treat systemic and disseminated diseases. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is notoriously toxic at the high doses required for therapeutic efficacy. Here, we demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of low doses of PC-IL-2 administered intravenously in a mouse model of melanoma. We further demonstrate the therapeutic benefit of PCs delivering low doses of IL-2, interleukin-15 (IL-15) and interferon-gamma (IFN-&#947;) in a mouse model of renal cell carcinoma. In all the treated mice, cachexia, a side effect of high-dose cytokine therapy, was notably absent. This study provides proof-of-concept for the utility of intravenously administered PCs to provide a generalised and widely applicable mechanism to effectively deliver protein drugs for the therapy of cancer and other diseases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Immunotherapy,Macrophages,Drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Michael H.

Nearly 50% of NAC-treated TNBC patients harboring residual disease display mutations in the phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase\/ mechanistic target of rapamycin (PI3K\/mTOR) pathway, correlating PI3K\/mTOR with chemoresistance. The protein kinase mTOR functions within two distinct protein complexes&#8212;mTORC1 and mTORC2. Inhibition of mTORC1 is ineffective in TNBCs. However, less is known regarding mTORC2 as a TNBC drug target, though mTORC2 is known to regulate tumor cell survival and motility\/metastasis in other cancers. Here, we leverage siRNA technology to block expression of the mTORC2 obligate cofactor, Rictor, to test the hypothesis that selective mTORC2 inhibition will improve TNBC response to chemotherapy.<br \/>siRNA-carrying nanoparticle complexes (si-NPs) continue to face systemic siRNA delivery challenges such as limited stability, off-target toxicities, and suboptimal tumor accumulation. Most conventional si-NPs are designed as &#8220;binary&#8221; systems comprising the siRNA cargo and the polymeric carrier that encapsulates it. Ternary si-NPs containing siRNA, an NP core-forming polymer (50B), and an NP surface-forming polymer (20kPEG-50B) have the potential to improve tumor silencing activity because of the participation of both polymers in siRNA encapsulation and endosome disruptive activity. Through concomitant structure-function optimization of 50B core polymer ratio (50B:20kPEG-50B) and molecular weight, we identified multiple lead ternary si-NPs with potent gene silencing activity, enhanced siRNA loading stability, and minimal toxicity. Following intravenous (i.v) treatment in vivo, all lead ternary si-NPs displayed increased circulation half-life, tumor uptake, and tumor gene silencing relative to the more canonical binary si-NPs. Critically, a single 1 mg\/kg i.v. injection of our optimized formulation, 50B8-DP100 si-NPs, resulted in 80% tumor Rictor knockdown in orthotopic MDA-MB-231 tumors in mice.<br \/>Therapeutic efficacy of 50B8-DP100 si-NPs, harboring siRNA against Rictor (siRictor-NPs) was then tested in models of TNBC. siRictor-NPs decreased cell growth and enhanced apoptosis in multiple TNBC cell lines. In an orthotopic HCC70 TNBC model, i.v. treatment with siRictor-NPs revealed substantial inhibition of mTORC2 activity in tumors by western analysis. siRictor-NP treatment also inhibited tumor growth to 52% relative to siControl-NP treatment. Preliminary in vitro studies further indicate that combining chemotherapy with siRictor-NPs improves TNBC cell killing over chemotherapy alone. Together, this work provides strong evidence for the therapeutic potential of Rictor knockdown and identifies a novel nanotechnology for the treatment of PI3K-active TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,siRNA,mTOR,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shrusti  S.

It lacks expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Compared to other types of BC, it is more aggressive and has higher risks of recurrence. In the metastatic setting, survival outcomes are much worse than other BC subtypes, with a 5-years survival rate of 8-16%. There is an urgent need to develop better treatment options for TNBC patients. We have developed a novel therapeutic, QN-247, by conjugating an anti-proliferative DNA aptamer to gold nanospheres. The aptamer-gold nanosphere construct shows increased half-life and cytotoxic effects relative to the aptamer alone. QN-247 inhibits nucleolin, a key regulatory protein overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, thereby reducing their proliferation.<br \/>Description of Experimental Procedures: A subcutaneous, TNBC model (MDA-MB-231 xenograft) in nude mice was used in this efficacy study. When tumor volumes reached sufficient size (85 mm<sup>3<\/sup>), QN-247 test compound, aptamer alone, and vehicle control was administered daily (QD) at 1 mg\/kg via intraperitoneal injection for 12 days.

Clinically, MpBCs exhibit the most dismal prognosis of all BC subtypes, with a median survival rate of 8 months in patients with metastatic disease. The main therapeutic option for MpBC remains standard chemotherapy, despite known resistance to most cytotoxic drugs. We recently reported that ~40% of MpBC patient samples display a gain-of-function oncogenic mutation (A14V) in ribosomal protein RPL39, which is responsible for treatment resistance, cancer stem cell self-renewal, and lung metastases. We also showed that high RPL39 levels were associated with worse survival in patients with MpBC. Collectively, these findings support the rationale of targeting this ubiquitous genetic marker in MpBC. This study was aimed to design an innovative targeted therapy against RPL39 by combining a small interfering RNA (siRNA) strategy (siRPL39) with biomimetic lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology for in vivo delivery to MpBC cells. These LNPs referred to as &#8220;leukosomes&#8221; incorporate membrane proteins from circulating leukocytes to facilitate evasion of immune clearance, enhance tropism towards inflamed endothelium such as the tumor-associated one, and improve siRNA internalization into the tumor mass. For leukosomes synthesis, we adapted a microfluidic device to incorporate membrane proteins from leukocytes within lipid bilayers. This technique retained all the physical and biological features of leukosomes, combined with high siRNA loading efficiency. We evaluated in vitro uptake and efficacy of siRPL39-loaded leukosomes in MpBC cell lines. We found that fluorescently labeled siRPL39 was rapidly internalized by leukosomes into MpBC cells demonstrating efficient and uniform uptake without inducing cytotoxicity. Treatment of MpBC cells with siRPL39-loaded leukosomes exhibited significantly knockdown of RPL39 mRNA, further supporting that the observed siRNA internalization results in potent and specific gene silencing. Notably, siRPL39-loaded leukosomes inhibited in vitro cell proliferation as compared with control siRNA leukosomes, indicating a key role of RPL39 in MpBC growth.

Given these goals, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), which delivers highly cytotoxic payloads to tumor tissue specifically, is one of the most favorable treatments. ADC is a growing drug delivery technology, with twelve FDA-approved ADCs as of 2022. Most of ADCs in use today target particular molecules for hematologic malignancies. ADCs for solid tumors are relatively in the early stages of development due to the lack of well-defined solid tumor-specific target molecules. To put it another way, the market has an enormous unmet demand for solid cancer-specific ADCs. As seen by recently approved ADCs and ADCs in clinical trials, finding novel targets for solid cancer has drawn a lot of attention in current development trends. Doppel, a prion-like protein, is transiently expressed in the neonatal brain endothelium; in adults, it is exclusively present in testicular cells. In our previous study, we found that Doppel is specifically expressed only in tumor tissues and tumor blood vessels, but not in normal adult tissues; its expression promoted cancerous blood vessel formation. Then, we generated several monoclonal antibodies which target Doppel; the most effective clone was selected. We observed that angiogenesis-related factors were suppressed in the tumor endothelial cells treated with the Doppel-targeting antibody. In addition, we injected the antibody into mouse models and visualized the tumor-targeting efficacy using in vivo imaging system (IVIS); the antibody accumulates in the tumor significantly higher compared to non-targeting IgG. We suggest what we believe to be a novel strategy to target a molecular marker that is altered and overexpressed specifically in tumor tissues and tumor endothelial cells. Based on the above discoveries, we have developed the Doppel-targeting ADC; this drug, according to our hypothesis, will target only cancer cells that express Doppel and result in apoptotic cell death. The ADC has demonstrated remarkable anticancer efficacy in both cell and mouse models, although it is still in the early stages of research. We believe that the enhanced specificity for targeting tumors, the high tumor-to-organ ratio, and the bystander killing effect would make this Doppel-targeting ADC a successful &#8220;solid cancer-specific&#8221; one.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Antitumor agents,Bystander effect,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ha Kyeong Lee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Byoungmo Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Seho Kweon<sup>1<\/sup>, Jeong Uk Choi<sup>2<\/sup>, Sang Yoon Kim<sup>3<\/sup>, Youngro Byun<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Seoul National University, Gwanak-gu, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Songpa-gu, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a2c83325-496c-4da5-9244-1fa46a0a6c82","ControlNumber":"4141","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

A panel of eight patient-derived primary GSCs lines have been screened for their sensitivity to a small kinase MEK inhibitor (MEKi) with AnnexinV\/PI staining. Among these, five display a sensitive phenotype with at least 50% reduction on cell viability after 72 hours of treatment. Then, four cell lines, two MEKi-sensitive (ICH001 and ICH003) and two MEKi-resistant (ICH013 and ICH027) were selected for a deeper molecular characterization based on MGMT methylation status, mesenchymal index and main hotspot mutations associated with GBM pathology MEKi incubation on GSC caused a prompt phospho-ERK reduction already after 3 hours. Of note, we report a concomitant activation of AKT and downstream molecules pointing to an ERK-mTOR redundant activity. To this end, we combined MEKi to PI3K\/akt\/mTOR inhibitor and we observed an increased cell death even in GSCs displaying moderate sensitivity to MEKi as single-agent (MEKi: 90% vs MEKi-PI3K\/akt\/mTOR inhibitor: 30% cell viability). Then, MEKi ability to cross the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) and target GBM cells was investigated using a transwell BBB in vitro model. The PI3K\/akt\/mTOR pathway inhibitor, known from the literature to readily cross the BBB, was included as positive control. Obtained results showed MEKi inability to efficiently cross the BBB, thus limiting its utility as GBM therapy. These results suggest the need for a specific drug delivery strategy in the brain that might be therapeutically effective. Recently our laboratory has provided proof-of-concept of a combination strategy based on radiation and adjuvant drug-loaded liposomes (LPs) conjugated with a modified Apolipoprotein E-derived peptide (mApoE), known to facilitate BBB crossing. To strengthen therapeutic efficacy and to lower off-target effects, we implemented mApoE-LPs with a matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 sensitive lipopeptide (M2-9SLP) that allows controlled payload release only in the tumor microenvironment rich in MMPs. To this end, MEKi was encapsulated into the M2-9SLP\/mApoE-LPs, and its capacity to promote cell death was evaluated. M2-9SLP\/mApoE-MEKi-LPs caused in all the sensitive cell lines GSCs proliferation inhibition and induction of apoptosis upon 72h in vitro treatment indicating that the encapsulation process did not alter drug efficacy. In conclusion, our in vitro results support MEKi encapsulation into M2P\/mApoE-LP as nanotherapeutic strategy that could guarantee specific delivery of MEKi in a MMP2-enriched tumor microenvironment without altering its capacity to inhibit GSC proliferation and survival.<br \/>Funding by FRRB grant NEVERMIND (CP2_16\/2018)","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,MEK inhibitor,Drug delivery,Blood-brain barrier,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Milena Mattioli<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Elisabetta Stanzani<sup>1<\/sup>, Valentino Ribecco<sup>1<\/sup>, Marco Pizzocri<sup>1<\/sup>, Eliana Lauranzano<sup>1<\/sup>, Margherita Maria Ravanelli<sup>1<\/sup>, Simone Olei<sup>2<\/sup>, Maria Pia Tropeano<sup>2<\/sup>, Pierfausto Seneci<sup>3<\/sup>, Francesca Re<sup>4<\/sup>, Federico Pessina<sup>2<\/sup>, Michela Matteoli<sup>1<\/sup>, Lorena Passoni<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Laboratory of Pathology and Brain Pathology, IRCCS Istituto Clinico Humanitas, Milano, Italy,<sup>2<\/sup>Neurosurgery Unit, IRCCS Istituto Clinico Humanitas, Milano, Italy,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Chemestry, University of Milan, Milano, Italy,<sup>4<\/sup>School of Medicine and Surgery, Nanomedicine Center NANOMIB, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7f1fc7cc-39d7-4b44-981c-513ed063b36e","ControlNumber":"4539","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Median survival is ~15 months after diagnosis. Therapies to effectively manage glioblastoma are hindered due to the presence of the blood-tumor barrier (BTB). Indirubins are 3,2&#8217;-bisindole compounds of the Indigo naturalis used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat proliferative diseases. Herein, we demonstrate that systemic delivery of 6-bromoindirubin-3&#8217;-acetoxime (BIA), an indirubin derivative, increases cisplatin delivery to GBM tumors through alteration of the BTB integrity and synergy of BIA with platinum therapeutics to potentiate anti-tumor killing.<br \/>Methods: Pre-clinical studies involved G9-pCDH glioblastoma cell line implantation in na&#239;ve nude mice. Cisplatin uptake 24 hours after BIA tail-vein administration into healthy brain and GBM murine tumors was assessed via inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). DNA-damage was assessed by &#947;H2AX immunofluorescence. BIA combination with cisplatin in vitro studies were performed via luminescent viability assays. Treatment of human cerebrovascular endothelial cells (HCMEC\/D3) with BIA for BBB studies in vitro involved trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurement, transcriptome analysis, VE-cadherin western blotting and immunofluorescence.<br \/>Results: Combined addition of cisplatin and BIA showed enhanced anti-GBM killing effects than cisplatin alone in G9-pCDH (IC<sub>50<\/sub> cisplatin=1, BIA+cisplatin=0.2), G34-pCDH (IC<sub>50<\/sub> cisplatin=3, BIA+cisplatin=1.7) and G30-LRP (IC<sub>50<\/sub> cisplatin=1, BIA+cisplatin=0.3) lines. Efficacy studies using the G9-pCDH xenograft murine model showed extended survival when using cisplatin in combination with BIA (median 27d, p=0.0016) when compared to cisplatin (18.5d), BIA (21.5d) and control (18d). Increased intra-tumoral accumulation of cisplatin was observed when used in combination with BIA (mean 100 pg\/mg, p=0.012) rather than cisplatin alone (5 pg\/mg). No increased platinum uptake was seen in healthy brain tissue under any conditions. &#947;H2AX foci in tumor were more frequent in the BIA and cisplatin combination arm (p=0.0086) than each single agent and control groups. Evaluation of HCMEC\/D3 cells treated with BIA showed a decrease in TEER levels (p&#60;0.001) and transcriptomic dysregulation of members of the WNT pathway and downregulation of VE-cadherin (~4-fold). BIA exerted cytoskeleton changes in HCMEC\/D3 cells and decreased VE-cadherin expression at the protein level and its distribution on cellular surface, suggesting loss of adherens junctions as a potential mechanism for BIA-induced permeability of the BTB.<br \/>Conclusion: Overall, our data support the applicability of BIA for modulating the BTB permeability and increasing intra-tumoral drug accumulation for improving GBM therapeutic efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage,Cisplatin,Glioblastoma,Blood-brain barrier,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jorge  L.

Development of small molecule Myc drugs has been hampered due to the lack of suitable binding pockets. Myc inhibitory peptides H1, derived from the bHLH-LZ region, have been explored to address this. However, poor pharmacokinetic profiles have precluded clinical translation.&#8239;Here, we use a novel modular platform technology referred to as the HYDRAC&#8239;for the development of dual-functional Myc inhibitors\/degraders.<br \/>Methods: HYDRACs were generated using ROMP resulting in dense brush polymers where peptides occupy every side chain. Heterofunctional constructs were designed incorporating synergistic secondary sequences in addition to Myc-targeting H1. Specifically, a RRRG degron sequence was added to engage endogenous cellular machinery for targeted Myc degradation. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy were used to assess cellular penetration; cellular viability assays coupled with both cellular (isogenic pairs, Myc-dependent and independent lines) and biochemical (scrambled H1, monomeric peptides, etc) controls were used to assess anti-proliferative and Myc-specific responses. Myc engagement was assessed via biophysical assays and protein degradation monitored by Western blot. A CRISPR E3 ligase knockdown library&#8239;and mass spec was used to identify&#8239;pathways responsible for HYDRAC-induced protein degradation.<br \/>Results: A library of HYDRACs with low PDI and predetermined DPs were generated. These compounds were shown to be cell-penetrating with antiproliferative effects at sub-micromolar IC50 values in a formulation- and Myc-dependent manner. HYDRAC treatment resulted in significant decreases in Myc protein levels, rescued by proteasomal inhibition with MG132. RNAseq showed selective overexpression of Myc pathway genes. Biophysical analysis showed strong HYDRAC-Myc interactions, in addtion to Myc protein present following pull-down of biotin-terminated HYDRACs. Selectivity studies revealed that HYDRAC activity requires an intact H1 targeting sequence. Identification of E3 ligases implicated in the degradation pathway are ongoing. Mice bearing transplanted Myc-CaP tumors showed delayed tumor growth following IP administration of&#8239;Myc-degrading HYDRACs, with studies exploring the biodistribution and pharmacokinetic profile of the compound ongoing.<br \/>Conclusion: We present a novel platform technology that addresses the challenges inherent to peptide delivery approaches. The presented work demonstrates the feasibility of HYDRACs for targeted Myc inhibition and degradation. This&#8239;first-in-class compound also opens the door for the development of HYDRACs targeting other proteins of interest and multiplexing different E3 ligase recruiters for tissue or disease-specific activity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myc,Chemistry,Drug design,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Max  M.

Specifically, advances in antigen targeting of CD20 and CD19 with CAR T cell therapy has increased overall survival of this patient population and has influenced to expand T cell repertoire to novel antigen targets. However, limitations to these cell-based therapies are the lack of development against solid tumor antigens, partly due to the paucity of antigen candidates that are sufficiently specific to epithelial cancers. Therefore, technologies that can mark tumor cells for immune recognition could prove beneficial in the treatment of these solid cancers. This project aims to artificially deliver an antigen to tumor cells by harnessing a universal property of tumors: acidic microenvironment. The pH low insertion peptide (pHLIP) is a technology that targets solid tumors based on the low pH produced by the Warburg effect. pHLIP-conjugates have undergone extensive development for drug delivery, with one notable candidate CBX12 entering phase I clinical trials in 2021. Our system uses a pHLIP-conjugated SIINFEKL peptide (derived from ovalbumin) to serve as our model antigen system, with SIINFEKL-targeting T cells (OT1) that can be used as a tool to investigate antigen delivery, recognition, and functionality. We have observed through immunofluorescence that B16 F10 mouse melanoma cells treated <i>in vitro<\/i> with the 1uM pHLIP-SIINFEKL construct under acidic conditions can recruit OT1 cells and induce a T cell synapse. Preliminary in vivo experiments in C57BL\/6-Tg OT1 mice bearing B16 F10 flank tumors showed that treatment with pHLIP-SIINFEKL by intravenous administration led to a suppression of tumor growth compared to controls, with approximately 50% smaller fold change in tumor volume. Cumulatively, these initial results suggest that pHLIP-SIINFEKL can be delivered to tumors to recruit OT1 cells to engage in antigen recognition and lead to efficacy in tumor growth delay <i>in vivo<\/i>. This technology has the capability to provide a novel approach to decorate solid tumors with engineered antigens for enhanced immune recognition and anti-tumor efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor antigen,Targeted drug delivery,Tumor targeting,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Annali  M.

Androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSIs) are standard-of-care therapies for advanced PCa and can prolong patient survival by months. Treatment-na&#239;ve PCa harbors a population of stem-like cells (AR<sup>-\/lo<\/sup>) functionally defined as PCa stem cells (PCSCs). During cancer progression or upon therapeutic treatment, non-CSCs may undergo cellular plasticity and be reprogrammed to PCSCs. As a result, PCSCs may become the predominant cell population in advanced (Gleason 9\/10) and ARSI-resistant tumors, and the &#8220;root cause&#8221; for drug resistance. However, current ARSI-based treatment regimens primarily target AR<sup>+<\/sup> CRPC cells or clones but largely ignore AR<sup>-\/lo<\/sup> cells. microRNA-34a (miR-34a), a tumor-suppressive miRNA dysregulated in PCa, is a potent PCSC inhibitor by targeting cellular processes essential for CSC survival and functions. Here we aim to develop novel miR-34a therapeutics to target PCa cell heterogeneity and CRPC. miR-34a expression negatively correlates with the tumor stage in PCa samples. And miR-34a expression is significantly reduced in p53 mutated tumors. We explored two novel miR-34a delivery platforms. The first is packaging-free ligand-mediated conjugate utilizing 2- [3-(1,3-dicarboxy propyl) ureido] pentanedioic acid (DUPA) as a high-affinity binding ligand for prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), which is upregulated in PCa. The second platform uses cationic lipid nanoparticles to package miR-34a (LNP-miR-34a). We show that during PCa progression and upon treatment, PSMA expression is upregulated and continues to be highly expressed in CRPC and PSMA expression level negatively correlates with overall survival in PCa. Moreover, DUPA-conjugate can specifically target PSMA-expressing PCa both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. DUPA-miR-34a significantly induces target gene silencing <i>in vitro<\/i>. On the other hand, LNP show good encapsulation efficiency for miR-34a, LNP-miR-34a significantly repressed cell proliferation by downregulating critical stemness factors in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, we are pursuing chemical modifications of the miR-34a mimics aiming to improve serum stability and future in vivo applications. Both fully modified miR-34a (FM-miR-34a) and partially-modified-miR-34a (PM-miR-34a) exhibit improved serum stability without compromising the functionality. Our data suggest that DUPA-miR-34a represents a promising novel therapeutic for PCSC-enriched CRPC that continue to express PSMA, whereas LNP-miR-34a could be a systemic therapeutic for CRPC treatment in the combinatorial setting. miR-34a, as a direct target and a major mediator of p53 functions, may represent an effective replacement therapeutic in p53-mutated advanced PCa.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,miR-34a,Castration-resistant prostate cancer,Cancer cell heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Wen (Jess) Li<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaozhuo Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Ahmed  M.

This has inspired the successful development of many small molecule inhibitors of BRAF and MEK. However, development of RAS small molecule inhibitors has not been successful in large part due to the lack of a sufficiently large and deep hydrophobic pocket in RAS proteins to allow for small molecule binding. Notably, in this regard, many bacterial pathogens have evolved potent protein toxins to disrupt the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway. Fortunately, these naturally designed potent toxins, such as anthrax toxin, Fortunately, these potent, naturally designed toxins, such as anthrax toxin and DUF5, can be structurally modified to achieve high tumor specificity. DUF5 (amino acids Glu<sup>3581<\/sup>-Gln<sup>4089<\/sup>) is a toxin effector domain of MARTX (a multifunctional-autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin) from <i>Vibrio vulnificus<\/i>. DUF5 was recently identified to be a specific and potent endopeptidase that cleaves and inactivates RAS. To address the above critical unmet medical needs, in this work, we have generated an anthrax toxin\/DUF5-based, highly tumor-selective RAS inactivator and evaluated its anti-tumor activity in a variety of tumor models. This tumor-selective RAS inactivator can specifically bind to the major anthrax toxin receptor CMG2 on tumor cells and tumor stromal cells, and strictly relies on the simultaneous presence of two distinct tumor-associated proteases, MMPs and urokinase, to gain entry into tumor cells and tumor stromal cells to proteolytically inactivate RAS signaling, achieving potent selective targeting. Our data show that our tumor-selective RAS inactivator displays potent cytotoxicity to cancer cells whose survival depends on oncogenic RAS signaling. Our engineered toxin displayed potent in vivo antitumor activity to a range of tumors with oncogenic RAS mutations in syngeneic and human xenograft mouse tumor models. Therefore, we have developed a tumor-selective, safe, and highly potent RAS inactivator that has high potential for targeting tumors with oncogenic RAS mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Antitumor activity,Targeted therapy,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shihui Liu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Zehua Zuo<sup><\/sup>, Jie Liu<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"064c622e-c1e9-4f2e-ab6f-31c628eeef9f","ControlNumber":"3682","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

The available conventional treatment options have limited efficacy in ER<sup>+<\/sup> breast cancer. Simultaneous targeting and inhibition of multiple pathways in ER<sup>+<\/sup> cancer may result in effective therapeutic outcomes. However, combining two or more drugs to treat cancer leads to unsynchronized pharmacokinetics, toxicity and eventual development of drug resistance. To overcome these limitations, a novel nano-formulation of PI3-K&#948;\/HDAC6 dual inhibitor in combination with Navitoclax (NAV; BCL-2 and BCL-xL inhibitor) is developed using Pluronic modified PLA based hybrid block copolymers (Quatramers<sup>TM<\/sup>). The prepared dual drug loaded PI3-K&#948;\/HDAC6-NAV-Quatramers have shown high encapsulation efficiency, optimum size and polydispersity index (PDI) of ~93%, 159 &#177; 2.6 nm and 0.13 &#177; 0.05, respectively. These PI3-K&#948;\/HDAC6-NAV-Quatramers exhibit slow and sustained release profile of PI3-K&#948;\/HDAC6 and NAV in a non-physiological buffer (PBS, pH 7.4). Multiple ratios (PI3-K&#948;\/HDAC6:NAV = 3:1, 1:1, 1:3) were encapsulated to generate diverse dual drug-loaded Quatramers. The in-vitro proliferation inhibition studies conducted with PI3-K&#948;\/HDAC6-NAV-Quatramers on ER<sup>+<\/sup> breast cancer cell lines have shown synergistic effect with substantially lower IC<sub>50<\/sub> values as compared to individual PI3-K&#948;\/HDAC6-Quatramers and NAV-Quatramers. The results also demonstrate that, in contrast to 1:1 and 3:1, treatment of ER+ breast cancer cells with 1:3 ratio of PI3-K&#948;\/HDAC6:NAV dual drug-loaded Quatramenrs, was associated with substantial inhibition of growth in vitro. The efficacy of PI3-K&#948;\/HDAC6-NAV-Quatramers was assessed in ER<sup>+<\/sup> breast cancer syngeneic mouse tumor model (EAC). Mice were treated either with PI3-K&#948;\/HDAC6-Quatramers, NAV-Quatramers or PI3-K&#948;\/HDAC6-NAV-dual drug loaded Quatramers at 4 mg\/kg, i.v, twice a week for 3 weeks. Interestingly, in contrast to PI3-K&#948;\/HDAC6-Quatramers or NAV-Quatramers alone, the results demonstrate that there was nearly a complete tumor growth inhibition when mice were treated with PI3-K&#948;\/HDAC6-NAV-Quatramers. Additionally, the treatment with PI3-K&#948;\/HDAC6-NAV-Quatramers at the efficacious dose of 4 mg\/kg did not show any significant body weight loss, confirming no overt toxicity. Taken together, these results demonstrate that a unique formulation of a novel PI3-K&#948;\/HDAC6 dual inhibitor in combination with Navitoclax in a dual drug-loaded Quatramers in a particular ratio of 1:3, represents an excellent strategy for efficient treatment option for ER<sup>+<\/sup> breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Breast cancer,PI3K,HDAC inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Surender M.

TAMs that express an M2-like phenotype promote tumor growth and create an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). High levels of M2-like TAMs correlate with a poor prognosis. However, macrophages display phenotypic plasticity and can be repolarized from one phenotype to another through signaling molecules, such as cytokines. Macrophages that express an M1-like phenotype are inflammatory and can induce anti-tumor immunity. Administration of pro-inflammatory cytokines reprogram M2 TAMs toward an M1-like phenotype that can reduce tumor growth and stimulate an inflammatory response within the TME. However, systemic delivery of these inflammatory cytokines generates toxic, dose-limiting off target effects. This work seeks to develop a localized delivery approach that enables TAM polarization toward M1 programs while abrogating systemic toxicities. We have developed an injectable alginate cryogel (hydrogel fabricated at -20<sup>o<\/sup>C) to act as localized delivery depot for inflammatory cytokines and macrophage-specific chemokines to repolarize TAMs. To delay the release of our chemoattractant relative to our repolarizing cytokines, we are developing a second generation cryogel, loaded with free chemokines and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles encapsulated with cytokines to delay their release. With our first generation cryogel (without nanoparticles), we used qRT-PCR, flow cytometry, Luminex panels, and single cell RNAseq to characterize the impact of treatment. For <i>in vitro<\/i> studies, bone marrow derived macrophages were extracted from FVB mice, while TAMs and tumor explants were extracted from the spontaneous mammary tumors of PyMT mice. It was found that our cryogel significantly increased M1 markers and decreased M2 markers in all three <i>in vitro<\/i> models.Peritumoral injection of the cryogel system into FVB female mice with orthotopic mammary tumors resulted in significantly suppressed tumor growth, an increase in T cell infiltration, and an increase in the M1:M2 ratio of TAMs. This activated immune response and elevated presence of T cells suggests that localized chemokine\/cytokine treatment &#8216;primes&#8217; the TME, potentially making it more susceptible to immunotherapies that rely on T cells, such as immune checkpoint blockade.We have concluded that our first-generation gel demonstrates the potential of priming the TME to slow tumor growth. Characterization of our second generation, nano-in-cryogel system is currently underway. Based on mathematical modeling, we hypothesize that the nano-in-cryogel will induce a more pronounced repolarization effect by allowing the chemoattractant to induce M2 TAM migration prior to the release of the inflammatory, reprogramming cytokines from the PLGA nanoparticles.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,Immunotherapy,Cytokines,Drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sydney Ros Henriques<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ori  Z.

Yet immune-related side effects remain a major hurdle to extending its label to many more types of cancer. Intra- and peritumoral administration of aCTLA-4 has recently emerged as a means to optimize its dose\/efficacy ratio while preventing its off-target, systemic toxicities. Sustained peritumoral delivery of low-dose aCTLA-4 by genetically engineered encapsulated cells could offer a promising option for cancer treatment addressing the shortcomings of systemic therapy.<br \/>Material and Methods: The efficacy of sustained, low-dose aCTLA-4 delivered by genetically engineered encapsulated cells was assessed in human CTLA4 knock-in mice subcutaneously engrafted with MC38 colon adenocarcinoma cells. In a therapeutic model, mice were treated with either encapsulated human myoblast cells secreting aCTLA-4 (MVX-3) in the vicinity of the tumor, or i.p. injections of Ipilimumab (10mg\/kg BIW x 4). Encapsulated wild-type cells (WT) and PBS were used as respective controls. A subgroup of mice was terminated at day 7 post-treatment for early pharmacological characterization. Tumor size and survival were measured to evaluate the efficacy. Secretion of aCTLA-4 by MVX-3 and aCTLA-4 titer in plasma was quantified by ELISA. Tumors, spleens, and draining lymph nodes were collected for flow cytometry analyses.<br \/>Results: Peritumoral administration of MVX-3 induced durable complete tumor rejection (2\/7) and tumor growth control (4\/7) when administered at doses 1&#8217;000 times lower than i.p ipilimumab, whereas rapid tumor growth without any tumor rejection was observed in mice treated with control vehicles. I.p. ipilimumab induced durable complete tumor rejection (9\/12), while treatment-related toxicities upon dosing led to premature mice termination (3\/12). MVX-3 was found as equally effective as i.p. ipilimumab in decreasing the proportion of CTLA4+ helper and regulatory T cells in the tumor at Day 7 post-treatment. Survival was also improved by MVX-3 compared to control vehicles.<br \/>Conclusions: These findings suggest that sustained delivery of low-dose aCTLA-4 by genetically engineered encapsulated cells to the tumor microenvironment could achieve similar therapeutic benefits as systemic therapy, without the commonly associated toxicities. The safety and biological efficacy profile of MVX-3 encourage further preclinical and clinical explorations.<u><\/u>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-07 Novel drug delivery systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Anticancer therapy,peritumoral,Ipilimumab,Drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Julien Grogg<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Emily Charrier<sup>1<\/sup>, Remi Vernet<sup>2<\/sup>, Muriel Urwyler<sup>1<\/sup>, Olivier Von Rohr<sup>2<\/sup>, Valentin Saingier<sup>2<\/sup>, Fabien Courtout<sup>2<\/sup>, Aurelien Lathuiliere<sup>1<\/sup>, Adrien Engel<sup>3<\/sup>, Nicolas Mach<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>UNIGE, Geneva, Switzerland,<sup>2<\/sup>HUG, Geneva, Switzerland,<sup>3<\/sup>MaxiVAX, Geneva, Switzerland,<sup>4<\/sup>HUG\/UNIGE, Geneva, Switzerland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b9e7403f-89e4-4b3b-a420-1dea855a7ea7","ControlNumber":"2016","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

In contrast to the use of antibodies for tumor homing, small molecule binding ligands may result in a better tumor penetration. Also the potential targets for ADCs are limited to internalizing antigens so the ADC can be trafficked to the lysosomes for release and activation of the payload. We sought new mechanisms for extracellular activation of SMDCs using enzymes, which are present in the tumor microenvironment (TME). For example, neutrophil elastase (NE) belongs to a family of serine proteases that degrades elastin and other extracellular matrix proteins. NE also contributes to cancer progression by enhancing tumor evasion and metastasis. NE expression and neutrophil tumor infiltration have been correlated with metastatic potential and poor prognosis. Previous studies have shown that NE efficiently cleaves and activates camptothecin conjugates by cleaving an ester bond<sup>1<\/sup>.<br \/>Here we describe the successful use of NE for efficient activation and traceless payload release from several unique and proprietary SMDCs. Binding molecules such as a peptidomimetic &#945;v&#946;3 ligand were linked via appropriate spacers to substrate tripeptides of NE. The C-terminal end was directly attached to different functional groups at various payloads such as camptothecins (CPT), monomethyl auristatin E, kinesin spindle protein inhibitors, and CDK9 inhibitors. Hindered ester bonds, amide bonds, and sulfoximide bonds were found to be efficiently cleaved by NE; conversely, those linkages were highly stable in culture medium and in circulation. Consequently, respective SMDCs are not or are moderately cytotoxic when incubated alone with cancer cell lines. However, in the presence of NE, cytotoxicity of the SMDCs increases by two orders of magnitude to the low nanomolar or subnanomolar range across several cell lines reaching similar potency as the respective payloads alone. In PK studies in mouse, rat, and dog, the SMDC with a CPT payload, shows a half-life of 3.6, 8.3, and 4.2 h, respectively, and excellent stability in circulation over 24 hr with low exposure levels (&#60;1% of SMDC) of cleaved payload detectable. In an MX1 triple-negative breast cancer xenograft model, tumor regressions were observed when the SMDC was administered in a 2 days on\/5 days off schedule.<br \/>NE is capable of cleaving sterically hindered ester bonds, amides, and sulfoximides to release a variety of potent payloads from different SMDCs in a traceless manner. These molecules represents a versatile strategy for selective delivery of payloads to TME that does not require the tumor target to internalize. <sup><br \/><\/sup><sup>1<\/sup>Lerchen HG, Stelte-Ludwig B, Kopitz C, et al.

Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are electrical fields that disrupt cellular processes critical for cancer cell viability and tumor progression, ultimately leading to cell death. In several tumor types, the mechanism of action of TTFields included an antimitotic effect and DNA damage induction with impaired DNA damage repair. The current study aimed to examine the efficacy of TTFields for treating gastric cancer cells, and the potential application of TTFields concomitant with FOLFOX.<br \/>Methods: Human gastric cancer cell lines, AGS and KATO III, were treated with TTFields (intensity of 1.1 and 1.7 V\/cm, respectively; frequency of 150 kHz) using the inovitro system. Cell count and colony formation were examined following treatment, and the overall effect calculated by multiplication of the two. RNA sequencing was also performed on samples from control and TTFields-treated cells. Mitotic spindle defects, chromosome miss-localization, and DNA double strand breaks (DSB) formation were examined by fluorescent staining for &#945;-tubulin, phospho-histone 3 (PH3), and phospho-histone H2AX (&#947;H2AX), respectively. Expression of DNA repair proteins was measured using Western Blot. The impact of TTFields with FOLFOX and its individual therapeutic components, oxaliplatin and 5-FU on cell count and clonogenicity was tested.<br \/>Results: TTFields reduced cell count and the colony forming ability of the cells. Cells treated with TTFields displayed abnormal mitotic figures and increased levels of DNA damage. Expression of DNA repair proteins was downregulated following treatment with TTFields, as evident from RNA and protein levels. Furthermore, TTFields augmented the cytotoxic and clonogenic effects of FOLFOX and its individual therapeutic components, oxaliplatin and 5-FU.<br \/>Conclusions: TTFields show potential as an effective gastric cancer treatment, with a mechanism of action involving an anti-mitotic effect and DNA damage repair impairment. TTFields may be applied to enhance the efficacy of gastric cancer standard-of-care.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-03 Combination chemotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Oxaliplatin,Fluorouracil ,TTFields,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Naama Flint-Brodsly<sup><\/sup>, Einav Zeevi<sup><\/sup>, Kerem Wainer-Katsir<sup><\/sup>, Hila Fishman<sup><\/sup>, Antonia Martinez-Conde<sup><\/sup>, <b>Eyal Dor-On<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Mijal Munster<sup><\/sup>, Yaara Porat<sup><\/sup>, Tali Voloshin<sup><\/sup>, Shiri Davidi<sup><\/sup>, Adi Haber<sup><\/sup>, Moshe Giladi<sup><\/sup>, Uri Weinberg<sup><\/sup>, Yoram Palti<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Novocure Ltd, Haifa, Israel","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3129afc9-0873-43c7-b6fe-985f27d6ac71","ControlNumber":"1810","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;N.
