[{"Abstract":"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) were the first clinically approved drugs designed to exploit synthetic lethality. Despite initial responses, patients harboring homologous recombination (HR) alterations that receive PARPi develop treatment resistance, which has generated a need for additional therapies targeting homologous recombination deficient (HRD) tumors. Poly (ADP-Ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) plays a key role in the resolution of PARP1\/2-dependent DNA damage repair through hydrolysis of Poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) chains and consequent release of DNA repair protein complexes from chromatin. In culture, the accumulation of PAR chains in the absence of a functional PARG enzyme causes delayed repair of DNA breaks resulting in increased sensitivity to alkylating agents and ionizing radiation. Notably, some HRD cell models have shown differential sensitivity to PARGi vs PARPi, suggesting that PARGi may overcome some PARPi resistance mechanisms. The ability of PARGi to exacerbate replication deficiencies nominates it as a potential therapeutic target for a broad range of cancer types with genomic instability. IDE161 is an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of PARG. Biochemical and cellular assays demonstrate that IDE161 is a potent inhibitor of PAR chain hydrolysis and has anti-proliferative activity in breast and ovarian HRD cancer cell lines with both inherent and acquired PARPi resistance. IDE161 anti-proliferative effects were associated with induction of mitotic arrest and activation of the DNA damage response pathway, suggesting the position of PARG in the DNA repair cycle remains essential in the context of some PARPi resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, profiling of IDE161 across a panel of 264 molecularly characterized cancer cell lines indicated that PARGi may show benefit beyond HRD and in indications other than ovarian and breast. Nonclinical studies in cell line and patient derived xenograft models of breast, ovarian, and gastric tumor types harboring defects in the HR pathway demonstrated anti-tumor activity in response to IDE161. Consistent with <i>in vitro<\/i> findings, we observed IDE161 antitumor activity in PARPi resistant xenograft models. Moreover, studies in cell lines, tumors and tissues revealed that dose and time-dependent accumulation of PAR chains serves as a robust proximal pharmacodynamic biomarker indicative of PARG target engagement. IDE161 is a novel targeted therapy that exploits the synthetic lethal relationship between PARG and genomic instability, thus leading to selective anti-proliferative effects in tumors harboring defects in the HR pathway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARG,Genomic instability,PARP inhibitors,Synthetic lethality,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Monah Abed<sup><\/sup>, Diana Muñoz<sup><\/sup>, Vidya Seshadri<sup><\/sup>, Steve Federowicz<sup><\/sup>, Arjun  A.

We studied the development of PARPi and\/or platinum resistant disease using both tissue and a novel liquid biopsy assay, in patients treated for BRCA1\/2-mutated metastatic breast cancer (BRCA1\/2m mBC).<br \/><i>Approach<\/i>: A cohort of 35 mBC patients with germline or somatic <i>BRCA1<\/i>\/<i>2<\/i> mutations were identified as having developed PARPi or platinum resistant disease. Tumour biopsies were analysed by exome and transcriptome sequencing whereas ctDNA isolated from plasma sampled across the pre-treatment, response and eventual progression journey were analysed using the Guardant INFINITY platform equipped to detect mutations in &#62;800 genes, and genome wide methylation, including promoter methylation in 398 cancer-related genes. Somatic mutations or regions of methylation that were associated with resistance were identified, including <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> reversion mutations. Somatic mutations with the potential to cause PARPi resistance were annotated using CRISPR screen data and other functional analyses describing genes that alter PARPi synthetic lethality.<br \/><i>Results<\/i>: The most common resistance mechanism was BRCA1\/2 reversion mutation (51%; n=8 <i>BRCA1<\/i>m patients<i>, n=<\/i>10 <i>BRCA2<\/i>m patients). Most reversions (77%) occurred via deletions (<i>BRCA1<\/i>, 70%; <i>BRCA2,<\/i> 79%) and exhibited microhomology use at junctions (&#62; 80% for both <i>BRCA1<\/i> and <i>BRCA2<\/i>). In 14 patients, multiple concurrent reversion mutations were detected with VAFs ranging from 0.1-40% for <i>BRCA1<\/i> and 0.05-18% for <i>BRCA2<\/i>. Changes in VAF over time indicated that different reversions in the same patient may impart different fitness advantages in the face of treatment. Loss-of-function mutations in the 53BP1-Shieldin pathway were identified in two <i>BRCA1<\/i>m patients, and VUS mutations in the pathway were seen in two further patients. In some patients, reversion mutations co-occurred with either 53BP1-Shieldin pathway mutations or with replication fork stability mutations (<i>PAXIP1<\/i> in <i>BRCA2<\/i>m patients) - indicating concurrent but mechanistically distinct forms of resistance develop in the same patient. We isolated a PDX model from one patient that exhibits resistance via both BRCA1 reversion and loss of 53BP1, allowing this phenomenon to be modelled in more detail. We also detected <i>BRCA1<\/i> methylation in ctDNA in a patient with a somatic rearrangement in <i>BRCA1<\/i>.<br \/><i>Conclusions<\/i>: Liquid biopsy profiling of PARPi-resistance breast cancer patients indicates that many patients develop multiple reversion mutations, and that alterations in the 53BP1-Shieldin pathway are present but less frequent. The co-occurrence of 53BP1-Shieldin pathway mutations and reversion mutations suggests parallel mechanisms of resistance can operate in the same patient.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Homologous recombination,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,PARP inhibitors,BRCA,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Elizabeth Harvey-Jones<sup>1<\/sup>, Maya Raghunandan<sup>1<\/sup>, Luisa Robbez-Masson<sup>1<\/sup>, Alaguthurai Thanussuyah<sup>2<\/sup>, Roberta Liccardo<sup>2<\/sup>, Arielle Yablonovitch<sup>3<\/sup>, Mingyang Cai<sup>3<\/sup>, Leylah Drusbosky<sup>3<\/sup>, Michael Dorschner<sup>3<\/sup>, Lorena Magraner Pardo<sup>1<\/sup>, Rebecca Marlow<sup>1<\/sup>, Asha Konde<sup>1<\/sup>, Jennifer Trendell<sup>2<\/sup>, John Alexander<sup>1<\/sup>, Syed Haider<sup>1<\/sup>, Chris Starling<sup>1<\/sup>, Ioannis Roxanis<sup>1<\/sup>, Jennifer Yen<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Stephen J.

Inherited pathogenic mutations in <i>BRCA2<\/i> are associated with a 38%-84% risk for breast cancer and a 16.5%-27% risk for ovarian cancer. <i>BRCA2<\/i> exon 3, which encodes a binding site for the interacting proteins EMSY and PALB2, is frequently skipped during alternative splicing events, often due to spliceogenic mutations, but also for as yet uncharacterized environmental conditions. A genomic deletion that results in complete allelic loss of exon 3 has been shown to be pathogenic, yet sequence variants that result in increased frequency of exon 3-skipping have been shown to be non-pathogenic. Thus, the allele-specific ability of <i>BRCA2<\/i> to contribute to DNA repair is affected by the level of exon 3-skipping. In this study we explore the effects of the topoisomerase inhibitor doxorubicin on the frequency of <i>BRCA2<\/i> exon 3-skipping. Isoform-specific end-point RT-PCR shows that doxorubicin increases the frequency of <i>BRCA2<\/i> exon 3-skipping in the breast cancer cell line MCF7 at concentrations below those required for promoting apoptosis.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> MCF7 cells were treated with doxorubicin according to standard protocols.

Isoform-specific RT-PCR primers were designed to amplify the full-length region surrounding <i>BRCA2<\/i> exon 3 independently from the region left by an exon-skipping event (&#8710;3). RT-PCR products were visualized using agarose gel electrophoresis.<br \/><b>Results and Conclusion: <\/b>Results suggest that doxorubicin increases the level of <i>BRCA2<\/i> exon 3-skipping in MCF7 at concentrations below those required for promoting apoptosis.

BRCA1 heterodimerizes with BRCA1 associated Ring domain 1 (BARD1) to form a complex with DNA binding and ubiquitin E3 ligase function capable of interacting with proteins of diverse biological processes, most notably homology-directed DNA repair. During DNA repair, BRCA1-BARD1 directly interfaces with nucleosomes and transfers mono ubiquitin (Ub) to lysine residues on the C-terminal tail of histone H2A. Although truncation of the enzymatic BRCA1-BARD1 RING-RING domain retains H2A ubiquitylating activity, full-length BRCA1-BARD1 binds more tightly with nucleosomes and displays higher H2A-Ub activity. However, the molecular basis and biological significance for this enhanced nucleosome binding and H2A-Ub activity is uncharacterized.<br \/>Methods: Full length BRCA1-BARD1 or truncated mutants and histones were purified from E. coli. or insect cells. Nucleosomes were assembled for <i>in vitro <\/i>ubiquitylation reaction and binding assays. To determine the biological significance, mammalian cell lines that stably express wild type or mutant forms of BARD1 were established for cellular fractionation, foci analysis, and clonogenic survival studies alongside various DNA damage agents.<br \/>Results: Our results show multiple interaction sites exist between BRCA1-BARD1 and nucleosomes which allow high-affinity chromatin binding and promote increased histone H2A ubiquitylation activity. Multivalent BARD1-nucleosome interactions, namely those using strong binding motifs located in the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of BARD1, and the weak &#8220;kiss&#8221; interaction mediated by the RING domains of both BRCA1 and BARD1, are essential for H2A ubiquitylation by BRCA1-BARD1. Further, we isolated two types of specific histone binding and\/or ubiquitylation-defective mutants of BARD1: a BARD1-IDR mutant with disrupted nucleosome binding withe retained H2A ubiquitylation ability, and a RING mutant that solely impairs H2A ubiquitylation. In both cases, we demonstrate that these mutants are hypersensitive to DNA damage agents, including polyADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, and demonstrate reduced capacity of BARD1 to associate with chromatin and foci formation owing to attenuated repair capacity.<br \/>Conclusion: Our studies provide convincing evidence BRCA1-BARD1 interacts with nucleosomes and ubiquitylates histones via its E3 ligase activity. Further, it plays a critical role in DNA damage response and repair that contributes to genome stability, which when disrupted sensitizes them to DNA damage agents. Our results open new avenues towards understanding whether and how these mutations in BRCA1-BARD1 affect its tumor suppression functions and their implications clinically, ultimately with the goal to translate these findings for the benefit of cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRCA1,Ubiquitination,Histone modification,DNA repair,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Wenjing Li<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Samuel R.

All PARPi both target PARP1 and PARP2, causing cancer cell deaths deficient in HRR. However, only inhibition of PARP1 is required for synthetic lethality in HRR-deficient cells. AZD5305 is a highly selective PARP1 inhibitor which has been used in clinical trials. In this study, we used the Toronto Knock Out Library version 3 (TKOv3), which contains 70948 gRNAs targeting 18,053 protein-coding genes to perform whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screens with three isogenic cell lines 293A, MCF10A, and Hela to uncover known and new high-confidence genes synthetic lethal interacted with AZD5305. MAGeCK and Drug Z were used to analyze the results and genes were ranked according to their drugZ scores. We identify that in all three cell lines, PARP1 was in the top hit in positive selection which proves the AZD5305 indeed a PARP1 inhibitor. Moreover, through a comprehensive and comparative analysis with the screen results of first generation PARPi olaparib, we reveal known and new essential genes which are proved to be a common mechanism for synthetic lethality. We identify the gene AUNIP (Aurora Kinase A and Ninein Interacting Protein), in the top hit from AZD5305 screen but not in olaparib screen, suggesting that AUNIP may be an additional target for synthetic lethality with PARP1 loss. Taken together, this screen reveals the potential molecular genes related with PARP1 inhibitor that can be further explored targeted and combined cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PARP,DNA damage,DNA repair,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ling Yin<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Junjie Chen<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Experimental radiation oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>Experimental Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7fff9c5f-9a4e-4bb5-ac19-dfd17969a8cb","ControlNumber":"6199","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

FA gene mutations are also widespread somatically in non-FA cancer patients. While the FA pathway participates in DNA repair, it is also linked to R-loop metabolism and regulation. R-loops are co-transcriptional RNA:DNA hybrids that form as a result of replication-transcription collisions that are enhanced due to DNA damage, but their aberrant formation drives genomic instability and is an endogenous source of genotoxicity. However, the interplay between FA proteins, DNA repair, and R-loops remains mechanistically ill-defined. Disturbance of mRNA processing, export, and splicing has also been linked to R-loop-mediated genomic instability. The splicing factor SRSF1 participates in mRNA export through the Nuclear Export Factor 1 (NXF1). Aberrant splicing factors expression has been linked to R-loops, cancer, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which clinically resembles FA. In the present study, we study the coupling of the DNA damage response to the prevention of pathogenic R-loops via mRNA export regulation through the FA pathway and SRSF1.<br \/>Methods: Cells: FA-D2 mutant, corrected, and ubiquitin-dead mutant; HeLa. siRNA transfections to reduce SRSF1 and FANCD2 protein levels. Cell survival assays against DNA damaging agents. In vitro immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays using purified SRSF1 and ID2. DART assay, S9.6 immunofluorescence, and S9.6 slot-blot to measure R loops in cells. Immunoprecipitation of mRNPs used to detect mature mRNA-bound ribonucleoproteins. RNA FISH to measure mRNA export.<br \/>Results: In this study, we provide strong evidence that the FA pathway coordinates the prevention of R-loop formation and subsequent genomic instability through its interaction with splicing factors via regulation of mRNA export. First, we demonstrate that knockdown of SRSF1, which is known to result in increased R-loops, also is associated with diminished activation of the FA pathway. Second, the central FA complex ID2 binds to SRSF1 in cells and in recombinant protein assays. Further, we demonstrate that SRSF1 activates the FA pathway by binding ID2 and stimulates its monoubiquitination in an RNA-dependent fashion. This activity is associated with co-localization in cells at transcriptional-DNA damage inducible R loops. In turn, FANCD2 monoubiquitination proves crucial for the assembly of the SRSF1-NXF1 nuclear export complex and mRNA export. Importantly, cancer-associated SRSF1 mutants fail to interact with FANCD2, leading to inefficient FANCD2 monoubiquitination, decreased mRNA export and R-loops accumulation.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings uncover a novel mechanism of FANCD2 and SRSF1 in the prevention of R-loop formation via coupling of mRNA export to the DNA damage response, thus preventing genomic instability.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage,R-loop,mRNA export,Fanconi Anemia,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anne Olazabal-Herrero<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Fengshan Liang<sup>2<\/sup>, Arijit Dutta<sup>3<\/sup>, Yuxin Huang<sup>4<\/sup>, Zhuobin Liang<sup>5<\/sup>, Abhishek Gupta<sup>2<\/sup>, Yaqun Teng<sup>6<\/sup>, Li Lan<sup>6<\/sup>, Xiaoyong Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Huadong Pei<sup>1<\/sup>, Manoj Pillai<sup>2<\/sup>, Patrick Sung<sup>3<\/sup>, Gary Kupfer<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Oncology, Georgetown University, Washington, DC,<sup>2<\/sup>Yale University, New Haven, CT,<sup>3<\/sup>University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Biochemistry and Structural Biology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX,<sup>5<\/sup>Shenzhen Bay Laboratory, Shenzhen, China,<sup>6<\/sup>Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2b094842-6ea4-429d-8aa6-4e9ff5fbe257","ControlNumber":"1420","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

To identify novel proteins that function to modulate DNA damage repair, we screened a library of CRISPR-engineered RNA binding protein knock-out cells. From this analysis, we found that a poorly characterized protein, PUM3, is important DNA damage repair and that PUM3-deficient cells were very sensitive the chemotoxic agents. We show that under normal conditions, PUM3 is localized to the nucleolus and nucleus, where it binds to R-loops and modulates transcription. In this setting, PUM3 functions to suppress\/resolve R-loops and that <i>PUM3<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> cells have elevated R-loop levels. Following DNA damage, PUM3 is rapidly re-localized from the nucleolus to sites of DNA damage in the nucleus by members of the DDX\/DHX family of RNA-helicases. Using small molecule inhibitors and quantitative assays, we find that PUM3 functions in homologous recombination (HR) mediated DNA repair and that <i>PUM3<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> cells have significantly reduced HR-efficiency. PUM3 function at sites of DNA breaks are not affected by transcription or R-loops, implicating PUM3 as functioning after DNA resection during DNA repair. Analysis of TCGA patient data shows that PUM3 levels correlate with Cisplatin resistance and patient outcome. Collectively, our data shows that PUM3 is a previously unknown regulator of R-loops and DNA damage repair that has an important role in chemotherapy sensitivity in cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Homologous recombination,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,DNA double-strand break repair genes,Homologous recombination,RNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Chenyu Lin<sup>1<\/sup>, Jian Ouyang<sup>2<\/sup>, Robert Wine<sup>3<\/sup>, Chen Qiu<sup>3<\/sup>, Jason Williams<sup>3<\/sup>, Traci  M.

Despite recent therapeutic advances, the five-year overall survival rate for PDAC is only 11% and therapies remain limited. It is now known that deficiency in DNA damage repair (DDR) renders PDAC cells vulnerable to certain DNA damage agents, for example, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). Most of the DDR genes mutated in PDAC are crucial for the proper functioning of the homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway, and loss-of-function alterations in DDR genes sensitize cells to DNA-damaging agents. Since this treatment strategy is currently limited to 5-10% of PDAC cases with known mutations in the DDR genes, it underscores a dire need to understand new therapeutic avenues and expand the PDAC patient population that could benefit from this therapeutic approach. We have recently published that BARD1 (<u>B<\/u>RCA1- <u>A<\/u>ssociated- <u>R<\/u>ing- <u>D<\/u>omain- 1), an obligate binding partner of BRCA1, is upregulated in PDAC cells exposed to PARPi\/platinums. We found that transient inhibition of BARD1 rendered PDAC cells extremely sensitive to olaparib (PARPi)\/oxaliplatin (platinum), and enhanced DNA damage. Based on these results, we created two genetic models of BARD1 inhibition and utilized these model systems to investigate if loss of BARD1 chemo-sensitizes PDAC cells to other PARPis and DNA damage agents. Doxycycline inducible shRNA and BARD1 CRISPR KO models were created to inhibit gene expression of BARD1 in PDAC cells. We first characterized these model systems to confirm the loss of BARD1 protein and mRNA expression by western blot and qRT-PCR analyses. Using colony formation and Pico green cell survival assays, we found that inhibiting BARD1 resulted in slower growth of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. Moreover, expression of several cell cycle genes from G2-M phase was significantly decreased (p=0.05). These studies were recapitulated in a mouse xenograft subcutaneous model, where BARD1 KO and WT PDAC cells were injected subcutaneously and tumor growth was analyzed over 25-30 days. Kaplan-Meier curves were calculated and plotted using Log-rank test. We found that inhibiting BARD1 significantly (p=0.026) delayed formation of PDAC tumors in vivo. Next, we analyzed the efficacies of various DNA damaging agents when BARD1 was inhibited. Silencing or CRISPR KO of BARD1 enhanced efficacy of mitomycin C, irinotecan, as well as other PARPis, which are currently in clinical trials (rucaparib, veliparib) in vitro and lowered their IC50s. These results indicate that targeting BARD1 has the potential to benefit patients in terms of novel or improved treatments. Our ongoing and future studies will expand on these findings to understand BARD1-mediated pathway and evaluate sensitivity of multiple DNA damage agents by screening a library of &#38;gt; 250 compounds.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Homologous recombination,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,DNA damage response,PARP inhibitors,Oxaliplatin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sohum Patel<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Anoohya Arkala<sup><\/sup>, Avinoam Nevler<sup><\/sup>, Carolyn Coats<sup><\/sup>, Charles  J.

However, when we transduced Cas9-expressing pancreatic cancer (PC) cell lines with multi-target sgRNAs, in which each sgRNA contains 2-16 target sites in the human genome, we found that most of the reduction in sgRNA tag counts did not occur in the first 7 days post transduction, but rather occurred between days 7 and 21. We demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas9 scission occurs over the course of days in our PC cells and peaked at days 3-5, consistent with another recent observation. Thus, we hypothesized that the mechanism of cell death was likely not due to DNA damage response pathways that were immediately and directly triggered by the multiple scission events, but rather was caused by a slower process. To test this, we treated the Cas9-expressing TS0111 PC cell line with a 14-target sgRNA and performed cytogenetic analysis on cells harvested from 0-21 days after transduction at 3-4 day intervals using a chromosome breakage assay. We observed various karyotypic abnormalities, such as formations of ring, dicentric, and tricentric chromosomes. These abnormalities accumulated over time and peaked at day 14, except for the chromatid and chromosome breaks in which the frequency was maintained through day 21, suggesting ongoing occurrence of breakage events. Analysis of breakpoints on dicentric and tricentric chromosomes showed that although breakpoints at sgRNA targeted regions predominated at early time points and decreased over time, non-targeted regions increased and peaked at day 14. A break-apart FISH assay was also implemented to confirm that these structural variants (SVs) were a direct result of CRISPR-Cas9 cuts, in which the number of cells with abnormal FISH patterns increased over time and also peaked at day 14. Additionally, we performed bioinformatics analyses on the whole genome sequencing data of surviving colonies post treatment of multi-target sgRNAs to identify novel SVs. We found that novel SVs increased as a function of the number of sgRNA target sites, and majority of the SVs were found at non-targeted sites, consistent with ongoing genomic instability. Interestingly, we found that cells responded to the 14-cutter by becoming polyploid, manifesting as extremely large nuclei or multinucleated giant cells. XY FISH showed that polyploidy peaked at day 10 and decreased by day 21. Finally, we assayed for apoptosis, which increased on days 7 and 14 but decreased by day 21. We concluded that cytotoxicity occurred following the induction of multiple DSBs that resulted in ongoing chromosomal rearrangements and polyploidization, ultimately leading to cell death via apoptosis and possibly other mechanisms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomic instability,Cell death,DNA double-strand break,Pancreatic cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Selina Shiqing K.

In this study, we further investigated the role of TONSL in CSC from several cancer cell lines from different tissues. We also analyzed the clinical data available from the public databases to find the clinical impact of TONSL. The higher expression of TONSL is associated with the worse prognosis of lung and gastric cancer. Interestingly, in breast cancer, while its higher expression is also the negative prognostic marker of the luminal A and HER2 positive cancers, that is rather the positive prognostic marker for luminal B and basal cancers. TONSL expression is higher in all 4 subtypes of breast cancer, and ovarian cancer than the corresponding normal tissues. The knockdown of TONSL in an ovarian cancer cell line, OVCAR8, results in the increase of G2\/M cells and apoptotic cells in the bulk cultured population while increase also the senescence cells only in the CSC population leading to the severe loss of CSC population. TONSL and the close binding partner in homologous recombination repair (HRR), MMS22L, both were essential for the CSC growth but the bulk cultured cells could survive without those two in a colon cancer cell line, HCT15 suggesting the importance of HRR in colon CSC. Indeed, gemcitabine treatment induced DNA breaks showed a synergistic cytotoxicity with those two HRR factors knockdown in the CSC only. These results suggest that the TONSL and MMS2L mediated HRR is essential for the CSC and while most of bulk cultured cancer cells circumvent the HRR deficit. Collectively, these data showed that the CSCs ultimately depend on the HRR process which requires TONSL and, therefore, CSC population may be more vulnerable to HRR targeting therapeutic approaches.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Homologous recombination,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Homologous recombination,Cancer stem cell,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Hani Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, SeokGyeong Choi<sup>1<\/sup>, Sojung Ha<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Sukjoon Yoon<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, Woo-Young Kim<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Sookmyung Women's University, College of Pharmacy, Yongsan Gu, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Sookmyung Women's University, Department of Biological Sciences, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"86cf514d-0484-44e2-a553-a814a7017e41","ControlNumber":"6046","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

Chromoplexy is an example of a process driving rapid genome evolution. This mutational signature is detected in ~18% of human cancers (PCAWG Consortium, 2020) and is frequently observed in prostate adenocarcinoma, lymphoid malignancies, and thyroid adenocarcinoma. Chromoplexy is inferred to happen as one catastrophic event that generates copy-neutral chains of translocations involving multiple chromosomes (Baca <i>et al<\/i>., 2013). Existing studies of chromoplexy monitor the outcome of massive cancer genome reorganization, thus early molecular events leading to catastrophic chromosome rearrangements remain elusive. In this work, we aimed to recapitulate molecular mechanisms underlying chromoplexy. For this, we set out to establish a cell line model and use fluorescence-based reporter systems to enrich for and allow isolation of cells containing signatures of chromoplexy. We additionally address whether colocalization of multiple double-strand breaks, for example in transcription hubs or abnormal nuclear structures, might stimulate chained inter- and intra- chromosomal translocations typical for chromoplexy. If successful, this work will provide a mechanistic understanding of an important mutational process driving rapid genome evolution in cancer, congenital disease, and potentially organismal evolution.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-01 Chromosomal structural alterations\/translocations,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromosomal instability,Chromoplexy,Translocation,Gene fusion,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nataliia Serbyn<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Myrthe M.

This cancer typically is not detected, 70-80% of patients, until an advanced stage (stage III-IV). The standard of care OC entails complete surgical resection of all visible abdominal-pelvic tumors, followed by platinum-based chemotherapy combined with a taxane. New recommendations for patients responding to adjuvant therapy is to include a PARP inhibitor with or without bevacizumab for maintenance therapy. Despite initial responses, the majority of stage 3 &#38; 4 more than 70% of OC patients experience recurrent disease. Frequently, individuals become resistant to these treatments. This dreadful circumstance highlights the pressing need to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease's aggressive nature upon recurrence and the development of treatment resistance. Several genetic and epigenetic factors have been linked to the reprogramming of tumor cells by controlling the pattern of transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene expression. Particularly, the miRNA-mediated regulatory circuit plays a significant role in tumor progression and therapeutic responses. Our analysis of miRNA expression signature in human ovarian cancer cell line panel showed little to no expression of miR221_5p and a corresponding increase in DNA damage response and repair gene RAD18 expression. RAD18 plays a critical role in cellular DNA damage tolerance and repair activity against chemotherapeutics, including platinum drugs. Similarly, loss of miRNA221_5p is associated with aggressive tumor cell growth, stemness, chemoresistance to platinum drugs, and poor prognosis in several cancers. Based on this information, we have hypothesized that miR221_5p regulates RAD18-mediated DNA damage tolerance and repair and may offer novel therapeutic intervention to overcome EOC chemoresistance. Our experimental data confers that miR221_5p post-transcriptionally regulates RAD18 by binding to its 3&#8217;-UTR region and restores OC cell sensitivity to platinum drugs. Mechanistically, our results demonstrate that miRNA221_5p epigenetically regulates RAD18-mediated DNA damage tolerance and homologous recombination repair and could be a novel therapeutic to overcome OC chemoresistance. Collectively, our studies identify a novel chemotherapy-induced epigenetic modulator in OC therapeutic resistance and offer novel miRNA 221-5p-mediated therapeutic intervention for the treatment of chemoresistant OC and to prevent disease recurrence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Homologous recombination,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Chemoresistance,MicroRNA,Post-transcriptional regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tasmin Rahman Omy<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chinnadurai Mani<sup>2<\/sup>, Komaraiah Palle<sup>2<\/sup>, Mark Reedy<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>Cell Biology and Biochemistry, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX,<sup>3<\/sup>Obstetrics and Gynecology, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a5e62d5b-ae9a-4474-95d8-52ecb8a96f8d","ControlNumber":"3643","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

AMBRA1 was recently found to function as a substrate receptor for the cullin-4-based ubiquitin ligase (CRL4<sup>AMBRA1<\/sup>) that promotes the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of D-type cyclins (cyclin D1, D2 and D3); this serves to guard against premature S-phase entry and replication stress, providing a potential mechanism for its tumor suppressive activity. Cyclin D1 protein, which is stabilized, along with cyclin D2 and D3, in AMBRA1-deficient cells, has been shown to promote homologous recombination (HR) repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), suggesting that AMBRA1 may be additionally involved in the repair of DSBs. Using our recently published CRISPR-Cas9-based dual fluorescent reporter assay system, we show that while the loss of AMBRA1 increased D-type cyclins and Rb hyperphosphorylation as expected, it did, surprisingly, inhibit HR-mediated repair and stimulated error-free non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), and that both of these new activities are independent of cyclin D1 or RB1. High-throughput sequencing of DSB repair junctions confirm these results and shows significant depletion of indels with reduction in microhomology-mediated end-joining in AMBRA1-deficient cells, suggesting that AMBRA1 plays a role in promoting resection at DSBs. In support of this hypothesis, we found that the loss of AMBRA1 reduces RAD51 recruitment to DSBs in cells exposed to ionizing radiation. Consistent with its role in promoting HR, we found that AMBRA1-deficient cells are significantly more sensitive to PARP inhibitors compared to AMBRA1-proficient cells. In summary, we show that<i> <\/i>AMBRA1 is a novel regulator of DSBs, and that its downregulation in cancer cells and tumors render cancer cells susceptible to inhibition by PARP inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Homologous recombination,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Homologous recombination,Tumor suppressor,PARP inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yuning Jiang<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Tarek Abbas<\/b><sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Radiation Oncology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0ade8eaf-33e7-4c7e-972c-eea48c71a2b9","ControlNumber":"2736","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

While different approaches exist, such as the RAD51 immunofluorescence (IF) or HRD genomic assays, functional biomarkers that can assess HR proficiency are missing. We report here the development, optimization and validation of two complementary, HR-specific functional assays. The assays, which are based on the STRIDE platform technology, detect double-strand DNA breaks localized in close proximity to RPA or RAD51 proteins. The optimization phase of assay development was performed in U2OS cells. First, repeatability (intra-run variation) and reproducibility (inter-run variation) of the assays were measured in untreated cells. Then, a series of technical negative controls was performed which have shown that the number of false-positive readouts is below 10% of the total number of signals. Finally, treatment of cells with compounds known to induce double-strand DNA breaks (etoposide and cisplatin) resulted in statistically significant increase in the number of detected dSTRIDE-RAD51 and dSTRIDE-RPA foci when compared to untreated controls. The assays were further validated in NCI-H661 (BRCA2 wild-type) and NCI-H169 (BRCA2 KO) cells. The cells were treated with two concentrations of etoposide and the readouts from dSTRIDE, detecting the total pool of DSBs and dSTRIDE-HR assays were compared. In NCI-H661 cells, treatment with etoposide resulted in an increase in the number of double-strand breaks detected by dSTRIDE and as expected, more DSBs were formed after treatment with the higher concentration. dSTRIDE-HR assays confirmed that approximately 15% and 10% of these DSBs contain RPA and RAD51 proteins, respectively. In NCI-H169 cells etoposide produced a stronger reaction with even more DSBs detected by dSTRIDE, but importantly, no increase in the number of dSTRIDE-RAD51 foci was observed. dSTRIDE-RPA foci increased after treatment hinting that this step of HR remains unperturbed. Interestingly, the number of dSTRIDE-RAD51 foci in untreated cells was comparable between the two cell lines. In conclusion, we show here that two newly developed dSTRIDE-HR assays are well validated and can be successfully applied to report on the status of homologous recombination repair in different cell models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Homologous recombination,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA double-strand break,Homologous recombination,Biomarkers,RAD51,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kamil Solarczyk<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Agnieszka Waligórska<sup><\/sup>, Karolina Uzna&#324;ska<sup><\/sup>, Zsombor Prucsi<sup><\/sup>, Olga Wójcikowska<sup><\/sup>, Ewelina Matuszyk<sup><\/sup>, Magdalena Barty&#324;ska<sup><\/sup>, Agata Kitli&#324;ska<sup><\/sup>, Aleksandra Bober<sup><\/sup>, Franek Sierpowski<sup><\/sup>, Maja Bia&#322;ecka<sup><\/sup>, Monika Jarosz<sup><\/sup>, Malgorzata Szczygiel<sup><\/sup>, Szymon Koman<sup><\/sup>, Karolina Korpanty<sup><\/sup>, Lukasz Beben<sup><\/sup>, Lukasz Bandzarewicz<sup><\/sup>, Przemyslaw Stachura<sup><\/sup>, Magdalena Kordon-Kiszala<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>intoDNA, Kraków, Poland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c3e85b07-db11-43fc-8957-2080724fb7df","ControlNumber":"5037","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

Large genomic rearrangements (LGRs) are defined as deletions, duplications or insertions; often involving a significant portion of an exon. &nbsp;Usually pathogenic, they have been reported to account for up to 27% of the BRCA1 and 5% of BRCA2 disease-causing mutations with a strong founder effect accounting for about 1\/3 of all cancer diagnoses in some populations. Accurate detection of a BRCA1\/2 pathogenic variants has immense impact on clinical management of disease including&nbsp;eligibility for PARP inhibitor therapy. However, these LGRs are frequently missed by PCR-based methods and NGS assays that do not detect partial or complete exon losses or gains. Given the difficulty in detecting LGRs, there is a need for improvement of BRCA1\/2 testing algorithms including reference materials that incorporate challenging LGRs to support NGS assays that analyze for these mutations. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br \/>Biosynthetic DNA constructs bearing clinically relevant BRCA1\/2 variants including deletions up to 500 bp spanning 2 exons and duplications up to 170 bp, were mixed with purified genomic DNA from the GM24385 human reference cell line at 10% and 50% variant allele frequency (VAF) to represent somatic and inherited BRCA disease states, respectively. The same variants were engineered into GM24385 cells at the desired VAF (&#62;5%) and the cells were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded using a proprietary method to mimic preserved tumor biopsies. In both materials, VAF was measured using digital PCR. The prepared purified gDNA and FFPE materials were sent to multiple clinical laboratories and analyzed using various NGS assays to assess variant detection performance and ensure that the product was compatible with clinical testing workflows.<br \/>Digital PCR confirmed the presence of all 20 BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants within a 20% range of the target VAF in the purified gDNA material and between 11-23% in FFPE. NGS results were variable but confirmed the presence of most&nbsp;variants. A few variants were detected at very low levels but reported as not detected by the bioinformatic software due to limit of detection.<br \/>We have successfully developed a reference material to support both BRCA1 and BRCA2 inherited and somatic genetic testing, providing laboratories and assay developers with a tool to challenge and optimize their assay&#8217;s detection and quantitation of pathogenic variants by NGS.&nbsp;Provided as full process in FFPE format or in purified gDNA, these reference materials include 11 challenging LGRs, which are useful in evaluating the ability of different NGS platforms to detect such variants.

HRD status is an emerging therapeutic biomarker; NGS assays that measure it can be used to stratify ovarian and breast cancer patients and determine eligibility for clinical trials, and PARP inhibitor- and platinum-based therapies. Seraseq FFPE HRD reference materials were developed to cover a range of genomic instability scores (GIS) to help NGS HRD assay validation and development. Here we discuss a multi-site evaluation across various platforms of our high-positive, low-positive, and negative HRD reference materials. &nbsp;<br \/>Tumor cell lines were characterized by sequencing and evaluated in collaboration with several IVD partners. Three breast cancer cell lines (along with their SNP-matched normal cell lines) were selected based on their GIS. Tumor cells were blended with their SNP-matched normal cells to achieve ~65% tumor content. Biosynthetic DNA containing mutations in homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes (ATM, BRIP1, RAD51C, RAD51D) were added to the high-positive and negative reference materials targeted at &#62;5% variant allele frequency (VAF) and measured by digital PCR. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) blocks were made and each block was tested for yield per curl using both the Qiagen QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit and the Maxwell RSC DNA FFPE Kit for extraction and Qubit dsDNA HS kit for concentration analysis.

When PARP1 or PARP2 binds damaged DNA, it adds poly(ADP-ribose) chains to its own backbone and to other DDR proteins, which recruits and activates them. PARylated PARP1\/2 next detaches from the DNA so that the other PARylated proteins can initiate the repair process. It has been observed that some PARP inhibitors prevent PARP1\/2 from dissociating the DNA. The continuous presence of PARP at the site of damage prevents repair and blocks replication, leading to cell death. Therefore, drugs that trap PARP1\/2 to the DNA tend to be significantly more cytotoxic than other PARP inhibitors, which is highly desirable. This study describes the design and optimization of novel PARPtrap assays to specifically assess the ability of a drug to trap PARP onto DNA. The assay is based on principles of fluorescence polarization and uses fluorescently labeled DNA probes that are excited by polarized light and emit light with a degree of polarization that is proportional to the rate of molecular rotation. The free DNA probes that rotate fast have low fluorescence polarization (FP), but high FP when are bound to PARP1 or PARP2. When NAD+ is added, the PARylated enzymes detach from the probe, reducing FP levels. If a PARP inhibitor is added, the inhibitor&#8217;s trapping ability increases FP in a dose-dependent manner.Proof-of-principle titration of known PARP-trapping inhibitors (Talazoparib, AZD305, Olaparib and Veliparib) was performed to validate the assay. We observed that:i)The known relative trapping efficacies of Talazoparib, Olaparib and Veliparib were similar to known relative efficacies. ii)Talazoparib, Olaparib and Veliparib had similar trapping efficacy against PARP1 and PARP2, as measured by their EC<sub>50<\/sub>, whereas AZD305 was 1,000 times more efficient at trapping PARP1 than it was PARP2, demonstrating selectivity between PARP1 and PARP2.iii)AZD305 displayed as efficient DNA trapping activity toward PARP1 as best-in-class Talazoparib. In summary, we have designed an innovative PARPtrap assay designed for the high throughput screening of small molecule libraries to specifically identify or compare inhibitors that are capable of trapping PARP1 and\/or PARP2 onto DNA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,PARP,Fluorescence,PARP inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Kasia Zientara-Rytter<sup><\/sup>, <b>Veronique  T.

This improvement is marked in patients carrying <i>BRCA <\/i>mutations, and in Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) subgroups. To date, identifying patients eligible for PARPi has been a challenge for scientific and clinical teams using next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis and the persistence of genomic scars in tumors after restoration of proficient HR or epigenetic changes is a limitation of NGS. Functional assays could be used to improve the profiling of HR status and faithfully identify HRD tumors. The Repair Capacity Test assesses the formation of RAD51 foci in proliferating cells after irradiation and can be used on fresh primary cancer tissues irradiated <i>ex vivo<\/i> as well as on Patient-Derived Tumor Organoids (PDTO). However, RAD51 foci scoring is often performed manually without any possibility for the standardization of techniques. By contrast, recent progress in whole slide imaging referring to scan a complete microscope slide and creating a single high-resolution digital file, could represent an opportunity for automatizing the evaluation of HR. The purpose of this translational study was to develop an automated tool for scoring RAD51-mediated homologous recombination, to use this tool on ovarian PDTO and to compare the result to the sensitivity to olaparib (PARPi), determined by direct exposure of PDTO to the drug. We show that immunofluorescence of RAD51 foci can be automatically detected and quantified in Cyclin A2 positive nuclei in all the cells of each PDTO slice thus offering a new opportunity for the routine management and standardization of HR assessment in PDTO that goes beyond the widely used manual estimation. Finally, this automated scoring will be optimized to directly assess HR on tumor slices to make the Repair Capacity Test a highly relevant functional precision oncology tool to identify patients who will benefit from PARPi.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Homologous recombination,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Homologous recombination,PARP inhibitors,Ovarian cancer,Organoids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lucie Thorel<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Pierre-Marie Morice<sup>1<\/sup>, Nicolas Elie<sup>2<\/sup>, Louis-Bastien Weiswald<sup>1<\/sup>, Romane Florent<sup>1<\/sup>, Florence Giffard<sup>1<\/sup>, Margaux Jacobs<sup>1<\/sup>, Agathe Ricou<sup>3<\/sup>, Raphaël Leman<sup>3<\/sup>, Guillaume Babin<sup>4<\/sup>, Jean-François Lebrun<sup>4<\/sup>, Sandrine Martin<sup>4<\/sup>, Mélanie Briand<sup>1<\/sup>, Benoit Goudergues<sup>1<\/sup>, Bernard Lambert<sup>1<\/sup>, Cécile Blanc-Fournier<sup>5<\/sup>, Dominique Vaur<sup>3<\/sup>, Benoit Plancoulaine<sup>2<\/sup>, Laurent Poulain<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Normandy University, UNICAEN, INSERM U1086 ANTICIPE (Interdisciplinary Research Unit for Cancers Prevention and Treatment), BioTICLA lab.

Platinum sensitivity is also considered a surrogate marker of PARPi efficacy. However, the prognostic accuracy remains a challenge because these tests can only infer homologous recombination functionality but not directly measure it. Moreover, the association between platinum and PARPi response is imperfect since not all platinum-sensitive patients benefit from PARPi and PARPi response has been observed in platinum-resistant cancers. A panel of 20 high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma patient-derived xenografts (OC-PDXs) were molecularly and pharmacologically characterized to assess predictive markers of response to PARPi therapy. Genomic DNA and total RNA were sequenced searching for BRCA1\/2 alterations or sent to Myriad Genetics to obtain HRD scores. Absolute BRCA1 mRNA expression was measured by RT-qPCR. OC-PDXs growing subcutaneously or orthotopically in nude mice were treated with the PARPi olaparib or platinum to test drug sensitivity. The molecular analyses revealed that nearly 90% (17\/20) of OC-PDXs are TP53 mutated, thus reflecting the clinical scenario. 50% (10\/20) of OC-PDXs harbor mutations in BRCA1\/2 genes, while 10% (2\/20) lack BRCA1 mRNA expression. MyChoice&#174; assay showed that 65% (13\/20) of OC-PDXs score higher than 42, which is the currently used threshold to classify HRD-positive tumors. Correlation analysis confirmed that the HRD score is highly associated with the presence of mutations in BRCA1\/2 genes. Preclinical testing showed that 50% of OC-PDXs are sensitive to olaparib. Notably, in 20% of cases the therapeutic response was incorrectly predicted considering either BRCA1\/2 mutations or HRD score. 30% of platinum-sensitive OC-PDXs were not responsive to olaparib, confirming that platinum sensitivity not always correlate with response to PARPi. Our results show that tumor genotype and HRD score are strongly associated. Further analyses are required to improve the predictive value of currently used tests to select patients who will benefit the most from PARPi treatment while sparing toxicities in patients that are unlikely to respond.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-03 Homologous recombination,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Homologous recombination,PARP inhibitors,Ovarian cancer,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Giulia Dellavedova<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Alessandra Decio<sup><\/sup>, Laura Formenti<sup><\/sup>, Luca Porcu<sup><\/sup>, Carmen Ghilardi<sup><\/sup>, Raffaella Giavazzi<sup><\/sup>, Maria Rosa Bani<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, Milano, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"859118f1-f79c-43f3-a996-b8892e7dd8eb","ControlNumber":"4389","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>G.

African American men are diagnosed with and succumb to prostate cancer at higher rates than other demographic groups. However, the biological drivers contributing to poorer outcomes in African American men compared to European American men with prostate cancer are still poorly defined. One understudied area is DNA repair defects, which drive genomic instability in cancers. Defects in homologous recombination are often at the forefront of repair defects examined and exploited for therapeutic intervention. However, defects in other DNA repair pathways may contribute to poor disease outcomes and chemoresistance. We demonstrated that defects in the base excision repair (BER) pathway contribute to chemoresistance and alter growth in breast cancer. Others have also shown chemoresistant effects from dysregulated BER protein expression in gastric, colorectal, and ovarian cancers. Examination of the TCGA database show dysregulation of key BER protein like X-ray cross complementing protein 1 (XRCC1) and DNA polymerase &#946; (POL&#946;) are common across several cancers. Therefore, we decided to explore DNA damage and repair defects in prostate cancer to explore if altered DNA repair contributes to poorer outcomes in African American men. To measure DNA repair defects in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, we employed a novel assay, Repair Assisted Damage Detection (RADD), which measures DNA lesions within the tissues. RADD fluorescently tags DNA lesions for quantification and is compatible with immunohistochemistry detection of DNA repair or other proteins of interest. Using the tissue microarrays, we used RADD to discover that prostate tumors from African American patients have more uracil and pyrimidine lesions, elevated uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG) levels, and reduced XRCC1 levels than European American tumors, which indicate defects in the BER pathway. In addition, these men had higher uracil monophosphate (UMP) and lower expression of folate cycle metabolites, suggesting that metabolic rewiring may also contribute to the dysregulation of BER. Defects in the BER pathway may offer new therapeutic opportunities for African American prostate cancer patients. These defects may be targeted by therapeutics which pressure the BER pathways. This work demonstrates that functional detection of DNA repair defects through RADD offers new insight into race-specific DNA repair defects offering new molecular targets or therapeutic strategies to reduce racial disparities in prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-02 Genomic instability,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,African American,Base excision repair,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Kaveri Goel<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Kimiko Krieger<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, Manoj Sonavane<sup>1<\/sup>, Arun Sreekumar<sup>2<\/sup>, Natalie R.

The five-year overall survival rate for SCLC patients is only ~7%, a statistic that has not improved for decades. Compared to non-small cell lung cancers, SCLCs highly express DNA repair proteins. Despite this acknowledgement, a comprehensive analysis of the DNA repair machinery within SCLC has not been completed. This study was performed to study the SCLC DNA repair landscape.<br \/>Methods: We applied a novel DNA repair analysis method to IMPOWER133 (n = 271) and MD Anderson GEMINI (n = 85) clinical SCLC datasets. This single-sample weighted expression (ssWE) method uses transcriptomic data to assess regulation of ten single-strand break repair, double-strand break repair, translesion synthesis, and damage sensing pathways within individual tumors. Importantly, this method considers all pathway effectors and applies a scaling factor to capture effector essentiality to repair completion. Unsupervised k-means clustering was used to group samples following ssWE analysis. Chi-square tests were used to test for significant enrichment patterns between DNA repair and established SCLC transcription factor (TF) subtypes assignments.<br \/>Results: Unsupervised clustering demonstrated that IMPOWER133 and GEMINI SCLCs were robustly split into three clusters as defined by their DNA repair phenotypes (DNA Damage Response (DDR) High, Intermediate, Low). We found that expression of DNA damage responsive transcription factors (E2F1, MYBL2, FOXM1) and the intra-S and G2\/M checkpoint machinery significantly increased across DDR clusters (High&#62;Intermediate&#62;Low). Also, we found that SCLC TF subtypes showed statistically significant enrichment patterns across DDR clusters (IMPOWER133, MDACC &#935;<sup>2<\/sup> p&#60;0.001). Most notably, inflamed SCLC (SCLC-I) were significantly under-represented in the DDR High cluster. Given this, we hypothesized that DDR Low tumors exhibited a more &#8220;inflamed&#8221; phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we isolated ASCL1+ SCLC (SCLC-A) tumors, which are considered &#8220;immune cold&#8221; compared to other subtypes, stratified them by their DDR status, and analyzed expression patterns of key immune genes. Strikingly, we found that splitting treatment na&#239;ve SCLC-A tumors by their DDR status identified tumors that appeared more &#8220;inflamed&#8221; (DDR Low). DDR Low SCLC-A showed increased expression of MHC Class I and inflammatory cytokine genes. Conversely, DDR High SCLC-A tumors exhibited an immune evasive profile.<br \/>Conclusions: We provide the first evidence that SCLCs exhibit a spectrum of DNA repair machinery and cell cycle checkpoint pathway expression within TF subtypes. Additionally, we find that DDR status may be a key determinant of &#8220;inflamed&#8221; biology in treatment na&#239;ve SCLC-A&#8212;the predominant form of SCLC&#8212;independent of the SCLC-I subtype. Moving forward, our results have important implications for SCLC treatment and clinical trial design.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA repair,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Benjamin B.

About 80 percent patients with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) develop local recurrence and about 60 percent distant metastasis. NSCLC subtype, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) accounts for about 40% of all lung cancers. Recently, targeted therapy with chemotherapy combination has shown to enhance the pathologic complete response rate in a subgroup of NSCLC patients, but most patients do not benefit from therapy due to development of resistance. Thus, identifying molecular drivers of primary and adaptive chemotherapy resistance that can be effectively targeted represents a critical unmet clinical need. Here we aim to evaluate BUB1 (a mitotic checkpoint kinase) as a viable molecular target for increasing the effectiveness of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in LUAD. Bioinformatic analyses were conducted to evaluate BUB1 expression across lung cancer and normal tissues. BUB1 was found to be overexpressed in LUAD compared to normal tissues and BUB1 expression also correlated with cancer stage and tumor grade. LUAD cell lines A549, H1975 and H2030 were used to study the effect of BUB1 inhibition on chemo-radiosensitization. MTT cell proliferation and clonogenic cell survival studies were conducted with pharmacological (BAY1816032) and genomic (CRISPR) BUB1 ablation in combination with Platinum (Cisplatin), Taxol (Paclitaxel) or a PARP inhibitor (Olaparib) without\/with radiation. BUB1 inhibition showed cytotoxicity in LUAD cell lines at micromolar concentration and enhanced the radiation mediated cell killing at nanomolar concentration. Moreover, BUB1 inhibition sensitized LUAD cell lines to Cisplatin, Paclitaxel and Olaparib in double or triple chemotherapy combinations. Additionally, BUB1 inhibition significantly increased LUAD cell death when combined with different classes of chemotherapies with radiation (chemo-radiation). Our preliminary mechanistic studies revealed prolonged presence of &#947;H2AX foci, an indicator of DNA double stand breaks. BLRR DNA damage reporter assay indicated that the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway was inhibited upon BUB1 ablation. Detailed mechanistic studies combining BUB1 ablation with chemo-radiation are underway to delineate signaling cascades involved in BUB1 driven chemo-radiation sensitization. Our data provides evidence that BUB1 inhibition sensitizes lung adenocarcinoma to radiotherapy, different classes of chemotherapy and chemo-radiation through DNA-double strand break repair pathways and provides rationale for clinical trials that combine BUB1 inhibition with chemo-radiation in NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-05 Radiation-induced DNA damage,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Adenocarcinoma,Mitotic checkpoint kinase,BUB1,Chemo-radiosensitization,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shivani Thoidingjam<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sushmitha Sriramulu<sup>1<\/sup>, Farzan Siddiqui<sup>1<\/sup>, Benjamin Movsas<sup>1<\/sup>, Shirish Gadgeel<sup>2<\/sup>, Shyam Nyati<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Radiation Oncology, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Medical Oncology, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2815aaac-6e3e-451e-9704-44c50e1c5ba7","ControlNumber":"5135","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) can deliver radiation to metastatic tumor sites. In preclinical studies, combining low dose TRT with immune checkpoint blockade augments the anti-tumor immune response, promoting the immune susceptibility of metastatic disease sites. Radionuclides differ in their physical properties such as emission type, linear energy transfer (LET), half-life, and tissue range. In this study, clinically relevant &#945;- and &#946;-emitting radionuclides (<sup>225<\/sup>Ac, <sup>90<\/sup>Y, <sup>177<\/sup>Lu) were compared in vitro in MOC2 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and B78 melanoma. We hypothesized that the unique physical properties of radionuclides would differentially impact the quantity and accumulation over time of double stranded DNA breaks, mirroring the timing of effects on tumor cell immune susceptibility markers.<br \/>Methods: MOC2 or B78 cells were grown in culture and treated with external beam radiation (EBRT), or culture media containing <sup>90<\/sup>Y, <sup>177<\/sup>Lu, or <sup>225<\/sup>Ac delivering continuous radiation at activity levels using GEANT4 Monte Carlo to deliver 12 Gy (MOC2) and 4 Gy (B78) to the cell monolayer. Cells were harvested, and cDNA was isolated for RT-qPCR one, three, and seven days after the start of irradiation. Additional cells treated in this manner were fixed and stained with DAPI\/&#947;-H2AX antibody for confocal microscopy at the same timepoints. &#947;-H2AX foci\/cell were quantified manually using ImageJ.<br \/>Results: &#947;-H2AX foci counts\/cell increased significantly and accumulated over time following treatment with <sup>225<\/sup>Ac, but not with <sup>90<\/sup>Y or <sup>177<\/sup>Lu. EBRT, <sup>90<\/sup>Y, and <sup>225<\/sup>Ac, but not <sup>177<\/sup>Lu, upregulated expression of immune response associated genes (<i>Fas<\/i>, <i>Pdl1<\/i>, <i>Mhc1<\/i>) compared to non-irradiated controls. In cells treated with EBRT every 24h at doses mimicking the interval dose delivered by continuous exponential decay of <sup>90<\/sup>Y and <sup>225<\/sup>Ac, but not <sup>177<\/sup>Lu, the time course and magnitude of <i>Fas<\/i> and <i>Pdl1<\/i> expression phenocopied that of these radionuclides.<br \/>Conclusions: DNA damage accumulation and the timing of immunomodulation are modified by the dose, dose-rate, and LET of radiation emitted from a given radionuclide. Understanding the effects of radionuclide therapies on cancer cell immunogenicity could enable rational design of clinical trials that investigate the integration of TRT and immunotherapies into the clinical care of patients with metastatic cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-05 Radiation-induced DNA damage,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,Immunoassay,Radiation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Julia Sheehan-Klenk<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Caroline P.
