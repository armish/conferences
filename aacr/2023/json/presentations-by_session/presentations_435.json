[{"Abstract":"MHC class I-associated peptides (MAPs), collectively referred to as the immunopeptidome, have a pivotal role in cancer immunosurveillance. While MAPs were long thought to be solely generated by the degradation of canonical proteins, recent advances in the field of proteogenomics (genomically-informed proteomics) evidenced that &#8764;10% of them originate from allegedly noncoding genomic sequences. Among these sequences, endogenous retroelements (EREs) are under intense scrutiny as a possible source of actionable tumor antigens (TAs). With the increasing number of cancer-oriented immunopeptidomic and proteogenomic studies comes the need to accurately attribute an RNA expression level to each MAP identified by mass-spectrometry. Here, we introduce BamQuery (BQ), a computational tool to attribute an exhaustive RNA expression to MAPs of any genomic origin (exon, intron, UTR, intergenic) from bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing data. By using BQ on large datasets of published MAPs identified by mass spectrometry, we show that many of them can arise from more than one genomic region. Indeed, 27% of MAPs reported as deriving from protein-coding exons (canonical MAPs) could also arise from non-canonical genomic regions, sometimes with greater probability, and 61% of non-canonical MAPs could arise from more than a single genomic origin (334 possible regions on average per non-canonical MAP; up to 35,343 for EREs). The consideration of all these origins evidenced an unsuspected high RNA expression in normal human tissues of (i) published neoantigens \/ TAs (mutated or not); (ii) MAPs derived from proteasomal splicing, supposedly not genomically templated, and (iii) MAPs derived from viruses. In particular, the high expression of candidate immunotherapeutic targets such as TAs highlights the relevance of BamQuery and the necessity of using it to validate such antigens before translating their usage in clinical trials. We also demonstrate that BamQuery can be used to directly identify safe and actionable TAs as well as to predict their immunogenicity through our freely accessible web portal (https:\/\/bamquery.iric.ca\/search). Therefore, BQ could become an essential tool in any TA prioritization pipeline in the near future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antigen,Cancer immunotherapy,MHC I,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Maria-Virginia Ruiz Cuevas<sup>1<\/sup>, Marie-Pierre Hardy<sup>1<\/sup>, Jean-David Larouche<sup>1<\/sup>, Anca Apavaloaei<sup>1<\/sup>, Eralda Kina<sup>1<\/sup>, Krystel Vincent<sup>1<\/sup>, Patrick Gendron<sup>1<\/sup>, Jean-Philippe Laverdure<sup>1<\/sup>, Chantal Durette<sup>1<\/sup>, Pierre Thibault<sup>1<\/sup>, Sebastien Lemieux<sup>1<\/sup>, Claude Perreault<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Gregory Ehx<\/b><sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>IRIC, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada,<sup>2<\/sup>GIGA-I3: Hematology, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"de622793-df4b-4ebe-b065-3992eda2e9ae","ControlNumber":"2035","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

In colorectal cancer (CRC), tsMHC-II negativity is common and in cell lines is attributable to CIITA promoter methylation. To clarify mechanisms of tsMHC-II repression in CRC we analyzed CRC organoids which are epigenetically faithful to tissue of origin.<br \/>Methods: 15 primary CRC organoids were treated with IFN&#947; +\/- epigenetic modifiers. Flow cytometry was used to assess for tsMHC-II inducibility. RT-qPCR, total RNAseq, nanopore sequencing, bisulfite conversion\/pyrosequencing and western blotting were used to quantitate CIITA, STAT1, IRF1 and JAK1 expression, gene structure and promoter methylation and ChIP-PCR to quantitate H3K9ac, H3K9Me2 and EZH2 occupancy at <i>CIITA<\/i>.<br \/>Results: We define three types of tsMHC-II response to IFN&#947; in CRC: strong- (&#8805;50%), delayed\/weak- (11-49%) and non-inducibility (&#8804;10%). 8\/15 demonstrated strong expression, 4\/15 delayed\/weak: although it was possible to overcome this weak expression with prolonged IFN&#947; exposure in 3\/15 without additional pharmacological treatment. In 1\/15 organoid, expression was restricted even with prolonged exposure due to IFN&#947;-mediated EZH2 occupancy at <i>CIITA: <\/i>tsMHC-II expression was enhanced by EZH2 and HDAC inhibition<i>. <\/i>Non-inducibility is seen in 3 CMS1 organoids due to JAK1 mutation. These demonstrated low level (11%) JAK1 promoter methylation, but tsMHC-II inducibility was not rescued with DNMT inhibition. No organoid demonstrated CIITA promoter methylation, despite confirming the presence in previously described 2D cell lines, suggesting this is acquired through culture methods and not reflective of disease biology.<br \/>Conclusion: We demonstrate using epigenetically appropriate models the individual variation in pharmacologic tractability of epigenetic modification in CRC. Providing IFN&#947; signaling is intact, most CRC organoids are class II inducible. Up-regulation of restricted tsMHC-II through targeted epigenetic therapy is seen in 1\/15 organoid. These data may explain some of the disappointing results of immuno-epigenetic approaches in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-02 Epigenetic regulation of tumor immunity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Organoids,Epigenetics,Antigen presentation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Oliver  J.

Whereas GL261-luc2 is readily responsive to several immunotherapies, CT2A-luc is broadly resistant to diverse immunotherapeutic modalities. To decipher the cell-intrinsic mechanisms that drive immunotherapy resistance in CT2A-luc and to define the aspects of human cancer biology that these lines can best model, we systematically compared their genomic and phenotypic profiles.<br \/>The transcriptional profiles of GL261-luc2 and CT2A-luc tumors resembled those of huGBM, despite neither line sharing the canonical genetic or histologic features of huGBM. Both models exhibited striking hypermutation and contained clonal hotspot mutations in RAS genes (<i>Kras<\/i> p.G12C in GL261-luc2 and <i>Nras<\/i> p.Q61L in CT2A-luc), which have only been identified in &#60;1% of huGBM tumors.<br \/>CT2A-luc distinctly displayed mesenchymal differentiation, upregulated angiogenesis, and multiple defects in antigen presentation machinery and interferon response pathways -- confirmed at the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic levels. CT2A-luc uniquely contained multiple mutations in antigen presentation machinery genes that were computationally predicted to have deleterious biologic effects, including a clonal p.A275P missense mutation in <i>Psmb8<\/i> (a subunit of the immunoproteasome, which degrades proteins into peptides for loading onto MHC class I) and a clonal p.Y488C missense mutation in <i>Tap1<\/i> (which transports peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum for loading onto MHC class I). CT2A-luc also distinctly exhibited a single-copy loss of a chromosomal segment involving 4qC4 (FDR-adjusted p=0.04), which encompassed multiple type I IFN genes, as well as a single-copy loss of 10qD2-10qD3 (FDR-adjusted p=0.04), which contained <i>Stat2, Stat6<\/i>, and<i> Ifng<\/i>. Consistent with our observation of down-regulated IFN response pathways in CT2A-luc, phosphoproteomic analysis revealed decreased phosphorylation of several members of the JAK\/STAT pathway in <i>ex vivo<\/i> CT2A-luc tumors, including Ptpn11 (i.e., Shp2), Il13ra1, and Stat3 - together suggesting reduced JAK\/STAT signaling. Additionally, CT2A-luc demonstrated substantial baseline secretion of the CCL-2, CCL-5, and CCL-22 chemokines, all of which are known to play important roles as myeloid chemoattractants, in marked contrast to GL261-luc2.<br \/>The defect in MHC class I expression could be overcome in CT2A-luc by interferon-&#947; treatment, which may underlie the modest efficacy of some immunotherapy combinations for CT2A-luc. Thus, CT2A-luc may be an informative preclinical model of immunotherapy resistance due to its mesenchymal differentiation and antigen presentation machinery deficits.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-07 Novel animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Mouse models,Resistance,Antigen presentation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Bryan Iorgulescu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Neil Ruthen<sup>2<\/sup>, Ryuhjin Ahn<sup>3<\/sup>, Eleni Panagioti<sup>4<\/sup>, Prafulla Gokhale<sup>1<\/sup>, Martha Neagu<sup>5<\/sup>, Maria Speranza<sup>1<\/sup>, Benjamin Eschle<sup>1<\/sup>, Kara Soroko<sup>1<\/sup>, Raziye Piranlioglu<sup>4<\/sup>, Meenal Datta<sup>6<\/sup>, Shanmugarajan Krishnan<sup>6<\/sup>, Kathleen Yates<sup>6<\/sup>, Gregory Baker<sup>5<\/sup>, Rakesh Jain<sup>6<\/sup>, Mario Suva<sup>6<\/sup>, Donna Neuberg<sup>2<\/sup>, Forest White<sup>3<\/sup>, E.

One of the hallmarks of CRC is its complex mutational landscape that contributes to the derivation of neoantigens which aid the immunosurveillance of the cancer. Immunopeptides play an essential role in adaptive immunity by activating and ensuring T-cell specificity. Mass spectrometry (MS) is currently the only technology that can measure and identify the immunopeptide profiles of biological samples at a large scale, however, MS-based studies are frequently limited by sample input and poor scalability. Here, we introduce a semi-automated workflow requiring low sample input to robustly identify immunopeptides and apply it to a cohort of fresh frozen, high quality CRC samples (Indivumed) for immunopeptide profiling and neoantigen identification. We initially optimized a workflow that allowed the native lysis and sequential immunoprecipitation of class-I and class-II immunopeptides while ensuring scalability and reproducibility. The immunopeptides were thereafter subjected to our True Discovery FAIMS-DIA LC-MS\/MS platform which we supported through a specific DDA library and searched the resulting data with Spectronaut (Biognosys) by applying a 1% FDR threshold. We utilized data from WGS on both tumor and adjacent normal tissue for the calling of high-confidence somatic variations (Indivumed) and the definition of the resulting neoantigens. We characterized 131,578 unique immunopeptides from 15 mg of fresh-frozen tumor tissue across 20 patients with CRC lesions that mapped to 12,488 genes. On average we identified 9,767 class-I and 16,445 class-II immunopeptides from all patients indicating significant inter-patient heterogeneity. Overall, we found the identification numbers of class-II immunopeptides to be more variable than that of class-I which might be linked to immune infiltration levels. From our pool of identified immunopeptides, we were able to detect 16 class-I and 29 class-II neoantigens, covering 87% of the microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) samples in the cohort. Coverage of both classes was essential to increase neoantigen discovery as 53% MSI-H samples had neoantigens mapping to a single class. Interestingly we also detected a significant correlation between the mutational burden and the number of detected neoantigens in our patient cohort suggesting that the genetic set up of the cancer might influence the repertoire of presented neoantigens thereby controlling immunosurveillance. In summary, we have established a scalable and efficient pipeline for cell line and tissue immunopeptidomics for both class-I and II immunopeptides. Our pipeline generates high-quality identifications and can be deployed to help shed light on immunopeptidomics heterogeneity through large-scale profiling of patients as exemplified in the case of MSI-H CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,Mass spectrometry,Neoantigens,Colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Ilja  E.

Both missense mutations and gene fusions can serve as targets for cytotoxic T cells, but it is unknown whether one of these classes of mutations has unique parameters that make it more immunogenic. This study compares the immunogenicity of patient-specific missense mutations and a conserved gene fusion, ETV6\/RUNX1, present in approximately 25% of pediatric B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases to determine which is more effective at inducing CD8+ T cell responses. Utilizing patient HLA haplotype, mutation data obtained from whole-genome and mRNA sequencing, and the online prediction algorithm NetMHCcons, we identified several putative neoepitopes. To experimentally validate these predicted neoantigens, we performed peptide exchange assays with antigen presenting beads to evaluate the efficiency of peptide-HLA interactions and complex formation. To further investigate the immunogenicity of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) compared to the conserved gene fusion ETV6\/RUNX1, we assessed peptide-HLA stability by measuring the dissociation of SNV or ETV6\/RUNX1 peptides from the HLA binding groove and calculating the corresponding half-life. Higher affinity peptides would have a greater exchange rate than lower affinity peptides and would have a higher stability\/half-life; these assays validated that ETV6\/RUNX1 has a greater affinity\/stability for HLA-A*02:01 compared to any of the patient-specific SNVs evaluated. To determine whether the higher affinity and stability of the fusion peptide was able to induce greater CD8+ T cell responses, we performed co-culture assays using peptide-pulsed artificial antigen presenting cells expressing HLA-A*02:01 and measured CD8+ T cell cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity. Interestingly, while both mutation types were able to activate CD8+ T cells, those targeting the fusion peptides displayed greater polyfunctionality. Additionally, we found a greater frequency of clonally expanded CD8+ T cells targeting fusion peptides using tetramer-binding assays. Overall, our findings suggest fusion neoantigens have greater immunogenicity than missense mutations and may provide better targets for TCR-T cell-based immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,Antigen presentation,Cytotoxic T cell,HLA class I,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Erin  E.

Out of 79450 MHC-I-associated peptides (MAPs) identified from 19 samples, we found 557 unmutated TAs classified as tumor-specific (TSA), tumor-associated (TAA), or LSAs. These TAs most often derived from annotated open-reading frames, followed by ncRNAs and intergenic regions. By contrast, only 6 MAPs were mutated and tumor-specific, which could be partially explained by a decreased expression of mutations within MAP-generating genomic regions. While the number of unmutated TAs with predicted presentation (TApres) in melanoma patients was similar between responders and non-responders pre-ICB, non-responders showed marks of inefficient antigen presentation. In consequence, only responders lost TApres upon treatment, in tandem with an expansion in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. These results reveal a previously underappreciated contribution of unmutated TAs to tumor control in melanoma and suggest that enhancing their recognition could improve the ICB efficacy in non-responders.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Mass spectrometry,Tumor antigen,Cancer immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anca Apavaloaei<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Qingchuan Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, Leslie Hesnard<sup>1<\/sup>, Krystel Vincent<sup>1<\/sup>, Marie-Pierre Hardy<sup>1<\/sup>, Chantal Durette<sup>1<\/sup>, Joël Lanoix<sup>1<\/sup>, Jean-Philippe Laverdure<sup>1<\/sup>, Jean-David Larouche<sup>1<\/sup>, Maria Virginia Ruiz Cuevas<sup>1<\/sup>, Grégory Ehx<sup>2<\/sup>, Sébastien Lemieux<sup>1<\/sup>, Pierre Thibault<sup>1<\/sup>, Claude Perreault<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Liege, Liege, Belgium","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"18906d1e-e462-4839-ae93-1f8df22094e8","ControlNumber":"4607","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

However, the consequence of tumor hypoxia on antigen processing and presentation to surveilling CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells is a notable knowledge gap with direct relevance towards adaptive immune responses against cancer. Here, we present evidence using the well-established OT-I transgenic model that hypoxia decreases antigen specific T cell effector responses, and importantly, that these decreases in effector responses are not attributable to any hypoxic influence on T cell function. Murine B16 melanoma cells expressing ovalbumin (OVA; MO4) or parental B16 were grown under 20% or 2% oxygen for 48 hours. These cells were then treated with 0 or 10 ng\/mL recombinant murine interferon gamma (IFN-g) for 24 hours at their respective oxygen conditions. For analysis of cytotoxicity and effector responses, these cells were labeled with a fluorescence enhancing ligand (BATDA) and then incubated with OT-I T cells recognizing OVA-peptide (SIINFEKL) presented by C57BL\/6 mouse MHC I (H2kb) for 4 hours at 20% oxygen. Supernatants were then tested for BATDA release using a europium solution and subsequent fluorescent signal acquisition. OT-I T cells displayed significantly more specific lysis of target MO4 cells cultured under 20% oxygen compared to those cultured under 2% oxygen (p value &#60; 0.0001; 2-way ANOVA). Control experiments using parental B16 target cells displayed little to no specific lysis. Additionally, OT-I T cells were incubated with B16 or MO4 cells cultured as described above for 18 hours under 20% oxygen in the presence of protein transport inhibitors and analyzed for effector cytokine production. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) production was significantly increased in OT-I cells co-cultured with IFN-g treated MO4 target cells preconditioned in both 20% and 2% oxygen (p value &#60; 0.05; unpaired T test), however the fold change in TNF-a production for OT-I cells incubated with 20% oxygen cultured MO4 cells was approximately twice the increase observed in OT-I cells incubated with 2% oxygen cultured MO4 cells. These differences are not attributable to altered OVA expression under hypoxia. Furthermore, IFN-g dependent up-regulation of MHC-I and immunoproteasome catalytic subunits was found to be blocked by hypoxia, suggesting that hypoxic attenuation of the MHC I pathway is responsible for observed decreases in cytotoxic and effector responses in OT-I co-culture assays. Overall, these studies suggest that tumor hypoxia blunts anti-tumor immune responses irrespective of the oxygenation status of surveilling CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antigen presentation,Hypoxia,Cytotoxic T cell,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Matthew G.

However, due to a paucity of known tumor antigens in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and osteosarcoma (OS), identification of novel immunogenic antigens is needed. Our group has experience with neutrophil serine proteases (NSP) derived from the azurophilic granules of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), specifically, cathepsin (CG), proteinase 3 (P3), and neutrophil elastase (NE). We have identified two HLA-A2 (HLA-A*0201)-restricted nonameric peptides: CG1 (FLLPTGAEA), derived from CG, and PR1 (VLQELNVTV), derived from NE and P3. We have previously shown that CG1 and PR1 are effective targets in hematological malignancies and that PR1 can be a target for some solid tumor malignancies. Here, we extend our findings to demonstrate that CG1 and PR1 can be immunotherapeutic targets for NSCLC and OS.<br \/>Methods: Healthy donor PMN were isolated from buffy coats using double Ficoll gradient centrifugation. To evaluate uptake, malignant cells were pulsed with PMN lysates, harvested, permeabilized, and stained with anti-CG, anti-NE or anti-P3. To evaluate cross-presentation, cells were cultured with PMN lysates, harvested and stained with CG1 TCR-like antibody, or PR1 TCR-like antibody (8F4). Flow cytometry was performed using the Fortessa X-20 Cell Analyzer. CG1- or PR1-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) were expanded from healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Standard cytotoxicity assays were used to evaluate the lysis of target cells co-cultured with CG1- or PR1-specific CTL.<br \/>Results: We have previously demonstrated that NE and P3 are taken up and cross-presented by NSCLC and become targets for PR1-CTL, thus in this study, we investigate if NSCLC cells take up CG, and whether OS cells take up NE and P3, resulting in enhanced cytotoxicity by peptide-specific CTLs. We first employed The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia to show the absence of NSP&#8217;s in NSCLC and OS cell lines. RT-PCR confirmed lack of endogenous CG mRNA expression in NSCLC and OS, and lack of NE and P3 in OS cell lines. Next, we analyzed antigen cross-presentation and showed that NSCLC cells take up and cross-present CG, leading a 13.3-fold increase in CG1-CTL killing of NSCLC cells pulsed with CG versus non-pulsed cells. In addition, OS cells take up and cross-present NE and P3, with a 13.1-fold increase in PR1-CTL killing of OS cells that were pulsed with NE and P3 vs. non-pulsed cells.<br \/>Conclusion: Our data define two novel HLA-A2 restricted peptides that can be targeted in NSCLC and OS. Specifically, CG1 and PR1 are presented on the surfaces of NSCLC and OS, increasing their susceptibility to killing by CG1 and PR1 specific CTL. Our work represents a novel link between innate and adaptive immune responses in solid tumors and identifies potential antigen targets for CTL, peptide vaccines, and TCR-like antibodies in the setting of NSCLC and OS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,Immunotherapy,Lung cancer,Antigen presentation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Amber Gibson<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Pariya Sukhumalchandra<sup>2<\/sup>, Celine Kerros<sup>2<\/sup>, Na Qiao<sup>2<\/sup>, Anne Philips<sup>2<\/sup>, Mao Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Sami Alkoutami<sup>2<\/sup>, Scott Semelsberger<sup>2<\/sup>, Yoshimi Lu<sup>3<\/sup>, Lauren Byers<sup>4<\/sup>, Ze Tian<sup>5<\/sup>, Chunhua Shi<sup>5<\/sup>, Jun Yan<sup>5<\/sup>, Dongxing Zha<sup>5<\/sup>, Alejandro Marinos<sup>2<\/sup>, Anne Sergeeva<sup>2<\/sup>, Hong He<sup>2<\/sup>, Lisa St. John<sup>2<\/sup>, Jeffrey  J.

Vaccination against tumor antigens is one method being explored to generate immune responses against tumors, and may be particularly effective in conjunction with therapies currently in the clinic, such as checkpoint inhibition. Identification of antigens for use in a vaccine is the pinch point of this method, and many algorithms have been developed in an attempt to predict what epitopes will be both presented and immunogenic. Importantly, both public (common to multiple individuals\/cancer types) and private (single individual) epitopes may contribute to the development of effective vaccines. Experimental identification of presented and immunogenic epitopes is crucial to building effective anti-cancer vaccines. Using immunopeptidome profiling, we have narrowed a collection of published potential neoantigens to those which were presented by MHC class I in the CT26 mouse colorectal cancer cell line. These peptides were synthesized and used to immunize BALB\/c mice. The immunogenicity of the peptide mix was then evaluated by ELIspot to assess IFN-gamma responses in immunized mice. These experiments support a complete workflow for selection of potential cancer neoantigens which experimentally exhibit both MHC presentation and immunogenicity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Cytotoxic T lymphocytes,Immune response,Vaccines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Seeta Nyayapathy<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Richard Jones<sup>2<\/sup>, Michael Ford<sup>2<\/sup>, Micah Doty<sup>1<\/sup>, Julie  M.

While hypoxia is a pervasive feature of solid tumors, it&#8217;s role in tumor antigen processing remains understudied. To assess the effects of reduced oxygen on antigen processing machinery, we used interferon (IFN)-&#947; to induce the expression of the immunoproteasome (IP), a proteasome isoform critical for the tumor antigen processing, in A549 human lung cancer cells cultured under 20% O<sub>2<\/sub>, or 2% O<sub>2<\/sub>. Treatment with IFN-&#947; induced protein expression of IP subunits LMP2, LMP7, and MECL-1 in a dose-dependent manner under 20% O<sub>2<\/sub> as assessed by western blotting. In contrast, IFN-&#947; failed to induce protein expression of these subunits under hypoxic conditions. We observed similar blockades of other antigen processing pathway components in response to IFN-&#947; under hypoxic conditions including TAP, tapasin, and calreticulin, as well as secondary mediators of IFN-&#947;-stimulated genes including several members of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family. Surprisingly, under identical conditions, induction of IP subunit mRNAs appear intact under hypoxia as assessed by RT-PCR, with similar levels of LMP2, LMP7, and MECL-1 upregulated by IFN-&#947; regardless of oxygen level, suggesting hypoxic IP blockade occurs post-transcriptionally or post-translationally. In line with this notion, primary mediators of IFN-&#947; signaling, including phosphorylated (Tyr701) STAT1 levels were unaffected by oxygen levels. To investigate the mechanism behind this phenomenon, we created hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1a and\/or HIF-2a knockout A549 cell lines or used cobalt chloride (CoCl<sub>2<\/sub>), a hydroxylase inhibitor, to directly interrogate the hypoxia signaling pathway. Blockade of IP subunit induction in response to IFN-&#947; was not observed after CoCl<sub>2<\/sub> treatment, nor did HIF-1a and\/or HIF-2a genetic deletion rescue IP subunit blockade in A549 cells cultured under hypoxia, indicating that hypoxia-induced IP blockade is independent of the HIF pathway. To test if this phenomenon is regulated by epigenic means, we treated cells with 5-Azacytidine (5-aza), a cystine analog nucleoside, and observed a re-establishment of IP subunit protein expression under hypoxia in response to IFN-&#947;. Given that 5-aza preferentially integrates RNA over DNA, and that IP subunit mRNA levels appear unaffected by hypoxia, suggests that hypoxia-induced IP blockade may be due to hypoxia-specific cytosine modifications within mRNA transcripts. Current studies include efforts to map mRNA methylation patterns and interrogate mRNA methylation transferases under hypoxic conditions. These studies introduce a novel link between hypoxia and reduced cancer cell antigen processing machinery and may help identify druggable epigenetic targets that can be used to enhance the immunogenicity of hypoxic tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antigen presentation,Hypoxia,HLA class I,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alexis Rebecca Ramos<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Matthew Smith<sup><\/sup>, Heena Panchal<sup><\/sup>, Adam Mailloux<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Microbiology and Immunology, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"52b62111-1db3-44b1-89bb-5de698283419","ControlNumber":"7490","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies have shown promise in treating breast cancer patients but only a small proportion of patients respond to ICB therapy partly due to lack of immune cell infiltration into the tumor. Reduced immune infiltration is a result of downregulation of antigen presentation in the tumor cell by decreasing the levels of antigen-MHC-I (major histocompatibility complex-I) molecules on the tumor cell surface. To investigate pathways upregulated in breast cancer, we performed a paradigm tool analysis (Broad Institute) of RNA expression data using TCGA breast invasive carcinoma datasets and found that signaling events of a small GTPase (SGX) ranked 8th among upregulated pathways. SGX has been implicated in the internalization of MHC-I molecules into the cell. To investigate the effects of SGX on antigen presentation, we generated SGX knockdown EO771 and 4T1 murine and MDA-MB-231 human breast tumor cell lines and measured their antigen presentation by flow cytometry. We observed a significant increase in MHC-I levels upon SGX knockdown. We then performed an antibody internalization assay on SGX knockdown cells where fluorophore-labeled MHC-I antibodies were allowed to internalize for 10 min followed by early endosome isolation. There was a significant reduction of MHC-I antibody-containing early endosomes in SGX knockdown cells. Using a commercially available SGX inhibitor, we tested the pharmacological inhibition of SGX and observed a dose-dependent increase in MHC-I MFI. If a SGX inhibitor was to be administered <i>in vivo<\/i>, we would need to test the impact of inhibitor treatment on CD8+ T cells. To this end, we isolated CD8+ T cells from a C57BL\/6 mouse and pretreated them with the inhibitor, activated them <i>in vitro<\/i> and measured their functionality. Interestingly, inhibitor treatment led to higher IFNg, TNFa and IL-2 production. To explore the possibility of dual SGX inhibition in tumor and T cells, we performed a T cell cytotoxicity assay using EO771 tumor cells and autologous CD8+ T cells and observed increased tumor cell killing when either the tumor cells or T cells were treated with inhibitor. Collectively, we show here that dual SGX inhibition in tumor cells and CD8+ T cells will enhance tumor cell killing due to enhanced antigen presentation and T cell functionality respectively.

Nevertheless, increasing evidence suggests that MHC-II is also expressed by solid tumor cancer cells and may be associated with better immunotherapy responses. However, the regulation of MHC-II in cancer cells remain unclear. In this study, we leveraged data mining and experimental validation to elucidate the regulation of MHC-II in cancer cells and its role in modulating the response to immunotherapy. We collated an extensive collection of omics data to examine the cancer-cell-intrinsic MHC-II expression and its association with immunotherapy outcomes. We then tested the functional relevance of cancer-cell-intrinsic MHC-II expression using a syngeneic transplantation model. Finally, we performed data mining to identify pathways potentially involved in the regulation of MHC-II expression, and experimentally validated candidate regulators. Comprehensive meta-analysis of multiomics data from an exhaustive collection of data revealed that MHC-II is heterogeneously expressed in various solid tumors, and its expression is particularly high in melanoma. Using a syngeneic transplantation model, we further established that melanoma cells with high MHC-II responded better to anti-PD-1 treatment. Data mining followed by experimental validation revealed the Hippo signaling pathway as a potential regulator of melanoma MHC-II expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MHC II,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Antigen presentation,Hippo pathway,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shengqing Gu<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4c740fc6-3fb4-4660-b94b-7f5bdc0d3dd8","ControlNumber":"4441","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

However, non-response mechanisms of immune checkpoint inhibitors generally exist in patients of solid cancer such breast and colorectal cancer. Multiple factors that parallelly regulate T cell functions may cause the non-response mechanism, such as regulators of T-cell&#8217;s recognition of cancer cells and cytotoxicity activities. Our recent study revealed that the presentation and salvage of MHC class I antigen presentation on cancer cells is a key deterministic factor of T-cell recognition in multiple cancer types.<br \/>In this study, we established a systems biology model of the antigen processing and presentation pathways to identify cancer cell-expressing genes that are associated with immune response of breast cancer and effector T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. To the best of our knowledge, there is no established systems biology model of MHC I class antigen presentation pathway. We first manually collected and curated the biological processes that are involved in the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway via an extensive literature review. MHC I class antigen presentation involves a chain of biological processes, namely ubiquitination, proteosome, transporter associated with antigen processing, chaperone-based formation of MHC I class one complex, ER to Golgi, and Golgi to cell membrane exocytosis. We also include branches such as de-ubiquitination, MHC class I complex checking, and endocytosis-based salvage.<br \/>We further estimated sample-wise activity level of the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway using transcriptomics data. By treating antigen as a &#8220;mass carrying&#8221; signal, we developed a systems biology model over the established pathway. The whole biological process was treated as a network model, in which the flux represents antigen presentation activity level. Based on this computational method, we further build a machine-learning pipeline that utilizes omics datasets (cancer genomics, scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics) collected from tumor tissue samples to correlate the MHC class I antigen presentation activities with immune response in cancer tumor microenvironment. We identified genes expressed by cancer cells that have high impacts on antigen presentation and are associated with T cell recognition and cytotoxicity. The identified genes are involved in (a) the antigen presentation machinery, (b) the immunoproteasome in antigen processing, (c) the dynamics of antigen presentation on the cell surface, and (d) cytokine and chemokine secretion.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-09 Tumor antigenicity\/processing and presentation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antigen presentation,Antigen,Machine learning,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jia Wang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Xiao Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Pengtao Dang<sup>2<\/sup>, Haiqi Zhu<sup>1<\/sup>, Xinyu Zhou<sup>1<\/sup>, Kaman So<sup>3<\/sup>, Sha Cao<sup>3<\/sup>, Chi Zhang<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Indiana University, Bloomington, IN,<sup>2<\/sup>Purdue University, Indianapolis, IN,<sup>3<\/sup>Indiana University, School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f37e25f2-79e1-428e-a6c1-fda9b4c24549","ControlNumber":"7039","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Tumor recurrence is virtually inevitable when it is fatal. Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy is a promising new modality of therapy for GBM patients. Even though second-generation CAR-T cells may be considered to operate autonomously because co-stimulation is inherent to CAR design, the tumor microenvironment of GBM is particularly hostile to immune cells and their normal functions. In our recently published work (Gargett et al. J Immunother Cancer 2022; 10(9): e005187), CAR-T cells specific for the glioblastoma antigen, GD2, had improved antitumor activity if the CAR-T cells co-expressed IL-15. Although IL-15 co-expression prolonged control of intracranial tumor xenografts, tumors escaped immune control in most cases. Our early data suggest that a relative lack of intratumoral dendritic cells (DCs) may be a contributory factor. DCs are central to the initiation and maintenance of adaptive immune responses. Hence, we were interested to survey and characterize the DC content of glioblastoma tissues obtained either from human surgical samples or mice bearing orthotopic xenografts and syngrafts. We have used multi-colour flow cytometry to enumerate and evaluate the maturation status of subsets of DCs together with other types of immune cells among single cell suspensions of isolated glioblastoma tissues. Our preliminary findings are: Total DCs (mean +\/- SD), which were defined as lineage-negative and HLA-DR (+), were significantly reduced among total viable cells of glioblastoma tissues (0.845% +\/- 0.569) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (0.755% +\/- 0.601) from GBM patients (n=12) compared to PBMCs (1.77% +\/- 0.611) from healthy donors (n=12).No significant differences were detected in the percentages of total DCs among splenocytes of nontumor-bearing C57BL\/6 (B6) mice (n=6) compared to B6 bearing othotopic syngrafts of the GL261 (n=3) or C2TA (n=3) glioblastoma cell lines. We will present more detailed analyses from human glioblastoma samples. In addition, we will present a more extensive characterization of DCs from the orthotopic murine models of glioblastoma: we will compare DCs and other types of immune cells in tumor and in the primary and secondary lymphoid tissues of both tumor-bearing and nontumor-bearing mice. We expect that the final data will fill a current gap in knowledge and indicate possible therapeutic strategies that might correct for the quantitative and qualitative defects in dendritic cells in glioblastoma. We hypothesize that adequate correction of these defects in vivo may augment the anti-glioblastoma activity of CAR-T cell therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Tumor-induced immune suppression: Intrinsic factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Dendritic cells,Glioblastoma multiforme,Flow cytometry,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Michael P.
