[{"Abstract":"<b>Introduction: <\/b>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death among PWH with a relative risk that is over 3-fold higher compared to the uninfected population. In addition, HIV-infected patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have a significantly worse prognosis. The determinants for these associations remain uncertain.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We investigated the immune contexture of 18 primary NSCLCs from PWH and 19 clinicopathologically matched NSCLCs from HIV-negative cases represented in tissue microarrays using 37-plex Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) panels including cell phenotype markers (CK,CD4,CD8,CD20,CD45RO,CD25,etc), immunomodulatory targets (PD-L1,PD-L2,B7-H3,B7-H4,B2M,etc) and DNA damage response\/repair (DDR) indicators (&#947;H2AX, RAD51,BRCA1,53BP1,etc). The samples were analyzed using single-cell tissue segmentation and spatial analysis. A subset of cases was also studied using whole exome DNA sequencing (WES) and mRNA sequencing (RNAseq).<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>NSCLCs from PWH showed comparable levels of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) relative to HIV-negative cases with a trend towards a lower CD4+\/CD8+ cell ratio. However, CD4+ and CD8+ TILs in PWH showed higher levels of markers associated with T-cell activation and dysfunction including GZB, CD25, Ki-67, PD-1, LAG-3, and TIM-3 than non-HIV tumors. The epithelial tumor cells in HIV-associated cases showed higher levels of the immunomodulatory ligands PD-L1, CD47, B7-H4 and VISTA; and altered levels of the DDR markers &#947;H2AX, BRCA1 and 53BP1 relative to the non-HIV controls. Differences were also seen in tumor-associated macrophages consistent with an immune regulatory environment. The spatial analysis of tumor and immune cells revealed a distinct topographic distribution of these cells in HIV-associated malignancies. WES analysis showed a higher nonsynonymous tumor mutational burden in HIV-associated tumors (400 vs 202 mean mutations\/exome) with increased predicted HLA class-I neoantigens and a numerically higher immunoediting score than the non-HIV group. Exploratory analysis identified enrichment in RYR2 and KIAA1671 gene mutations in HIV-associated malignancies. RNAseq revealed distinct mRNA expression profiles of HIV-positive and negative NSCLCs with a fraction of transcripts showing differential expression associated with tumor suppressor functions, interleukin signaling and DDR.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>NSCLCs in PWH display profound immunological and genomic alterations suggesting defective immunosurveillance. Our study reveals novel characteristics of HIV-associated NSCLC with possible clinical implications for this growing and understudied population.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,HIV,DNA damage response,Immunomodulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Shruti Desai<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Kishu Ranjan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Syim Salahuddin<sup>2<\/sup>, Ramsey Yusuf<sup>2<\/sup>, Jianlei Gu<sup>3<\/sup>, Daiwei Tang<sup>3<\/sup>, Yong Kong<sup>3<\/sup>, Barani Kumar Rajendran<sup>1<\/sup>, Hongyu Zhao<sup>3<\/sup>, Yuval Kluger<sup>1<\/sup>, Sarah Goldberg<sup>2<\/sup>, Brinda Emu<sup>2<\/sup>, Kurt Alex Schalper<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Pathology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Biostatistics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8e6dcc30-202e-4f9e-8d39-09ad8a0aa2e0","ControlNumber":"7582","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

CAFs heterogeneous have been identified by recent single-cell studies. However, their spatial distribution, orgnization patterns and neighbors remain incompletely understood. Deep profiling of CAFs in tissue context may provides new insights into improved understanding of their functions and identify targets for the development of CAF-targeted therapies.We obtained the open-source CosMx SMI dataset generated on 8 tissue sections from 5 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues <i>(He, S.&nbsp;et al. Nat Biotechnol. 2022)<\/i>. We extracted the cells&#8217; spatial locations and transcriptome data for subsequent analyses. Quanlity filtering, data normalization, batch correction and clustering analysis was performed by Seurat package. Cell type was defined based on canonical immune markers and curated gene sets. In addition, we applied NMF clustering approach to define the spatial subtypes of CAFs based on the composition of neighboring cells. After that, Four spatial subtypes of CAFs were defined, exhibiting distinct spatial distribution patterns and compositions of neiboring cells, including CAFs that are clustered with tumor cells, CAFs localized within stromal, CAFs co-localized with B cells and T cells within the tertiary lymphoid structures, and CAFs localized within myeloid-enriched areas. Notably, we observed an intimate link between their spatial location and tarnscriptioanl states, i.e., these different spatial CAF subtypes showed clearly distinct expression profiles, may suggest their heterogeneous functions in the tumor microenviroment. For example, tumor-enriched CAFs showed high expression of contractile (e.g., <i>ACTA2, TAGLN<\/i>) and extracellular matrix (<i>COL1A1<\/i>) related genes, resembling myofibroblast (myCAFs), whereas the TLS-niches CAFs showed high expression of genes involved in antigen presentation such as major histocompatibility complex class II molecules and CD74, suggesting their antigen presentation function and were identified as apCAFs. Consistently, we observed high expression of inflammation related genes such as interleukin and PDGFRA in the myeloid-enriched CAFs suggesting an inflammatory phenotype (iCAFs). In addition, these CAFs in different spatial subtypes showed differential expression of molecular pathways<br \/>regulating stress and inflammation response, likely reflecting their complex interactions with other components of the tunmor microenvironment. We also included single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatially resolved whole transcriptomics datasets for cross validation of our novel discoveries in additional cohorts.In summary, by applying a novel approach to classify CAFs in the spatial context, this study provided novel insights into an improved understanding of the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of CAFs in the tunmor microenvironment of NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer associated fibroblasts,Single cell,Biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yunhe Liu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Guangchun Han<sup><\/sup>, Enyu Dai<sup><\/sup>, Guangsheng Pei<sup><\/sup>, Jiahui Jiang<sup><\/sup>, Humam Kadara<sup><\/sup>, Linghua Wang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d0736772-a2ec-4397-b5de-10c9508f17bf","ControlNumber":"7566","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Complementing this work with multi-omic Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes (CITE-seq), which adds barcoded antibodies to label the surface of isolated cells, allows us to additionally characterize surface proteins. While information gleaned from these studies is dramatically expanding our understanding of the evolving immune response and tumor-immune interactions, it lacks an appreciation of the many spatial relationships that are present within the TME. Spatial phenotyping with the power of single cell resolution and whole slide imaging provides a valuable tool for identifying the cellular architecture and organization of spatial neighborhoods that perform critical roles in tumor progression, resistance, and clinical responses. Here, we explore bioinformatic strategies aimed at combining scRNA-seq and CITE-seq data with single-cell spatial protein data obtained with the PhenoCycler-Fusion (PCF) imaging platform. To this end, we performed whole-slide spatial phenotyping with an ultrahigh-plex PCF panel on FFPE human head and neck tumors. The same biopsies were also enzymatically digested and subjected to CITE-seq and scRNA-seq analysis. The combined multi-omic, single cell dataset provides a uniquely comprehensive account of the cellular states, functional significance and spatial neighborhoods that govern the TME. This study represents a novel approach to integrate high dimensional data from bulk tissue and single-cell spatial technologies to provide deeper insights into tumor biology and, in turn, to develop more informed strategies for combination immunotherapy trials and improved patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiomics,Fluorescence imaging,Single cell,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Aditya Pratapa<sup>1<\/sup>, Shawn M.

To treat patients that evade immune therapy, comprehensive understanding of their tumor microenvironment (TME) is needed. To date, most profiling efforts have lacked the ability to capture high-plex &#8216;omics data while retaining the spatial architecture of the TME. We developed the CosMx&#8482; Spatial Molecular Imager (SMI) for analyzing formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) or fresh-frozen (FF) tissue and capturing the expression of over 1000 RNA targets simultaneously with subcellular resolution from a single histopathology slide. We profiled a cohort of 16 slides with CosMx using the Human Universal Cell Characterization (UCC) Panel across a range of solid tumors. This cohort represents a diverse array of patients which include both infiltrated and excluded tumors. We included technical replicates for 5 of the samples to better understand reproducibility of the assay. We were able to characterize over 4.5 million cells and detected on average over 80% of the panel per patient and assigning more than 95% of the transcripts profiled to unique cells across these samples. We were able to robustly identify more than 20 cell types by integrating our data with previous single-cell sequencing projects from the human cell atlas. We demonstrate robust delineation of critical immune cell populations from across lymphoid and myeloid lineages, as well as stromal cell populations inclusive of cell types frequently missed using dissociated cell sequencing, such as vascular endothelium associated with immune cell migration into the tumor bed. We leveraged 450+ genes from our panel dedicated to cell lineage, cell-cell interaction, and ligand-receptor signaling to identify unique interactions occurring at different scales between the tumor and the TME. We find that diverse mechanisms of immune evasion can be captured, and a clear role for cell types such as SPP1+ Macrophages emerges in multiple cancer types. Utilizing the CosMx platform to profile tissues allows for robust resolution of critical immunogenic signaling cascades and cellular interactions that are necessary to truly understand the tumor architecture. By maintaining the tissue structure, we can directly measure cellular interactions and capture cells commonly missed during dissociative studies. With this new platform, we are better poised than ever to truly understand the molecular mechanisms that drive tumor response to intervention. FOR RESEARCH USE ONLY.

However, only a minority of patients experience durable clinical benefit and increasing evidence has linked the efficacy of ICIs to tumor cell heterogeneity, the complex tumor immune microenvironment and their interactions, which remains poorly understood, particularly in the tissue context. Recent advances in spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) has provided great opportunity to better understand spatial tumor-immune interactions. In this study, we obtained public and in-house SRT data on a total of 136 tissue sections across 11 different cancer types, representing to date, the largest collection of SRT on human cancer. Sample and spot-level quality filters were applied, batch effects were assessed and properly handled. High-quality SRT data were pre-processed uniformly to comprehensively interrogate the spatial heterogeneity and architectures of the 3 major compartments (malignant, stroma, and immune) as well as relationships among them. Transcriptome data was integrated with region- and\/or spot-level annotations from pathologists. For regions enriched with malignant cells, we inferred somatic copy number alterations, clonal structure of tumor cells, and profiled the transcriptional hallmarks of intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) including a number of curated gene sets and meta-programs, and systematically characterized tumor cell heterogeneity under the spatial modality. We observed a great variation in aneuploidy levels and transcriptome profiles within and across patients and cancer types and notably in molecular processes regulating tumor cell responses to stress, hypoxia and interferon signals and other key processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In addition, we performed cell-type deconvolution analysis using available tools including RCTD and cell2location, based on expression of curated cell-type specific gene signatures, we inferred levels of immune infiltration in each tissue section in both tumor core and invasive edges, and classified tumors into &#8220;cold&#8221;, &#8220;warm&#8221;, &#8220;hot&#8221;, and &#8220;mixed&#8221; immune phenotypes.

The objective response rate (ORR) to inhibition of PD1\/PDL1 used as single agents observed in TLS-positive NSCLC is similar to ORRs observed in all-comers NSCLC treated with a combination of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) and chemotherapy. However, a substantial proportion of patients with TLS-positive NSCLC did not display clinical benefit. The aim of our study was to identify the determinants of response to ICI in TLS-positive NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: We spatially profiled the expression of &#62;18,000 protein-coding genes across six patients with mature TLS-positive NSCLC (three with objective response and three with progressive disease as the best response) using the GeoMx whole-transcriptome atlas (WTA) assay. Using two consecutive slides stained with CD3\/CD20 and CD45\/PanCK markers, a first set of regions of interest (ROIs) selected the TLS (CD3+\/CD20+) as an entire area of illumination (AOIs). A second set of ROIs was selected outside the TLS region and further segmented into &#8216;tumor&#8217; (PanCK+\/CD45-) versus &#8216;stroma&#8217; (PanCK-\/CD45+) AOIs. To further validate our findings, we performed multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) on 70 mature TLS-positive NSCLC tumors.<br \/>Results: Comparative transcriptomic analysis of TLS between non-responders and responders revealed upregulation in responders of CCL21 which plays a crucial role in T cell recruitment, and of IGHM indicating the presence of unswitched B cells. Outside of TLS, in the stromal compartment, the most significantly differentially expressed genes between responders and non-responders were those belonging to a subset of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) expressing both FAP and &#945;SMA markers, and recently described as linked to more inflammatory activated immune cells and involved in T cell exclusion in NSCLC. We then used FFPE tissue mIF to histologically profile CAF subset composition and spatial distribution of T cells in a cohort of 70 mature TLS-positive NSCLC. In tumor lesions enriched in FAP+&#945;SMA+ CAFs, the tumor-to-stroma ratio of infiltrating CD8+ cells was significantly lower, consistent with a decreased infiltrating CD8+ T cell density in the tumor. Strikingly, ORR and survival of patients with mature TLS NSCCLC enriched in FAP+&#945;SMA+ CAFs were significantly lower than those of patients with low abundance of CAFs.<br \/>Conclusions: We report here the first study investigating the mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy in TLS-positive tumors. Our analysis of human tumor samples suggests a crucial role of FAP+&#945;SMA+ CAFs in excluding T cells and in driving resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition in mature TLS-positive NSCLC. The development of novel CAF-targeting strategies may be particularly relevant in this subset of tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Fibroblasts,Immune checkpoint blockade,NSCLC,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Florent Peyraud<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jean-Philippe Guegan<sup>2<\/sup>, Christophe Rey<sup>2<\/sup>, Oren Ngouala<sup>2<\/sup>, Ophélie Odin<sup>2<\/sup>, Emma Clot<sup>1<\/sup>, Lucile Vanhersecke<sup>1<\/sup>, Maxime Brunet<sup>1<\/sup>, Thomas Grellety<sup>3<\/sup>, Marie Del Castillo<sup>4<\/sup>, Sylvestre Le Moulec<sup>5<\/sup>, François Le Loarer<sup>1<\/sup>, Alban Bessede<sup>2<\/sup>, Antoine Italiano<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Institute Bergonié, Bordeaux, France,<sup>2<\/sup>Explicyte, Bordeaux, France,<sup>3<\/sup>Centre Hospitalier de la Côte Basque, Bayonne, France,<sup>4<\/sup>Atlantic Pathologie, Saint Pierre d'Irube, France,<sup>5<\/sup>Clinique Marzet, Pau, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a4b9fa77-bd73-4c7c-9316-41a60b71e3af","ControlNumber":"4624","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

Whilst immunotherapies have led to durable and prolonged survival, only a subset of patients remain responsive. Additional biomarkers are thus needed to better predict if patients will respond or develop resistance against immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies. Spatial phenotyping of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is now recognized as a proxy for ICI therapy outcomes. Our study employs an end-to-end spatial biology strategy to survey non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues for new biomarkers that could guide immunotherapy treatments.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>We phenotyped pre-treatment biopsies from non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with single-agent Nivolumab. We first performed 57-plex whole-slide Single Cell Spatial Phenotyping on the PhenoCycler&#174;-Fusion platform. Next, we developed the spatial analysis of a larger NSCLC cohort using customizable PhenoCode Signature Panels (PSP) for high-throughput immune profile (CD3\/CD8\/CD20\/CD68\/PanCK + CD4 add-in) and immuno-contexture (CD8\/CD68\/PD-L1\/FoxP3\/PanCK + PD-1 add-in) imaging. The PSP panel content combines the barcode-based antibody chemistry from the PhenoCycler platform with the signal amplification of Opal chemistry from the PhenoImager platform. PSP panels were profiled across n=27 NSCLC biopsies and provided a wider breadth of tissue profiling.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>Our whole-slide single-cell spatial phenotyping analyses revealed high phenotypic diversity in the TME of patients responsive and resistant to ICI therapy. However, higher-throughput analyses of the same tissues using targeted PSP panels revealed no significant differences in quantities of immune cell lineages, including T-cells and macrophages. On the contrary, we discovered multiple quantifiable and statistically significant spatial signatures that appear to be predictive of treatment benefit, which confirms the potential biomarker value of spatial associations in patient tissues.<br \/><b>Conclusions <\/b>This study amounts to a uniquely comprehensive Single Cell Spatial Phenotyping analysis of pre-treatment NSCLC biopsies from a single-agent Nivolumab study. Our data catalogue the diversity in the immune microenvironment of NSCLC but highlighted that immune cell quantification is insufficient to stratify patient cohorts. Single-cell spatial phenotyping, on the other hand, promises to reveal new biomarkers that may aid in better stratification of patients in pre-treatment evaluations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nivolumab,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Spatial Phenotyping,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ning Ma<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Aditya Pratapa<sup>1<\/sup>, James Monkman<sup>2<\/sup>, Ken O’Byrne<sup>3<\/sup>, Oliver Braubach<sup>1<\/sup>, Arutha Kulasinghe<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Akoya Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia,<sup>3<\/sup>Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"52870820-7df9-400d-be38-5a30ac100cdb","ControlNumber":"6958","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;N.

As a result of plex limitations, key insights about tumor biology are missed, which could be important for advancing our understanding of tumor biology and ultimately improving patient outcomes.<b> <\/b>Chip Cytometry is a novel image-based platform for precise spatial multiplexing that addresses these challenges by combining iterative immuno-fluorescent staining with high-dynamic range imaging to facilitate quantitative phenotyping with single-cell resolution. The platform enables simultaneous detection of dozens of markers on a single tissue section and enables accurate quantification of protein expression levels necessary to deeply profile single cells, understand interactions between key immune cells, and identify topographic biomarkers. Here we demonstrate how standard FCS files are generated from multichannel OME TIFF images, enabling identification of cellular phenotypes via flow cytometry-like hierarchical gating. Quantification of results reveal precise expression levels for each marker in the assay in each individual cell in the sample, while maintaining spatial information about each cell. Chip Cytometry has the potential to advance precision medicine in immuno-oncology and inform the discovery of novel biomarkers by enabling quantitative analysis of cellular phenotypes in the spatial context. The Chip Cytometry platform enables simultaneous detection of multiple protein markers on a single tissue section for deep immune cell profiling in the tumor microenvironment.

Tissue heterogeneity poses immense challenges to understanding underlying molecular mechanisms using techniques such as qRT-PCR or bulk sequencing. While single-cell RNA sequencing can provide information about precise cellular composition of tissues, data analysis can be cumbersome and spatial context is lost. With single-cell spatial platforms such as RNAscope, target gene and protein expression can be visualized to characterize cell types and tissue neighborhoods. Here, we demonstrate a novel method for the simultaneous detection of RNA and protein using a modified co-detection assay. This novel co-detection assay enables visualization of a combination of up to 12 RNA and\/or protein targets on the same sample. We used a set of antibodies targeting key immune and tumor cell markers- PD1, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD68, FOXP3 and KRT17, along with RNA biomarkers to interrogate the tumor microenvironment (TME) in human FFPE tumor samples. Using a combination of RNA and protein targets, we characterized different cell types such as T cells, macrophages, and tumor cells in the TME. We also developed a novel method for visualizing intercellular interactions between PD1 and PD-L1, offering insights into popular checkpoint mechanisms that are targeted for therapeutic intervention in cancer treatment. The assay offers a powerful technique for visualizing target RNA biomarkers in specific cell-types identified by cell-marker protein expression. This is a valuable tool for multi-omic analysis and accurate interrogation of complex tissues to obtain insights into novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytotoxic T cell,Single cell,In situ hybridization,Cytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anushka Dikshit<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sayantani Basak<sup><\/sup>, Vasudha Murlidhar<sup><\/sup>, Ge-Ah Kim<sup><\/sup>, Julia Yu<sup><\/sup>, Sonali Deshpande<sup><\/sup>, Li-Chong Wang<sup><\/sup>, Maithreyan Srinivasan<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Bio-Techne Corporation, Newark, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0c4b8a17-87d3-4c60-8739-99bed821094b","ControlNumber":"3959","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;A.

It finds versatile applications in basic research, understanding of cellular processes, visualization of tissue architecture, and identification of biomarkers, among others. However, standard IF and isPLA techniques alike may suffer from high background. Tissues are particularly affected by background problems caused by autofluorescence and tissue infiltration of various cell types (e.g., immune, endothelial) where the fluorescently labelled oligos used for detection in isPLA may bind unspecifically. To address this, we developed a next generation isPLA-based technology for fluorescent detection of protein interactions in FFPE and fresh frozen human and mouse tissues, called NaveniFlex Tissue. In contrast to previously available protocols, it can visualize signal that would otherwise be obscured by background, thereby increasing sensitivity. Here, we compare the ability of NaveniFlex Tissue and similar commercial kits to detect the interaction between low abundance proteins Podocalyxin and Ezrin in the glomeruli of healthy kidney and in breast cancer, where co-expression is a prognostic marker for increased metastatic potential. While other kits generate high background which masks isPLA signal entirely, NaveniFlex Tissue dramatically reduces cell-based background and visualizes the interaction in its specific localization. Furthermore, in a TMA staining for the Mucin 16\/Mesothelin interaction, our method successfully demonstrates strong and clear signal in stage III ovarian cancer. Moreover, it sensitively detects even low abundance interaction in a stage Ia tumor. In contrast, a different commercial kit detects significantly less interactions in the stage III tumor, while in the lower grade tumor it does not generate signals above background level. Therefore, NaveniFlex Tissue improves detection in tissues with varying disease progression, thus adding information and prognostic value to the staining. Taken together, our data illustrate that NaveniFlex Tissue outperforms current isPLA-based techniques by efficiently reducing background, which improves visualization of signal and signal-to-noise ratios in various healthy and diseased tissues.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Protein-protein interactions,Tumor markers,ovarian cancer,Fluorescence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Hampus Elofsson<sup><\/sup>, <b>Doroteya Raykova<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Agata Zieba Wicher<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Navinci Diagnostics AB, Uppsala, Sweden","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8494e120-b453-4b9b-b110-9b00dfadb2b6","ControlNumber":"6733","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;H.

However, most of these studies have used bulk or dissociation-based single-cell technologies to draw their biological insights. Lately, new spatial -omics technologies are increasing our knowledge on this population by adding the spatial location of these cells in-situ in the native structure of the tissue. In this study, we have compared the activation of Tcy in reactive and cancerous conditions at single cell level and in the micro-anatomical context of the tissue.<br \/><b>Experimental procedures <\/b>One tissue micro array slide containing: reactive tonsil, inflammatory liver disease, breast cancer, glioblastoma and melanoma was stained using the COMET&#8482; instrument (Lunaphore Technologies SA) for a multiplex panel of 20 markers. The derived multiplexed images were analyzed using the DISSCOVERY software platform developed by the MILAN Unit at KU Leuven (Belgium). 12\/20 markers were specifically aimed at identifying the main cell populations in the tissue (CD11b, CD163, CD20, CD3, CD31, CD4, CD56, CD68, CD8, CK, FOXP3, S100) while the remaining 8 markers were aimed at adding functional information on immune cell types of interest (CD69, HLA-DR, Ki67, LAG3, OX40, PD-1, PD-L1, TIM3).<br \/><b>Results <\/b>The general activation levels of the Tcy in the reactive conditions were higher than in the three cancer subtypes. When looking at Tcy activation as a function of the distance from the vascular structures (identified via CD31+ endothelial cells), we observed an orderly distribution of activated Tcy around CD31+ endothelial cells with a gradient of increasing exhaustion levels with increasing distance from the vessel in the reactive conditions. In the cancer samples, on the contrary, a patchy disorderly organized pattern of exhausted and activated Tcy was observed around the vessels.<br \/><b>Conclusion <\/b>The spatial location of inflammatory cells plays a critical role to understand their functional behavior and thanks to technological progress it is now possible to start doing this at scale. The study of the dynamics of exhaustion of Tcy in the tissue will help clarify the interplay between cancer cells and immune environment. These results will be crucial to better select patients who may benefit the most of immune check point blockade.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Glioblastoma,Multiplexing,Spatial proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maxim De Schepper<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Asier Antoranz<sup>2<\/sup>, Nikolina Dubroja<sup>2<\/sup>, Giuseppe Floris<sup>2<\/sup>, Frederik De Smet<sup>2<\/sup>, Francesca Bosisio<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Laboratory for translational breast cancer research, Department of Oncology, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium,<sup>2<\/sup>Translational Cell and Tissue Research, Department of Imaging and Pathology, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a7eeba98-7433-4b97-8e2e-a5e865f4b1d4","ControlNumber":"6389","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

Approximately 50% of cSCC patients develop primary resistance and 20% will develop secondary resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). There are limited biomarkers that reflect the tumor dynamics predictive of response to ICI therapy, and therefore we need to explore new biomarkers that can better understand the cSCC tumor microenvironment (TME).<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Our retrospective study profiled pre-treatment cutaneous skin cancer tissues from patients with immunotherapy sensitive and resistant diseases. In this exploratory study, we designed a high-dimensional &#62; 50-plex antibody panel identifying cell lineages, activation states, and immune checkpoints. In addition, we deployed a combination of antibodies for a novel multiplexed metabolic readout, to enhance our <i>in situ<\/i> profiling beyond well-known TME targets. Whole-slide spatial phenotyping was conducted on the PhenoCycler-Fusion spatial biology platform. Highplex image analysis was performed using Phenoplex (Visiopharm), including tissue segmentation and cellular phenotyping.

Additionally, a comparison of the phenotypic expression patterns between immunotherapy sensitive and resistant cohorts in the tumor, stromal and margin regions showed relevant differences in the immune content. Taken together, this high-dimensional imaging approach of the cSCC TME has revealed new tissue insights.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>There is a need to understand the contexture of the cSCC immune microenvironment.

Moreover, the tumoral heterogeneity and its spatial distribution remain important obstacles in predicting tumor evolution and treatment responses. In recent years, genomic spatial profiling techniques have shed light on this complexity by detecting gene expression changes in heterogenous tumor regions and their microenvironment over the course of treatment.<br \/>Methods: Tepotinib is a highly selective and potent MET class Ib inhibitor, approved for the treatment of patients with NSCLC with <i>MET<\/i> exon 14 skipping alterations. To detect genomic changes during neoadjuvant treatment with tepotinib, a GeoMx&#174; digital spatial profiler (DSP; Nanostring Technologies) analysis was conducted in paired baseline and on-treatment patient samples. GeoMx&#174; DSP was performed by selecting regions of interest with nuclear, TTF-1, CD3 and CD33 morphology markers followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas RNA panel (&#62;1,800 cancer-related genes).<br \/>Results: Following a poor response to chemotherapy, neoadjuvant tepotinib treatment was initiated in a 54-year-old female, never-smoker with NSCLC harboring a <i>MET<\/i> exon 14 alteration. Owing to a good response to tepotinib, surgical resection of the tumor was decided by the tumor board given the downgrading (from IIIB to IA1) and resulting in a major pathological response. This resection allowed spatial transcriptomics to be compared to a baseline biopsy from the same patient. MET signaling inhibition by tepotinib treatment increased immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment compared to the baseline sample. This enhanced tumoral immune cell density was shown by the fluorescent morphology markers and confirmed through spatial deconvolution of the NGS results. It was further characterized by the significantly altered gene expression levels between the two samples. Gene ontology (GO) assessment of the differentially expressed genes revealed GO terms associated with tumorigenesis in the basal sample, such as cell mobility and motility, vascular epithelial growth factor production and cell communication. In turn, the tepotinib-treated tissue mainly exhibited tumor-clearing characteristics, including antigen processing and presentation through major histocompatibility complex classes I &#38; II, T cell-mediated toxicity, and granulocyte and leukocyte activation.<br \/>Conclusion: This is the first spatial genomic characterization of the effect of tepotinib on the tumor and its microenvironment in a patient with NSCLC over time. Results from this case report highlight the impact of MET inhibition by tepotinib on the tumor immune microenvironment, likely enabling the recruitment of antigen-presenting cells for tumor clearance, while reducing the expression of tumor-promoting genes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Tumor microenvironment,Targeted therapy,Profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Manon A.

Further, only a limited percentage of melanoma or lung cancer (MBM\/NSCLC)-brain metastasis (BrMs) patients respond to IO. The aim of this study is to explore the differences in the tumor microenvironment (TME) among BrMs from different tumor types including melanoma, NSCLC, breast, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC).<br \/>Methods: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor from 13 MBM and 43 non-MBM [18 NSCLC-BrMs, 20 breast-BrMs and 5 Renal RCC-BrMs] and primary tissue from 7 melanoma, 4 NSCLC and 3 breast cases were identified. RNA was isolated from tumor regions and subjected to whole gene expression profiling (GEP) by RNA-seq. Microenvironment Cell-Populations counter method estimated the abundance of immune and stromal infiltrated cell subpopulations. Inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity was evaluated in selected regions of interest using a 59-plex immune related protein panel assessed by GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) technology.<br \/>Results: Whole GEP revealed 3650 transcripts differentially expressed between MBM and non-MBM (False Discovery Rate, FDR, &#8804;0.01). MBM showed increased expression of genes involved in B cell function, cytolytic activity associated with CD8 and NK cells and complement signaling (<i>C1QA<\/i>\/<i>B<\/i>\/<i>C<\/i>). Conversely, overexpression of genes involved in epithelial signaling, cell adhesion and neurovascular coupling was observed in non MBM vs MBM. Spatial protein profiling revealed in the TME of MBM vs non-MBM, an increased expression (p &#60;0.1, FC&#62;1.5) of the tumor antigen MART-1, together with a higher infiltration of CD8+ cytotoxic cells (CD8<sup>+<\/sup>, 41BB<sup>+<\/sup>), antigen presenting cells (HLA-DR<sup>+<\/sup>, B2M<sup>+<\/sup>, CD40<sup>+<\/sup>) and cells involved in the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (CD20<sup>+<\/sup>, CD11c<sup>+<\/sup>). Conversely, increased infiltration of Tregs (CD25<sup>+<\/sup>, CD127<sup>+<\/sup>), neutrophils (CD66b<sup>+<\/sup>) and epithelial cells (EpCAM<sup>+<\/sup>, PanCK<sup>+<\/sup>) was observed in non-MBM vs MBM. Interestingly, LAG3<sup>+<\/sup>and PD-L2<sup>+<\/sup>cells were also observed to be more enriched in non-MBM vs MBM. GEP in primary tumors (FDR&#8804;0.01) showed limited immune-related signals but revealed overexpression of genes associated with NK cells functions and immune chemoattraction (<i>CCL18<\/i>\/<i>20<\/i>, <i>CXCL2<\/i>\/<i>5<\/i>\/<i>17<\/i>) to be overexpressed in PM vs other primary tumors.<br \/>Conclusion: TME interrogation at molecular and protein levels has shown that MBM are more immune infiltrated than brain metastases derived from non-melanoma solid tumors. Particularly, a cytotoxic and B cells - enriched TME was observed in MBM vs brain metastases derived from NSCLC, breast and RCC. These findings will be validated in larger cohorts and incorporated in therapeutic investigations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain metastasis,Tumor microenvironment,Immunotherapy,Intratumoral heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alberto Mendoza-Valderrey<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Daria  M.

Understanding the immunopathogenesis of CRC particularly within the spatial context of tumor microenvironment (TME) may elucidate the genomic and biological changes to improve patient prognosis for adjuvant therapies and identifying potential drug targets. However, this can be challenging, as genomic signatures from sub-cellular populations and varying levels of immune cell infiltration in TME may be lost in bulk sequencing. In this study, we used the NanoString GeoMx<sup>&#174; <\/sup>Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) to spatially select epithelial, proximal stromal and distal stromal regions of TMEs on a total of 10 FFPE samples (5 colon cancer patients and 5 healthy donor samples) and profiled up to 1,800 genes included in the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas (CTA) panel.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>:<b> <\/b>Selection of regions of interest (ROI) were guided by pathology assessment of H&#38;E images and fluorescent markers (CD45, PanCK, Syto13). Tumor and stroma (proximal and distal) regions were profiled through geometric ROI selection in PanCK+ (epithelial) and CD45+ (stromal\/immune) enriched areas respectively, followed by collection of indexed oligonucleotides and sequencing on NextSeq 550 Illumina instrument. Differential expression and pathways enrichment analyses was performed using R BioConductor package DESeq2 and DSP GeoMx analysis suite. A subset of samples were tested for bulk RNA expression using PanCancer IO360 panel on NanoString nCounter Flex system and data analyzed using nSolver software 3.0 and TIS algorithm App.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: The CTA panel is designed to profile the global immune response and all aspects of tumor microenvironment biology. From differential gene expression analysis of epithelial and distal\/proximal stromal ROIs, we have identified biomarkers such as SOX9, IRAK2 and NLRP3 that are specifically upregulated in CRC samples compared to the healthy cohort. Comprehensive pathways analysis revealed an over activation of NF-kB signaling, extracellular matrix organization and interferon signaling pathways in the CRC cohort. Suppression of the NF-kB signaling pathway is a potential therapeutic approach in the treatment of colon cancer.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: With this spatial study using GeoMx CTA panel, we have highlighted key genes and pathways involved in CRC in order to provide a much-needed understanding of the underlying mechanisms as well as immune signatures in the development of colon cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Colon cancer,Transcription,Inflammatory bowel disease,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xiang Li<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Qinqin Zha<sup>1<\/sup>, Brigitte Lovell<sup>2<\/sup>, Jane Reed<sup>2<\/sup>, Anna Juncker-Jensen<sup>1<\/sup>, Tricia Peters<sup>2<\/sup>, Lakshmi Chandramohan<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>NeoGenomics, Aliso Viejo, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>NeoGenomics, Houston, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"be519d06-200b-4c91-a611-d8ece2adfb96","ControlNumber":"5347","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;X.

These lethal brain tumors are characterized by the inter- and intra-tumor molecular heterogeneity and diverse cell plasticity. We sought to interrogate the immune landscape of GBM, tease out the distinct biological and therapeutic niches in GBM and to understand how the tumor microenvironments mediated the heterogeneity of GBM. We have collected six human GBM samples for spatial profiling and single-nucleus RNA sequencing. Multiple sets of spatial gene panels were designed to capture the cell identities (cancer stem cells, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, macrophages, endothelial cells, etc.) and the spatially-resolved expression patterns of genes indicative of different functional states. We also aim to find altered neurovascular units by examining the spatial correlation between cells that highly express angiogenesis markers such as VEGFA with tumor-associated macrophages, which could be recruited to the angiogenic niche by GBM tumor cells. From the spatial RNA dataset of the first two samples, we observed close proximity of tumor-associated macrophages and endothelial cells that form the microvasculature. Our preliminary results from the single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics of two samples shed light on the complex cell landscape and the dynamic interaction between tumor cells and infiltrating or resident immune cells in the GBM tumor tissue.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma multiforme,Spatial transcriptomics,Single nucleus transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yue Hao<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Angela Baker<sup>1<\/sup>, Brian Hilbush<sup>2<\/sup>, Marcos Otero<sup>2<\/sup>, Chris Streck<sup>2<\/sup>, Karen L.

This study was conducted to explore the heterogeneity of TME through multiplex IHC, spatial and RNA sequencing analysis. We selected a sample from a lung adenocarcinoma patient without EGFR-activating mutation and expressing 30% of PD-L1. For quantitative analysis by multiplex IHC, various markers including CD4, CD8, FoxP3, granzyme B, CD20 and pan-cytokeratin were stained with 7 different fluorescence dyes, which was imaged with Vectra Polaris (Akoya). For scRNAseq and spatial RNAseq, we used 5&#8217; chromium library kit (10X Genomics) to make library construction. Integrated raw data was generated using Cell ranger, Seurat pipeline and Azimuth package. The tumor area was divided into 16 clusters in which we selected 2 clusters based on CD3\/45 expression. There was a noticeable distinction between the two clusters which were defined as the &#8216;High&#8217; region (CD45<sup>high<\/sup>CD3<sup>high<\/sup> cluster) and the &#8216;Low&#8217; region (CD45<sup>low<\/sup>CD3<sup>low<\/sup> cluster). By multiplex IHC, percentage of CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells was higher in the &#8216;High&#8217; region than in the &#8216;Low&#8217; region (8.5% vs. 0.8%, respectively). Subsequent analysis of two clusters using spatial and single cell RNA seq, the &#8216;Low&#8217; region was characterized by increased hypoxia-associated gene expressions including HIF1A, HIF3A and VEGFA. Various immune cells were abundant in the &#8216;High&#8217; region and CD45 expression level was 11-fold higher in the &#8216;High&#8217; region compared to the &#8216;Low&#8217; region. Cytokine\/chemokine<u> <\/u>network analysis via spatial RNAseq revealed that gene expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family-associated factors increased in the 'High' region compared to the &#8216;Low&#8217; region (TNF, FAS, TRAIL, RANKL and CD40), which is well-known to promotes apoptosis, programmed cell death, or necrosis of certain cancer. Additionally, the &#8216;High&#8217; region also had elevated levels of the PD-1\/PD-L1, CD155, CD122\/TIGIT, Siglec10\/CD24, LAG3\/LAGLS3, and CD47\/CD172a axes, suggesting active immune responses. Intriguingly, combined analyses showed that &#8216;High&#8217; region showed enhanced level of <i>CD44<\/i> expression as the leading-edged gene, which suggests the metastatic potential of tumor cells. Furthermore, scRNA analysis confirmed that <i>CD44<\/i> expression was mainly higher in macrophages, suggesting that tumor-associated macrophages partially affected tumor cell metastasis in the &#8216;High&#8217; region. Our finding suggests that understanding the intratumoral immunological heterogeneity of lung adenocarcinoma can help to study the mechanism of tumor heterogeneity by integrated spatial RNAseq and scRNAseq analyses. This type of technique could be applied to understand complex networks of anti-tumor immune activities, drug resistance mechanisms and immunotherapeutic response of cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Immuno-oncology,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Seul Lee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jae-Hwan Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Kwangmin Na<sup>2<\/sup>, Seung Min Yang<sup>2<\/sup>, Dong Kwon Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Sujeong Baek<sup>3<\/sup>, Seong-san Kang<sup>4<\/sup>, Yu Jin Han<sup>2<\/sup>, Chun-Bong Synn<sup>1<\/sup>, Mi hyun Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Heekyung Han<sup>2<\/sup>, Young Taek Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Sungwoo Lee<sup>4<\/sup>, Youngseon Byeon<sup>2<\/sup>, Young Seob Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Ji Yun Lee<sup>5<\/sup>, Jii Bum Lee<sup>5<\/sup>, Chang Gon Kim<sup>5<\/sup>, Min Hee Hong<sup>5<\/sup>, Sun Min Lim<sup>5<\/sup>, Kyoung-Ho Pyo<sup>2<\/sup>, Byoung Chul Cho<sup>5<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Brain Korea 21 PLUS Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Severance Biomedical Science Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Severance Biomedical Science Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>JEUK Institute for Cancer Research, JEUK Co., Ltd, Gumi-city, Korea, Republic of,<sup>5<\/sup>Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine and Yonsei Cancer Center, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2214da93-fbd0-47b0-9503-f2e27d9ca772","ControlNumber":"5745","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Revealing genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and epitranscriptomic features that are unique to the malignant cell populations within cancer lead to cancer biomarker discoveries that can be translated into diagnostic or therapeutic tools. Here, we introduce spatially-resolved laser-activated cell sorting (SLACS) technology coupled to next generation sequencing and mass spectrometry that analyzes genetic molecules from regions of interest within spatial context. Specifically, we demonstrate application of SLACS in various cancers such as breast cancer, glioblastoma, glioma, meningioma, multiple myeloma, and leukemia. Examples of discovering cancer biomarker and their mechanism of action within spatial context are also provided. Specifically, we describe Select-seq which isolates the regions of interest as small as single cells from the immunofluorescence stained tissue and obtains the full-length transcriptome data. We demonstrated Select-seq on tumor tissue section from triple negative breast cancer patient who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Select-seq produced full-length spatial transcriptome data, with which we analyzed the transcriptomic and epitranscriptomic features including alternative splicing variant, complementarity-determining region analysis of B cells, and even adenosine-to-inosine base editing. We were also able to analyze the immune- and stem-cell-like microniches, in which the complex mechanisms behind ferroptosis inhibition might suggest therapeutic options for the TNBC patients. Bridging spatial technologies to omics technologies, the discovery of specific markers within spatial context will provide insights into the next generation diagnostics and cancer therapeutics such as cancer vaccines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Gene expression analysis,Stem cells,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Amos  C.

Additional atypical lesions of the FT known as p53 signature lesions and serous tubal intraepithelial lesions (STIL) have been proposed as early precursors in the carcinogenic sequence based on morphology, histochemical and genetic studies. Little however is known about the molecular events that drive FT epithelial cells to transform into HGSC.Methods: To elucidate the molecular changes that underlie the progression from p53 signature to STIL to STIC, we performed spatial transcriptomics on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections using the Nanostring GeoMx Whole Transcriptome Atlas panel (18,000 protein-encoding gene panel). Our study cohort consisted of 16 representative cases (3 p53 signature cases, 3 STIL cases, 3 STIC lesions, and 7 STIC cases with matched HGSC).Results: We characterized gene expression to a depth of over 9400 genes in these rare precursor cell populations. Our analysis demonstrated that by gene expression profiles, p53 signatures and STIL lesions bear close resemblance to normal FT secretory cells compared to FT ciliated cells or even STIC and invasive HGSC. We identify for the first time, several pathways altered in expression between normal fallopian tube epithelium and early p53 signature lesions including those related to signaling pathways (Trop-2), Wnt pathway (LGR5), identifying new pathways observed in the progression from normal FT cells to precursor intraepithelial lesion. Our data show that STIC lesions bear significant similarities to invasive HGSC by gene expression, especially compared to the earlier precursor lesions (p53 signature and STIL). We observed several alterations in cell-adhesion(EGR1) and signaling pathways, transcription factors (Trop-2) and metabolism that mark the transition from STIC to HGSC, representing possible mechanisms by which these intraepithelial lesions transform into disseminated invasive disease. Conclusion: Our data profile HGSC precursor lesions in high-depth with characterization of over 9400 genes providing new insight into the molecular alterations that characterize these intraepithelial lesions. Our future direction is to pair transcriptomics data with our established spatial proteomics platform (Deep Visual Proteomics) to measure matched spatial protein expression in our cohort.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-08 Spatial proteomics and transcriptomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE),Gene expression,RNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Rahul Krishnan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lisa Schweizer<sup>2<\/sup>, Agnes Bilecz<sup>1<\/sup>, Aasa Shimizu<sup>1<\/sup>, Rachelle Mendoza<sup>3<\/sup>, Diane Yamada<sup>1<\/sup>, Ricardo Lastra<sup>3<\/sup>, Matthias Mann<sup>2<\/sup>, Ernst Lengyel<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Gynecologic Oncology, Obstetrics & Gynecology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL,<sup>2<\/sup>Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Munich, Germany,<sup>3<\/sup>Pathology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5c4c7076-4a31-4634-a249-f8591a2988ae","ControlNumber":"961","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.
