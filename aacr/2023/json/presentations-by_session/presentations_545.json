The etiology is believed to be largely cell-intrinsic in non-hormonal cancers, attributed to such genomic alterations as focal amplification of non-coding regions, aberrant activation of transcription factors, and non-coding mutations creating de novo transcription factor binding sites. Here, using freshly resected primary CRC tumors and patient-matched adjacent normal colon epithelia, we find divergent epigenetic landscapes between primary CRC tumors and CRC cell lines. We identify a unique super-enhancer signature largely absent in cell culture. Intriguingly, this phenomenon extends to highly recurrent aberrant super-enhancers gained in CRC over patient-matched normal epithelium suggesting novel insight into the etiology of enhancer reprogramming in CRC and its downstream relevance to tumor biology. We find one such super-enhancer activated in epithelial cancer cells due to surrounding inflammation in the tumor microenvironment. CRISPR-dcas9-KRAB interference of this super-enhancer identifies <i>PDZK1IP1 <\/i>as its target gene. <i>PDZK1IP1 <\/i>is previously observed to be highly up-regulated in CRC. However, the mechanism behind its transcriptional activation is not fully understood. We restore both the super-enhancer and <i>PDZK1IP1 <\/i>levels following treatment with cytokines or xenotransplantation into nude mice, thus demonstrating its etiology via local tumor microenvironment acquisition. Deletion of inflammatory transcription factors RELA and STAT3 in human CRC cells inhibits PDZK1IP1 induction in xenografts. <i>PDZK1IP1 <\/i>appears to be critical for CRC growth in the setting of its super-enhancer induction as xenografts, but not in cell culture where the super-enhancer is absent and expression is largely silent. Building on its known role in glucose uptake via SGLT receptors, we demonstrate mechanistically that <i>PDZK1IP1 <\/i>enhances the reductive capacity CRC cancer cells via the pentose phosphate pathway using polar metabolomic profiling. We show this activation enables efficient growth under oxidative conditions both <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo, <\/i>challenging the previous notion that <i>PDZK1IP1 <\/i>acts as a tumor suppressor in CRC. Collectively, these observations highlight the biologic significance of epigenomic profiling on patient-matched primary specimens and identify this microenvironment-acquired super-enhancer as an oncogenic driver in the setting of the inflamed tumor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-04 Epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenomics,Cancer metabolism,Colorectal adenocarcinoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Royce Zhou<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jia Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Tiphaine Martin<sup>1<\/sup>, Alexis Zachem<sup>1<\/sup>, John He<sup>1<\/sup>, Sait Ozturk<sup>1<\/sup>, Deniz Demircioglu<sup>1<\/sup>, Ankita Bansal<sup>1<\/sup>, Andrew Trotta<sup>1<\/sup>, Bruno Giotti<sup>1<\/sup>, Berkley Gryder<sup>2<\/sup>, Yao Shen<sup>1<\/sup>, Saul Carcamo<sup>1<\/sup>, Xuewei Wu<sup>1<\/sup>, Kaitlyn Bosch<sup>1<\/sup>, Benjamin Hopkins<sup>1<\/sup>, Alexander Tsankov<sup>1<\/sup>, Randolph Steinhagen<sup>1<\/sup>, Drew Jones<sup>3<\/sup>, John Asara<sup>4<\/sup>, Jerry Chipuk<sup>1<\/sup>, Rachel Brody<sup>1<\/sup>, Steven Itzkowitz<sup>1<\/sup>, Iok In Christine Chio<sup>5<\/sup>, Dan Hasson<sup>1<\/sup>, Emily Bernstein<sup>1<\/sup>, Ramon Parsons<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY,<sup>2<\/sup>Case Western School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH,<sup>3<\/sup>NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY,<sup>4<\/sup>Beth Isreal Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA,<sup>5<\/sup>Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bc6caeff-7c1a-4171-9ea6-40097bbfae48","ControlNumber":"1582","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.

However, we currently lack the <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo <\/i>models required to functionally validate such lesions and their tumorigenic impact. Here we model aberrations that arise in Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant lower-grade gliomas, which exhibit profound DNA hypermethylation as a direct consequence of mutant IDH. DNA hypermethylation may promote gliomagenesis by silencing tumor suppressor genes or, alternatively, by activating proto-oncogenes through disruption of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) insulators. CTCF insulator sites define the three-dimensional shape of the genome by dictating the boundaries of topologically associated domains (TADs). Enhancers and promoters can interact when located in the same TAD but are restricted from interacting across different TADs. In IDH mutant gliomas, CpG sites around CTCF binding sites are frequently methylated, effectively compromising CTCF binding and thus TAD organization, allowing for cross-TAD interactions and aberrant activation of genes. We discovered a CTCF insulator downstream of the <i>PDGFRA<\/i> proto-oncogene that is recurrently disrupted in IDH mutant gliomas. We demonstrate that disruption of the syntenic insulator in mouse oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) allows an OPC-specific enhancer to contact and induce <i>Pdgfra<\/i>, thereby increasing proliferation. In contrast, insulator disruption did not affect <i>Pdgfra<\/i> expression in neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which lack the enhancer. We also model a second recurrent epigenetic lesion in IDH<sup> <\/sup>mutant gliomas, the methylation-dependent silencing of the <i>CDKN2A<\/i> tumor suppressor. We show that inactivation of <i>Cdkn2a<\/i>\/p19ARF by <i>de novo<\/i> promoter methylation or mutation drives OPC proliferation and cooperates with <i>Pdgfra<\/i> insulator loss. Finally, we use lentiviruses to coordinately inactivate the <i>Pdgfra<\/i> insulator and <i>Cdkn2a<\/i> in mouse corpus callosum, resulting in low-grade gliomagenesis <i>in vivo<\/i> with histological features reminiscent of human IDH mutant gliomas. Our study recapitulates recurrent epigenetic lesions in mouse models and demonstrates that the combination of <i>Pdgfra<\/i> activation and <i>Cdkn2a<\/i> silencing can transform OPCs <i>in vitro<\/i> and drive gliomagenesis <i>in vivo<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-01 Chromatin structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromatin remodeling,Epigenetics,Glioma,IDH1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Gilbert J.

Surgical resection remains the best treatment for NSCLC, but late diagnosis with associated metastasis precludes this as a viable modality for most patients. Furthermore, other treatments such as targeted therapies, cytotoxics, and immunotherapy only benefit a minority of patients. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed to benefit more patients presenting with this devastating disease. Recent studies reveal that DNMT inhibitor (DNMTi) promotes tumor-infiltrative cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, shifts myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to anti-tumor macrophage-like phenotype, and enhances immunotherapy efficacy. However, some immune-regulatory genes are silenced by H3K27me3, which is facilitated by the transcriptional repressor EZH2. Additionally, conditional ablation of Ezh2 in T cells boosts effector functions of CD8+ T cells and prevents the development of regulatory T cells. Given the above, the application of combining DNMTi and EZH2i might be a viable path to facilitate tumor immune microenvironment remodeling.<br \/>In this study, we aimed to define the therapeutic potential of combining DNMT and EZH2 inhibition to facilitate an anti-tumor immune response. First, we explored the potential of combined DNMTi and EZH2i in a clinically relevant murine model of NSCLC, Lewis Lung Carcinoma 1 (LLC1). Therapeutic application in this model led to a significant reduction in tumor volume. Our transcriptomic data revealed DNMTi facilitated transcriptional perturbation of both coding and transposable element-related genes, which is driven further by EZH2i combination. Immune deconvolution analysis uncovers combination therapy-induced shifts in tumor immune-cellularity, which is most profound for myeloid-associated populations. Orthogonal validation by flow cytometry defines significant reductions of MDSCs and regulatory T cells occurring within the tumor and associated microenvironment.<br \/>Given the perturbations of T and myeloid cells observed in-vivo, we sought to define the drug effects on critical cell populations contained in these lineages. These data revealed that combining DNMTi and EZH2i promotes effector CD8+ T cells with more IFN-g secretion upon activation but halts the cells from exhaustion after chronic stimulation. Moreover, co-treatment promoted maturation, cross-presentation, and antigen-specific CD8+ T cell priming in dendritic cells (DCs). These data indicate that CD8+ T cells and DCs subjected to co-treatment might facilitate more robust tumor immune responses in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In summary, our data define an effective therapeutic paradigm for the treatment of NSCLC, which potentiates significant shifts in TME resident immune populations and dendritic cell phenotypes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-02 DNA methylation,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Histone methylation,DNA methylation,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ying-Yu Chen<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"eb903e3a-c64c-48de-a104-2e797e38fd75","ControlNumber":"392","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is one of the most common adult leukemia in western countries. Spliceosome mutations occur in ~20% of patients. However, the mechanism for splicing defects in spliceosome unmutated CLL cases remains elusive. Through an integrative transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of primary CLL samples, we discovered proteins involved in RNA splicing are post-transcriptionally upregulated. Coupled with clinical annotation, we found spliceosome protein abundance is an independent risk factor and associated with poor prognosis. Splice variants found in CLL are highly overlapped with those driven by high spliceosome abundance but not splicing factor mutations, indicating high spliceosome abundance contributes to genetic lesion-independent splicing defects. To identify potential regulators for spliceosome, we proteome-widely analyzed the proteins that highly correlated with splicing factors expression. Analysis of 113 CLL samples has consistently identified METTL3 upregulation with positive correlation with 77.6% of detected splicing factors. METTL3 is an RNA methyltransferase that modifies N<sup>6<\/sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6<\/sup>A) on mRNA and regulates the translation of m<sup>6<\/sup>A-installed transcripts. m<sup>6<\/sup>A level on mRNA is increased in CLL cells with differential m<sup>6<\/sup>A highly enriched on splicing related transcripts. Moreover, high METTL3 expression in CLL is also associated with poor clinical outcomes. These results suggested that <i>METTL3<\/i> translationally controls splicing factors through m<sup>6<\/sup>A and plays a role in CLL progression. Toward this end, we demonstrated that <i>METTL3<\/i> is essential for CLL growth in both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo <\/i>studies. Knock out (KO) and pharmaceutical inhibition of <i>METTL3<\/i><i> <\/i>decreased cell growth and splicing factor expression. Overexpression of wildtype<i> <\/i>but not catalytic mutant <i>METTL3 <\/i>restored both defects in <i>METTL3<\/i> KO cells, indicating that the regulation of splicing factor is m<sup>6<\/sup>A-dependent. To dissect the underlying mechanism, we performed an integrated Ribo-seq, RNA-seq, and MeRIP-seq on CLL cells with or without <i>METTL3<\/i><i>.<\/i> KO of <i>METTL3<\/i> decreased overall translation efficiency (TE) with RNA splicing as the most significantly affected pathway. Splicing factors with reduced TE displayed either hypo-m<sup>6<\/sup>A at stop codon region or hyper-m<sup>6<\/sup>A at CDS regions upon <i>METTL3<\/i> KO, as direct or indirect targets of <i>METTL3<\/i>. Moreover, we found that m<sup>6<\/sup>A at stop codon and CDS regions regulates splicing factor translation via ribosome recycling and ribosome pausing, respectively. Taken together, our results uncovered a novel regulatory axis for <i>METTL3<\/i> that controls splicing factor translation and contributes to CLL progression. Our study highlights a post-transcriptional layer of m<sup>6<\/sup>A modification as a major contributor to genetic lesion-independent splicing defects in CLL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,Spliceosome,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yiming Wu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Meiling Jin<sup>1<\/sup>, Mike Fernandez<sup>1<\/sup>, Kevyn Hart<sup>1<\/sup>, Aijun Liao<sup>1<\/sup>, Stacey M.

Compact chromatin acts as a barrier to gene expression and is a key property governing DNA replication and gene expression. Analyzing over 46,000 in cancer patient samples in cBioPortal, we characterized mutations located in canonical histone genes and found several recurrent missense mutations. Foremost among the identified mutations was a glutamate to lysine missense mutation at amino acid 76 of histone H2B (H2B-E76K) that disrupts histone H2B-H4 interaction. Previously, we demonstrated that exogenous expression of H2B-E76K disrupted nucleosome stability, altered chromatin accessibility, and gene expression. We developed a new model utilizing CRISPR &#8220;knock-in&#8221; technology to integrate the E76K mutation into the endogenous H2BC4 gene of the lung epithelial cell line BEAS-2B to create a homozygous and heterozygous H2B-E76K cell line. Although the mutant histone only accounts for about 2-5% of total histone H2B, expression of H2B-E76K catalyzed distinct changes in cell migration, proliferation, colony formation and gene expression. CUT&#38;RUN technology revealed mutant histones broadly incorporate throughout the genome. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that H2B-E76K homozygous cells displayed expression changes similar to polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) disruption or oncogenic KRAS expression. Using available datasets, we discovered that expression of H2B-E76K caused increased expression of PTN, PKIB, and CDH2, genes important in migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and adhesion pathways. Furthermore, analysis of chromatin accessibility changes indicated that increased accessibility was significant in and around genes governing cell migration. Notably, H2B-E76K significantly increased heterogeneity of gene expression as measured using scRNA-seq. Together these results indicate that mutations disrupting histone structure may create millions of dysfunctional nucleosomes and new sites of &#8220;open&#8221; chromatin, resulting in loss of nucleosome-mediated gene repression and\/or altered interactions with regulators of chromatin, fundamentally changing cell growth and migration properties to favor tumorigenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Epigenetics,Cancer progression,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kimberly Espinoza Pereira<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Richard L.

However, the functional contributions of these subunits, particularly their commonly mutated N-terminal intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and a highly conserved ARID DNA-binding domain, to BAF function remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the IDRs of ARID1A\/B, coupled with the ARID domain, drive biomolecular condensate formation and BAF chromatin localization in cells. We define ARID1A\/B IDRs as two-part systems, facilitating homotypic BAF complex interactions (i.e., valence generated by localized condensation) and heterotypic complex interactions, that together establish a highly specific, sequence-encoded protein interaction network within condensates. Both types of interactions are required for appropriate genome-wide targeting of BAF complexes, DNA accessibility generation, and appropriate gene expression. Replacement of the ARID1A N-terminal IDR with IDRs derived from two unrelated proteins FUS and DDX4, rescues generic condensation of BAF but not chromatin occupancy, DNA accessibility, and heterotypic interactions, highlighting the sequence-specificity embedded in the IDR of ARID1A. Taken together, these data establish a role for the largest and most frequently perturbed IDRs within a major chromatin remodeler and explain how biomolecular condensate formation enables both genomic localization and functional partner recruitment. Furthermore, these findings lay the groundwork for mapping IDR sequence specificity or &#8220;grammar&#8221;, that dictates the co-condensation network formation, and suggests that targeted disruption of these mechanisms may represent new targeted therapeutic opportunities across multiple cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-04 Epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ajinkya Patil<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Amy  R.
