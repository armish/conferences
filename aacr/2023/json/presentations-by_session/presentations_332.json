[{"Abstract":"Introduction: Precision medicine is becoming increasingly important in cancer treatment, and liquid biopsy (LB) is a core technique. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is the main target for LB; however, in some patients, its sensitivity is inadequate. Detection of post-operative ctDNA, called Minimal Residual Disease (MRD), indicates cancer recurrence; however, some patients experience recurrent disease without being MRD-positive. To improve sensitivity of ctDNA detection, we focused on exosomes, small vesicles of endosomal origin that contain DNA (exoDNA) derived from cells, including cancer cells. In this study, we assayed <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations in patients with colorectal cancer using exoDNA, and analyzed the utility of biomarkers in prognosis, using a machine learning algorithm.<br \/>Materials and Methods: Patients who underwent curative surgery for colorectal cancer from November 2018 to December 2020 were recruited prospectively. Blood samples were obtained before surgery, and ctDNA was extracted from 1 mL of plasma. Exosomes were isolated from this plasma, followed by exoDNA extraction. <i>KRAS <\/i>mutations in ctDNA and exoDNA were analyzed using droplet digital PCR. The Random Survival Forest (RSF) algorithm was used for variable importance analysis.<br \/>Results: 300 patients (123 with <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation and 177 without) were included. The median patient age was 71 years (range: 35 - 91). Concentrations of exoDNA were significantly higher in Stage IV patients compared to patients at other stages (p &#60; 0.01). Numbers of exosomes did not differ by stage. <i>KRAS <\/i>mutations were detected in exoDNA of 56 patients (45.5%) and in ctDNA of 28 patients with <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation in their tumors (22.7%, p&#60;0.001). Sensitivity of exoDNA was higher than that of ctDNA in Stage II\/III patients with <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations (Stage II; 33.3% vs 14.2%, p=0.02, Stage III 46.7% vs 13.3%, p=0.001). However, sensitivity of cfDNA was almost equal to that of exoDNA in stage IV patients (53.8% vs 50.0%, p = 0.78). Surprisingly, in patients without <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations in their tumors, <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations were detected in exoDNA of 24 patients (13.5%) and in ctDNA of one patient (0.5%). Of 103 stage III patients, 31 (30.1%) experienced recurrence. The RSF algorithm showed that the exoDNA concentration is the most important risk factor for recurrence, followed by a lack of adjuvant chemotherapy.<br \/>Conclusion: Sensitivity of <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation detection using exoDNA is excellent. Additionally, the concentration of exoDNA appears to be a superior predictor for recurrence of Stage II\/III colorectal cancer after curative surgery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Exosomes,Circulating tumor DNA,Colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sho Kuriyama<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Takeshi Yamada<sup><\/sup>, Hiromichi Sonoda<sup><\/sup>, Seiichi Shinji<sup><\/sup>, Akihisa Matsuda<sup><\/sup>, Kazuhide Yonaga<sup><\/sup>, Takuma Iwai<sup><\/sup>, Kohki Takeda<sup><\/sup>, Koji Ueda<sup><\/sup>, Toshimitsu Miyasaka<sup><\/sup>, Shintaro Kanaka<sup><\/sup>, Hiroshi Yoshida<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"addfa89b-646d-4470-b86c-14d42600c098","ControlNumber":"3340","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

We developed a custom-built, tumor-informed MRD detection method named OncoWES-MRD. Somatic variants were identified and prioritized by whole-exome sequencing (WES) of tumor tissues and matched peripheral blood samples. Patient-specific panel targeting up to 50 top-ranked single-nucleotide and Indel variants was designed to analyze plasma for assessing the presence of ctDNA. The ctDNA level was also quantified by in-house software. Here, we report the analytical validation results of this assay.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>The analytical validation was performed on a colorectal cancer cell line SW480. The sheared SW480 DNA was titrated to normal DNA from NA12878 cell line to produce samples with a variant allele frequency (VAF) of 0.1%. The dilution accuracy was confirmed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Then the 0.1% samples were serially diluted to VAF of 0.05%, 0.02%, 0.01%, 0.005%, 0.003%, and 0.001%. As for these dilution gradients below the detection limit blank of the ddPCR assay (0.1%), the changes of exogenously introduced viral DNA copies were used as indicators of the dilution ratio. To explore the relations between the number of variants and the limit of detection (LoD), a customized capture panel covering 200 prioritized variants for SW480 was designed. Each gradient was tested 42 times with an average sequencing depth above 100,000X. The analytical specificity assessment was conducted on 20 NA12878 wild-type samples and 44 blood samples from 22 healthy donors. The library prep starting DNA input was 60 ng for each reaction. ctDNA fraction was evaluated using the maximum likelihood method, and also taking allelic copy number and cancer cell fraction into consideration.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The WES-MRD assay by monitoring 50 variants demonstrated a sample-level sensitivity of 97.6% at VAF of 0.003%, and 76.2% sensitivity at VAF of 0.001%, along with a specificity of 98.4%. The LOD of 0.1% VAF was achieved at the single variant level. The assay performed 95.2% analytical sensitivity at 0.02% VAF, even with 6 somatic mutations, therefore defining the minimal monitoring number. Based on WES sequencing data of 514 solid tumors, 96.1% of samples met the assay requirement of variant numbers. The upper limit monitoring variants number was set to 50, as keep increasing the monitoring variants showed limited sensitivity improvement while specificity was impaired.

Recently, B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) has emerged as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for MM due to its selective high expression on malignant PCs, improving the treatment landscape. However, the current diagnostic workup relies on bone marrow aspirates (BMA) which are highly invasive and do not allow for the detection of BCMA levels on circulating PCs, severely limiting the options for repeatable assessments and treatment-monitoring. In our study, we report the utility of a blood-based liquid biopsy, using enrichment-free high definition single cell assay (HDSCA) for the detection, quantification, and morphological characterization of circulating PCs and other BCMA+ cells. We applied a previously validated 4-color immunofluorescence assay using DAPI, CD138, BCMA, and CD45 to examine matched peripheral blood and BMAs from 68 patients across the MM disease spectrum (11 monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [MGUS], 21 smoldering MM [SMM], 18 newly diagnosed MM, and 18 relapsed refractory MM [RRMM]) and peripheral blood from 23 normal donors as controls. Our analysis revealed diverse subtypes of circulating CD138(+\/-), BCMA(+\/-), and CD45(+\/-) cells across the patients, representing both normal and abnormal PCs. We detected significantly higher circulating CD138+ BCMA(+\/-) cells in MM precursor conditions (MGUS, SMM), compared to the normal donors. Additionally, we were able to detect BCMA+ oncosomes (identified by the lack of a nuclear structure) in the circulation of patients from both precursor and overt disease conditions. Our findings establish the utility of HDSCA blood-based liquid biopsy for early disease detection and anti-BCMA therapy response monitoring in MM and other B-cell malignancies expressing BCMA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,BCMA,Multiple myeloma,Early detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sonia Maryam Setayesh<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Stephanie Shishido<sup>1<\/sup>, Libere Ndacayisaba<sup>1<\/sup>, Amin Naghdloo<sup>1<\/sup>, Jeremy Mason<sup>1<\/sup>, Dean Tessone<sup>1<\/sup>, Carli Kaleta<sup>1<\/sup>, Robert Z.

While patients with localized disease show marginally better survival rates, 52% of pancreatic cancers are not diagnosed until metastases have already developed. There is therefore a critically unmet need in the early diagnoses of pancreatic cancer patients.<b><\/b> Liquid biopsies have emerged as a promising tool for cancer diagnosis through the analysis of various blood-based biomarkers. Among these, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) stand out as a promising target of interest. Over the past decade, CTCs have been identified as a precursor to metastasis. CTCs have also been shown to harbor mutations matching those of the primary tumor, making them a potential surrogate for biopsied tissue. However, CTCs are an extremely heterogenous population of cells, making bulk analysis challenging. In this study, we demonstrate a workflow for the isolation and genomic characterization of single CTCs from pancreatic cancer patients. CTCs are first enriched using a size-based microfluidic system, the Labyrinth, developed in the Nagrath lab. Single CTCs are subsequently isolated using the DEPArray Nxt system, followed by whole genome amplification (WGA) and low-pass sequencing. The pipeline was optimized using three commercially available pancreatic cancer cells lines (Panc-1, Capan-2, and BxPC-3) and two pancreatic cancer CTC cell lines previously developed in-house (CTC-CL-1 and CTC-CL-2). Finally, the workflow was validated using a blood sample from a stage IV pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patient. Following WGA, the average nucleic material concentration of the cell lines was 26.24 &#177; 16.28 ng\/&#956;L and 14.43 ng\/&#956;L for cells isolated from the patient sample. The average fragment size was 746 &#177; 232.79 bp for cell line cells and 507 bp for patient sample cells. This was within the expected range of 100-2000 bp. Both CTC cell lines show gains on parts of chromosome 8q (Myc), 10q (FGFR2) and 17q. Myc is a known oncogene and FGFR2 has been associated with cell growth, migration, and invasion. There are also noticeable differences between the two CTC-CL-1 cells, with one cell showing a 3p12.3-3p26.3 gain (CTNNB1), and the other showing a loss of 6q12-6q15 and gain of 6q16.1-6q27 (Myb, ESR1). A patient sample CTC and patient-matched WBC were isolated and sequenced. The CTC has a noticeable gain of chromosome 1q and loss of chromosome 5q. A gain in chromosome 1q has been seen previously in pancreatic cancer and chromosome 5q is the location of multiple oncogenes including APC, CSF1R and FGFR4. The loss of APC is known to affect Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling, causing an increase in CD34 expression which is linked to increase in cell invasion and migration. These results demonstrate an efficient workflow for the single cell genomic analysis of pancreatic CTCs. Further studies can be conducted to characterize the heterogenous landscape of CTCs in pancreatic cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Liquid biopsies,Copy number variation,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Harrison Ball<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Brittany Rupp<sup>1<\/sup>, Sarah Owen<sup>1<\/sup>, Kaylee Smith<sup>1<\/sup>, Valerie Gunchick<sup>2<\/sup>, Evan  T.

Widespread metastatic disease is incurable, yet some patients with oligometastatic disease experience prolonged progression-free survival when treated with aggressive local stereotactic body radiotherapy (RT). Distinguishing patients who would benefit from aggressive RT from those who would benefit from systemic therapies remains a challenge. We hypothesized that pre-RT ctDNA can be used to risk-stratify those with oligometastatic NSCLC and enable earlier personalized approaches when considering systemic therapy versus aggressive local RT.<br \/>Methods: A retrospective multi-institutional cohort of 1,487 patients (median age: 65 years, 53% female [n=784], 47% male [n=703]) who were diagnosed with oligometastatic NSCLC was selected. Each patient underwent liquid biopsy ctDNA analysis using the Tempus xF assay (v2) at least once, with a subset of patients undergoing serial sampling at 2-8 timepoints for a total of 1,880 ctDNA assays. 309 of the patients (20%) underwent RT after liquid biopsy was obtained and oligometastatic NSCLC was diagnosed. Outcomes for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were defined with respect to the initiation time of RT (i.e., time from RT to death, time from RT to progressive disease).<br \/>Results: Across all ctDNA assays, 3,520 pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P\/LP) variants were identified (1.8 variants\/sample, mean). Among patients with a liquid biopsy obtained prior to RT, 48% (n=151) experienced progressive disease and 11% (n=34) died during the study period. Focusing on patients with ctDNA obtained pre-RT, P\/LP variants were detected in 74% (n=230) while 26% (n=79) had zero variants detected. Of those with detectable variants, 76% (n=175) had 1-3 variants, while 24% (n=55) had &#8805;4 P\/LP variants detected in ctDNA. Both overall survival and progression-free survival were significantly worse in patients with detectable ctDNA from pre-RT liquid biopsy compared to those without (median OS 16.8 months vs. 25 months; p=0.027, HR=1.65; median PFS 5.4 months vs. 8.8 months; p=0.021, HR=1.57). Remarkably, survival correlated inversely with the number of detected variants from pre-RT liquid biopsies; when patients were stratified by variant quantity, both OS and PFS were significant (OS p=0.045, PFS p=0.003; stratified by 0, 1-3, and &#8805;4 variants). This finding was also significant in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis (OS HR=1.15, CI 1.04-1.24; PFS HR=1.16, CI 1.06-1.25), but was not significant for parameters such as age at diagnosis or squamous histology.<br \/>Conclusions: These data suggest that a ctDNA-informed approach may be a powerful pre-RT biomarker to help risk-stratify oligometastatic NSCLC patients and potentially enable personalized decision-making for RT versus systemic therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,ctDNA,Liquid biopsies,Radiation therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nicholas  P.

We employed cfDNA to determine chromosomal instability (CIN), nucleosome footprints (NF) and methylation profiles in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients and to predict outcome to bevacizumab (BVZ) combination therapy.<br \/>Experimental Design: Low coverage whole-genome sequencing (LC-WGS) was performed on matched tumor and plasma samples from 74 mCRC patients participating in the CTRIAL-IE 12-16 AC-ANGIOPREDICT Phase II clinical trial (NCT01822444), prior to receiving BVZ, and analyzed for CIN (3 subclusters with low, intermediate and high CIN, respectively) and nucleosomes. For 61\/74 mCRC patients, plasma samples before and after BVZ treatment were available and used for targeted methylation sequencing. A validation cohort of mCRC plasma samples (n= 24) from the University Medical Center Mannheim (UMM) was similarly profiled.<br \/>Results: Based on cfDNA CIN profiles, we subtyped mCRC patients with 92.3% accuracy of sample distinction into low and high CIN clusters (cluster 1 against cluster 2 and 3), demonstrating concordance between matched plasma and tumor samples. Improved survival outcome was observed in CIN high patients. Plasma-based CIN clustering and improved survival for CIN high patients was also confirmed in the UMM cohort. NF and methylation profiles differed between CIN clusters and healthy individuals, and could reliably separate cluster 1 from cluster 2 and 3 samples (AUC=0.72 and 0.85 respectively). A large methylation score decrease after BVZ treatment was associated with improved overall survival (p = 0.013).<br \/>Conclusions: cfDNA can be analyzed to predict outcome to BVZ in mCRC patients. Detection of CNAs, NFs and methylation profiles facilitated stratification of samples into CIN clusters and informed patient response to treatment. <b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Chromosomal instability,Liquid biopsies,Cell-free DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ian S.

In a prior report by Zhang et al (Nat Commun 2021), certain actionable mutations were more prevalent in ctDNA than tissue-based databases (e.g., <i>EGFR<\/i> 48% versus 25.2%). Our group investigated if discrepancies in patterns of pathogenic variants between liquid biopsy and tissue specimens in a subtype of metastatic urothelial carcinoma (<i>MTAP<\/i> deleted) can inform the best approach of utilizing tissue or blood. MTAP (methyl-adenosine phosphorylase) is an enzyme involved in salvage purine biosynthesis and its deletion confers sensitivity to pemetrexed and taxanes, but resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors. The <i>MTAP<\/i> gene is deleted in 25% of urothelial carcinomas. We report herein the pattern of pathogenic variants from ctDNA in 17 patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma, 10 with <i>MTAP<\/i>-deletion and 17 with <i>MTAP<\/i> wild-type. Among 10 patients with <i>MTAP<\/i>-deleted urothelial carcinoma with collected ctDNA, 3 had no detected pathogenic variant. The most common pathogenic variants in 7 patients were <i>TP53<\/i> (4\/7, 57%), <i>TERT<\/i> (4\/7, 57%), <i>ERBB2<\/i> (2\/7, 28%); <i>PIK3CA<\/i> (2\/7, 28%), and <i>NFE2L2<\/i> (2\/7, 28%). The mutations found in paired ctDNA and tissue based NGS were <i>TP53<\/i> in 26.6 % (4\/15), <i>TERT<\/i> in 21.0 % (4\/19), <i>ERBB2<\/i> in 66.6 % (2\/3), <i>PIK3CA<\/i> in 50 % (2\/4), and <i>NFE2L2<\/i> in 100% (1\/1) of patients. Three of the 10 patients with collected ctDNA had <i>ELF3 <\/i>frameshift loss-of- function alterations on tissue not found on ctDNA. Among 54 patients with <i>MTAP<\/i> wild-type urothelial carcinoma, 26 had collected ctDNA. Among these 26 patients, 9 had no detected pathogenic variants. Among the 17 patients with pathogenic variants, the most common mutations were <i>TP53<\/i> (76%, 13\/17), <i>TERT<\/i> (47%, 8\/17), <i>ERBB2<\/i> (24%, 4\/17), <i>RB1 <\/i>(24%, 4\/17), and <i>BRCA1<\/i> or <i>BRCA2<\/i> (24%, 4\/17). Three of these 17 patients had no or insufficient tissue for NGS. The mutations found in paired ctDNA and tissue based NGS were <i>TP53<\/i> in 100% (14\/14), <i>TERT<\/i> in 64% (9\/14), <i>ERBB2<\/i> in 43% (6\/14), <i>RB1<\/i> in 29% (5\/14), and <i>BRCA1<\/i> or <i>BRCA2<\/i> in 36% (5\/14) of patients. <i>MTAP<\/i> wild-type patients had a higher frequency of <i>TERT<\/i> alterations (p=0.012), but not <i>ERBB2<\/i>, (p=0.453) than patients with <i>MTAP<\/i>-deleted type tumors.

While imaging remains the gold standard for monitoring the efficacy of cancer treatment, the use of more sensitive tools, such as liquid biopsy, could be beneficial for the patient&#8217;s ultimate treatment outcome. Several liquid biopsy-based assays that measure circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) have been developed to meet this need. However, approaches that rely on quantifying the variant allele fraction (VAF) of somatic variants may be inaccurate or inconsistent due to a scarcity of detected somatic variants in the ctDNA or may be logistically infeasible if they require a tumor biopsy <i>a priori<\/i>. Methylated ctDNA has shown promise as a biomarker for treatment monitoring without requiring a tumor biopsy, but current efforts are limited in their ability to precisely quantify the amount of methylation present in the ctDNA. We hypothesize that more precise quantification of methylated ctDNA could enable more accurate correspondence with clinical tumor load and cancer treatment outcomes.<br \/>Here, we present a retrospective study characterizing how amounts of methylated ctDNA dynamically change through cancer therapy. We tested 75 patient-treatment events, with each event composed of patient samples from one pre-treatment and two post-treatment time points, all from patients with Stage III-IV metastatic lung cancer receiving targeted therapies or immunotherapy. We employed a novel methylation-based, tumor-naive liquid biopsy assay for treatment monitoring by counting the number of methylated molecules in cell-free DNA. We observed methylation amounts ranging from &#60;50 to &#62;50,000 total methylated tumor molecules per 1000 assayed genomic equivalents at individual time points, indicating that the assay can detect a broad range of tumor load in blood. In addition, we measured changes between time points as large as &#62;96% decrease and &#62;2800% increase in methylation. We found that methylation correlated with maximum variant allele fractions as measured by a treatment selection assay (r<sup>2<\/sup> = 0.74). Moreover, in this tumor-naive assay, we identified a median of 58 informative methylated loci, significantly more than a median of ~1-5 informative SNVs identified in VAF-based tumor-naive assays, and ~4-16 informative SNVs identified in VAF-based tumor-informed assays. This ~6-10x increase in the number of informative loci enables much more precise quantification and underlies the assay&#8217;s robustness and precision across patients, time points, and therapies. Finally, these changes in normalized total tumor molecules correlated with radiographic responses on imaging, duration of response, and time on therapy. Overall, our findings support the utility of methylated ctDNA as a biomarker for monitoring tumor load in cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell-free DNA,Methylation,Liquid biopsies,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Patrick Ye<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Brian Woodward<sup>2<\/sup>, Robb Viens<sup>1<\/sup>, Sydne Langpap<sup>1<\/sup>, Katherine Shelburne<sup>1<\/sup>, Wen Zhou<sup>1<\/sup>, Joyce Zhu<sup>1<\/sup>, Jan Wignall<sup>1<\/sup>, Gary Palmer<sup>1<\/sup>, David Tsao<sup>1<\/sup>, Oguzhan Atay<sup>1<\/sup>, Hatim Husain<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>BillionToOne Inc., Menlo Park, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f31ff079-265e-4c17-9a8d-2d7fa9d4f1ee","ControlNumber":"2317","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;P.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide and metastasis is the major cause of death. Previous studies showed poorer survival in CRC patients treated perioperatively with morphine in comparison to piritramide.<br \/>Patients and Methods: In total, 150 CRC stage I-III patients undergoing either radical or laparoscopic surgery were enrolled in this prospective multicentric randomized study (NCT03700411). Patients were randomized into three arms using different perioperative analgesia - morphine, piritramide, and epidural analgesia. Three peripheral blood samples were collected preoperatively, one day and one month after surgery respectively. To preserve the cellular content of specimens, Cell-Free DNA BCT<sup>&#174; <\/sup>(Streck, Inc.) blood collection tubes were used. The CTCs were identified using CytoTrack CT11<sup>TM<\/sup> (2\/C, Denmark), a semi-automated immunofluorescence microscopy detecting the pan-cytokeratin and EpCAM signals. The method recovery rate was analyzed using SW-480 cancer cell line by flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: The CTCs recovery rate of the method was 72% and the method was certified by ISO 15189. The analyses of CTC presence revealed the highest positivity rate in the samples collected from patients treated with morphine on the first day after surgery (51.4 %). Also, a significant increase in positivity (from 23.5 % for the perioperatively collected samples) compared to samples from patients treated with epidural analgesia (31.1 % to 33.3 %) and piritramide (44.2% to 41.0%) was observed. The CTC presence was lower in control samples collected after one month irrespective of the analgesia type. The highest positivity among the control samples was in those associated with morphine analgesia (32.1 % versus 25.7% for epidural and 25.0% for piritramide analgesia).<br \/>Conclusion: A significant increase in CTC levels was found in postoperative blood samples of CRC patients treated with morphine compared to piritramide and epidural analgesia.

Liquid biopsy assays using next generation sequencing technology provides a less invasive method for determining circulating tumour mutations (ctDNA) associated with targeted treatments or prognosis. As part of deploying technology to help cancer patients obtain molecular testing, a clinical program was initiated to offer liquid biopsy testing for Canadian patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer.<br \/>Methods: Blood was drawn in two 10 mL Streck<sup>TM<\/sup> DNA BCTs and sent to the CAP\/CLIA\/DAP accredited Imagia Canexia Health laboratory for testing using the clinically validated Follow It<sup>TM<\/sup> liquid biopsy assay. Plasma was isolated using a double spin protocol and plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) extracted using an optimized Promega Maxwell RSC method. Extracted cfDNA was amplified using the multiplex amplicon-based hotspot 30 or 38 gene panel and sequenced. An in-house developed bioinformatics pipeline and reporting platform were used to identify pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNVs), indels (insertions and deletions), and gene amplification. Included in the panel are genes associated with metastatic breast cancer: <i>AKT1, BRAF, ERBB2, ESR1, KRAS, PIK3CA, TP53.<\/i><br \/>Results: To identify biomarkers, 1214 metastatic or advanced breast cancer patient cfDNA samples were tested. There were 15 cases sent for repeat testing. We reported 48% of samples harboring pathogenic ctDNA mutations in <i>TP53<\/i> (22%), <i>PIK3CA<\/i> (19%), <i>ESR1<\/i> (18%), <i>AKT1<\/i> (2%), <i>ERBB2<\/i> (1.5%). Co-occurring variants were identified in samples with <i>ESR1<\/i>\/<i>PIK3CA<\/i> as well as <i>TP53<\/i>\/<i>PIK3CA<\/i> (both p-values &#60;0.001). Interestingly, 29% of samples with mutated <i>ESR1<\/i> harbored &#8805; 2 <i>ESR1<\/i> ctDNA mutations. In 56% of cases, previous molecular testing indicated the cancer subtype as hormone receptor (ER, PR) positive with\/without HER2 negative status. In this specific subgroup, 49% harbored ctDNA mutations with 63% of those being <i>PIK3CA<\/i> and\/or <i>ESR1 <\/i>mutations.<br \/>Conclusions: A population of Canadian women with metastatic breast cancer were tested using a liquid biopsy gene panel during the COVID-19 pandemic for identification of biomarkers for targeted therapeutic options. Over 50% of the samples were identified as hormone positive, with greater than 60% harboring <i>PIK3CA<\/i> and <i>ESR1<\/i> ctDNA mutations. Studies have shown that metastatic <i>PIK3CA<\/i> mutated ER-positive\/HER2-negative tumors are predictive to respond to alpelisib therapy and have FDA and Health Canada approval. Additionally, <i>ESR1<\/i> mutations are associated with acquired resistance to antiestrogen therapies, and interestingly we identified 29% of <i>ESR1<\/i> mutated samples with multiple mutations possibly indicating resistance subclones. In future studies, longitudinal monitoring for presence of multiple targetable and resistance mutations could be utilized to predict or improve clinical management.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Breast cancer,Circulating tumor DNA,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Benjamin  L.

Exome sequencing of pre-treatment biopsies was successful in 24\/26 patients (pts) (92.3%) who had received FLOT-A and had undergone surgery at the time of analysis. All pts had R0 resections. Tumor-informed ctDNA assays (Signatera<sup>TM<\/sup>) were designed for these 24 pts and 220 serial plasma samples were analyzed. Pathologic response was assessed using Mandard tumor regression grading (TRG1 complete, 2 excellent, 3 good, 4 poor and 5 no response). The median follow-up was 17.0m from surgery. Progression free survival (PFS) was calculated from surgery to radiological recurrence or death.<br \/>Results: ctDNA was detected in 23\/24 pts (95.8%) prior to treatment. PFS was significantly shorter for pts with a mean number of tumor DNA molecules per ml plasma in the middle &#38; highest tertile (p=0.049, HR=8.33, 95% CI: 1.01-1083, Firth Correction for Cox regression). 6 pts remained ctDNA-positive post neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). None of these pts had a TRG1\/2, 3 (50.0%) had TRG3 and 3 (50%) TRG4\/5 in the resection specimen. Of 18 ctDNA-negative pts 5 (27.8%) had TRG1\/2, 10 (55.6%) TRG3 and 3 (16.7%) TRG4\/5. Post-surgery and prior to adjuvant therapy, 6\/24 pts were ctDNA-positive. ctDNA positivity at this time point was associated with significantly shorter median PFS (12.9m) compared to ctDNA-negative status (PFS not reached, p&#60;0.0001, HR=27, 95%CI: 3.0-241). Nodal status and Mandard TRG are routinely used as clinical predictors. Only the former was significantly associated with poor median PFS (pN+: 13.5m, pN-: not reached, p=0.027, HR=11, 95%CI: 1.3-98). Of 6 pts who remained ctDNA positive post-operatively, none achieved ctDNA clearance despite adjuvant FLOT-A. The median lead-time from ctDNA positivity after surgery to recurrence was 11.4 months.<br \/>Conclusions: Post-NAC\/pre-surgical ctDNA positivity correlated with worse pathological response. Persistent ctDNA after NAC &#38; surgery was a stronger predictor of recurrence than nodal status or TRG in the resection specimen. Post-operative adjuvant therapy failed to clear ctDNA in any of the pts who were ctDNA positive after surgery, indicating that administering more of the same treatment is ineffective. This provides an opportunity to test new adjuvant therapies in pts who remain ctDNA positive after surgery. Whether post-operative therapy can be omitted in pts who are ctDNA negative after surgery should be assessed in future trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,Immunotherapy,Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Marco Gerlinger<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Anderley Gordon<sup>2<\/sup>, Louise  J.

Fusions involving anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are oncogenic drivers in ~ 7% of NSCLC. Previous studies have shown that drug resistance develops within ~2 years after ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeted therapy. Due to resistance mechanisms and the biological heterogeneity that evolves over the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC, it is important to monitor and study those dynamic changes through the clinical treatment course to understand cancer progression.<br \/>Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are rare cells, shed from cancer lesions into the bloodstream. They can be isolated from a patient's peripheral blood sample (~20ml) to enable study of tumor characteristics at multiple time points. They are promising biomarkers that not only offer phenotypic and genotypic information, but also present a potential to expand into patient derived ex vivo tumor models. In this study, we use a high throughput label-free microfluidic device, Labyrinth, developed in the Nagrath lab for cell size based CTC enrichment, followed by expansion of CTCs in organoid models, further molecular characterization, and growth in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b><br \/>Blood samples were collected from patients (n=22), three with known ALK status. CTC isolation was performed using Labyrinth at 2.0 mL\/min. A part of the isolated CTCs were immunofluorescently stained for pan cytokeratin (pan CK), CD45, DAPI, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), and vimentin markers for enumeration. Others were processed for expansion in ultralow attachment plates with three types of organoid culture media. The rest of the CTCs were used for molecular characterizations.<br \/>Growth curves were produced on expanded samples on Day 0, 7, 14, and 21 in different culture conditions. A live\/dead assay and in situ hybridization (FISH) were also performed. On Day 7, selected samples were injected into NSG&#8482; mice. Bulk RNA sequencing was conducted on the original tumor, Day 0 and 7 CTCs, and PDX samples.<br \/><b>Results<\/b><br \/>The median CTC concentration in this cohort (n=22) was 316.2 CTCs\/ ml of blood. Isolated CTCs from ALK+ NSCLC patients showed ALK fusions by FISH. We observed that the number of ALK CTCs was reduced over time consistent with decreased tumor size in CT scans. There were significant differences (p&#60;0.05) for vimentin positive CTCs compared to the other three types of CTCs, which indicated a higher prevalence of a mesenchymal state of NSCLC CTCs. One of the two samples successfully developed into PDX after two months. In summary, we demonstrated a successful workflow to enrich and expand CTCs from ALK+ NSCLC patients. The expanded CTCs can be further characterized and can generate tumors in PDX models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,ALK,NSCLC,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yuru Chen<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Shamileh Fouladdel<sup><\/sup>, Harrison Ball<sup><\/sup>, Xu Cheng<sup><\/sup>, Liwei Bao<sup><\/sup>, Habib Serhan<sup><\/sup>, Albert Liu<sup><\/sup>, Bryce Vandenburg<sup><\/sup>, Laura Goo<sup><\/sup>, Nathan Merrill<sup><\/sup>, Aaron Udager<sup><\/sup>, Angel Qin<sup><\/sup>, Sofia D.

Error correction with molecular barcodes and duplex DNA detection allowed calling of mutations &#8805;0.5% variant frequency (VF). This pilot study applied ctDNA WES to plasma from 20 EGA patients (pts) and standard WES to matched biopsies in order to assess ctDNA WES performance and whether clonal mutation burden (cMB), a critical immunotherapy biomarker and important for neoantigen vaccine designs, differed between ctDNA and biopsies. We furthermore established a mutation and copy number data analysis pipeline using Bayesian clustering to define subclones and track their evolution during therapy in 3pts.<br \/>Results: The median age of pts was 71y, 95% had distant metastases and 5% locally advanced EGAs. At a median sequencing depth of ????x after de-duplication, VFs of mutations in pre-treatment ctDNA was low (&#60;2% VF) in 8 pts, and intermediate (2-10%) to high (&#62;10%) in 12. Whether cMB differed in biopsies vs ctDNA was assessed in 7 pts with high VFs in ctDNA and good cancer purity in matching biopsy WES. The median cMB was 82 in biopsies and 111 in ctDNA. The increase was driven by 3 cases with 30%, 35% and 59% higher cMB in ctDNA vs biopsies. In two pts, most mutations that only appeared clonal in ctDNA were subclonal rather than absent in the primary tumor, indicating the subclonal presence of the metastasis progenitor clone. Subclonal intermixing in primary tumors hence limits the accurate identification of mutations that are clonal in metastatic disease. Evolutionary dynamics analyses in 3 pts who had good responses to chemotherapy before progression showed a major clonal sweep in one, supporting monoclonal resistance, and evolution of small subclones in two, indicating polyclonal resistance. A MEK1 K57T mutation evolved at resistance in a <i>HER2<\/i> amplified EGA treated with trastuzumab+chemotherapy, demonstrating the utility to identify mechanisms of acquired resistance.<br \/>Conclusions: ctDNA WES can assess the genetics of entire metastatic cancer cell populations over time and deconvolute their evolutionary trajectories. 43% pts had higher cMB in ctDNA compared to biopsies. Liquid biopsy analyses by WES may be superior to tissue-based WES for mutation burden analysis and neoantigen vaccine designs. ctDNA WES identified distinct evolutionary modes of resistance. A larger cohort is being analyzed to define how these differ clinically and whether they can be predicted from pre-treatment ctDNA WES. Efforts to increase the ctDNA WES sensitivity are ongoing as 8 pts had low ctDNA VFs which increased false negative rates.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,Tumor evolution,Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Neil McCafferty<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Caroline Fong<sup>2<\/sup>, Louise  J.

Predicting outcomes associated with cancer treatment is critical to PCa survivorship given that the 5-year survival rates for local and regional stage PCa is nearly 100%. Radiogenomics is a promising field of research focused on identifying genomic markers that can provide clinically useful prognostic predictions regarding radiation response and can potentially serve as the basis for personalized RT where cancer management is tailored to fit each individual patient. Circulating cell-free (ccfDNA) DNA has been found to 1) be associated with radiation sensitivity or toxicity, 2) relapse or recurrence, and 3) risk for the development of metastases before, during or following photon RT. Proton therapy, alternative to photon therapy, is a promising treatment that can reduce excess radiation dose and, in turn, the risk for adverse events. However, few studies have been done to determine if ccfDNA can predict response in proton radiation, which purports superior dose distribution, avoiding healthy tissues, minimizing the exit dose, and potentially reducing overall toxicity. The overall aim of this study is to determine if the quantity of ccfDNA is associated with PCa risk groups. We hypothesized that PCa patients within the highest risk group have quantitatively increased levels of ccfDNA compared to those in low and intermediate risk groups. This study leveraged the University of Florida Health Proton Therapy Institute Outcomes Tracking Protocol biobank of PCa patients with plasma and serum collected before, during and after proton RT. Isolation of ccfDNA at baseline, during treatment, and following treatment was undertaken and ccfDNA quantities were compared among patients in the low, intermediate and high risk groups using ANOVA. Our results indicate that the quantity difference between baseline and day 14 of treatment (p=0.055), 2 weeks post-treatment (p=0.54), and 4 weeks post-treatment (p=0.002) was associated with risk group. There was trend towards increasing ccfDNA quantity, as risk group increased; however, there was no correlation between risk group and treatment times using the Pearson correlation. Our results were consistent in that high ccfDNA quantity was associated with PCa risk. This is the first study determining the application of ccfDNA quantity on prostate cancer outcomes in patients undergoing proton RT. Identifying the determinants of radiation-related adverse outcomes will help inform impending predictive genomic technologies and improve cancer-related outcomes and survivorship.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Biomarkers,Circulating cell-free DNA,Radiation therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Andrew Bass<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Johnny Velasquez<sup>1<\/sup>, Moein Rajaei<sup>2<\/sup>, Curtis Bryant<sup>3<\/sup>, Nancy Mendenhall<sup>3<\/sup>, Luisel  J.

Circulating biomarkers offer a minimally invasive approach to monitor intra-patient tumor heterogeneity and detect in real-time the clinically-relevant evolving clonal architecture. Although currently underutilized, single-cell DNA next generation sequencing of circulating tumor cells (CTC) is a particularly suitable method to complement tissue and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Here we analyzed 113 individual CTC, 21 ctDNA, 15 white blood cells (WBC) samples and 15 tissue biopsies, from 15 CTC-positive lobular breast cancer patients. CTC were enriched with the CellSearch&#174; system and isolated as single cells with the DEPArray&#8482; system. CTC, WBC, and ctDNA underwent scNGS with the Oncomine Comprehensive Assay covering ~500 genes and 1.1Mb of genomic space to detect mutations, copy number alterations, tumor mutation burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI). 99.1% of single cells and 95.2% of ctDNA samples were informative. Our CTC-based precision medicine reporting platform, MI-CTCSeq, detected CTC in 9 of 15 patients (60%) with FDA-approved actionable alterations including in the oncogenes <i>PIK3CA<\/i> and <i>FGFR2<\/i> and HER2. 3 of these 9 (33%) harbored actionable alterations not shared between all 3 analyte types (tissue, CTC and ctDNA) including 3 actionable mutations found in CTC and ctDNA only, 1 in tissue and ctDNA only, and 1 in ctDNA only. Two of those ctDNA mutations were identified near the limit of detection and with a priori knowledge from tissue or CTC. Interestingly, 1 patient with plentiful CTC had no detectable ctDNA. Another patient&#8217;s tissue biopsy was inadequate for sequencing while both liquid biopsy analytes were abundant. 13 patients (87%) displayed intra-patient, inter-CTC genomic heterogeneity of driver mutations. 1 of 4 (25%) patients with CTC available in &#62;1 timepoint displayed fluctuations in their CTC subclonal makeup between timepoints. Data from this patient&#8217;s 2 tissue biopsies, 4 ctDNA samples, and 27 individual CTC over 6 timepoints, combined to reveal in unprecedented detail inter-metastatic lesion and inter-CTC heterogeneity and evolution in response to endocrine, chemo and immunotherapy selective pressures. In a novel approach we show detection of single-cell CTC TMB and MSI. CTC TMB was highly concordant (R 0.81) with the corresponding tissue biopsies. Further, in a novel observation, we detected intra patient, inter-CTC heterogeneity of TMB and MSI, which has potential implications for immunotherapy response and development of resistance. Taken together, these data support the non-invasive biomarker interrogation and monitoring by liquid biopsy that incorporates CTC to complement tissue in informing treatment approaches.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Circulating tumor cells,Precision medicine,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Andi K.

Current screening approaches for this disease have certain limitations; Pap tests require dedicated cytopathology infrastructure, while human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing may lead to invasive procedures in patients with transient infection. Liquid biopsy has emerged as a minimally invasive approach to detect and monitor disease progression and treatment response. We and others have previously demonstrated the clinical utility of circulating tumor (ct)DNA to monitor HPV+ cancers. Moreover, cell free (cf)DNA fragmentation patterns have been found to be a biomarker of disease burden. This cfDNA is thought to originate largely as a result of cell death, where small fragments of ~167 bp are associated with apoptosis and larger fragments (&#62;1000 bp) are associated with necrosis. Despite advances in liquid biopsy techniques, little is known about the composition of cfDNA from different analytes in CC patients.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The aim of this study was to compare the presence and composition of cfDNA from different liquid biopsy analytes in patients with CC and high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or dysplasia (CIN\/CD). Blood, urine, and vaginal swabs were collected from 20 patients with CC and 9 patients with CIN\/CD at the McGill University Health Centre. All samples were centrifuged twice to isolate supernatant. Samples were tested for HPV ctDNA by ddPCR. Analysis of fragment length was performed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. Dominant fragment was determined as the DNA fragment with the highest concentration, while overall fragment was calculated as the average fragment across all bioanalyzer peaks.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> HPV16\/18 ctDNA was detectable 14\/20 CC patients and 2\/6 CIN patients, and 0\/3 CD patients in plasma, urine, and vaginal swab. Concordance for all sample types tested was seen in 90% of cases. On average, fragment analysis demonstrated 174, 195, and 183 bp dominant small fragments in plasma, urine and vaginal swab, respectively. Plasma samples showed only smaller fragments (range: 168-187 bp). Other analytes displayed a predominance of larger cfDNA, with an overall fragment size of 3996 and 5194 bp in urine and vaginal swab, respectively.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> HPV-DNA was detectable in all analytes sampled in patients with CC and CIN, with a trend of higher detection in CC samples. The fragmentation patterns of cfDNA varied between patients and within patients across analytes, with larger fragments - likely of necrotic origin - seen only in urine and vaginal swab cfDNA. Smaller fragments - likely related to apoptosis - were seen across all sample types studied. Overall, analysis of fragmentation may provide valuable insight into cfDNA origins in different sample types and provide a novel biomarker for diagnosis and surveillance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Cervical cancer,cfDNA,Human papillomavirus (HPV),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sarah Tadhg Ferrier<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Erica Mandato<sup>1<\/sup>, Alexandra Bartolomucci<sup>1<\/sup>, Thupten Tsering<sup>1<\/sup>, Shuk On Annie Leung<sup>2<\/sup>, Julia Valdemarin Burnier<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>McGill University Health Centre Research Institute, Montreal, QC, Canada,<sup>2<\/sup>McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"17fa4d21-2e9b-4951-a731-8c013b4ff9f4","ControlNumber":"4841","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

However, cell-free DNA (cfDNA)-based alterations can be derived from the tumor, germline, or may be associated with clonal hematopoiesis (CH), which can confound non-invasive tumor profiling, molecular response assessment, and clonal evolution analyses through inaccurate variant classification. To facilitate global access to a decentralized liquid biopsy solution to address this, we developed and validated the 521 gene PGDx elio plasma complete test for paired analysis of cfDNA and matched leukocyte DNA. PGDx elio plasma complete enables detection of single nucleotide variants, insertions and deletions, copy number amplifications, translocations, microsatellite instability, blood tumor mutation burden, and loss of heterozygosity. We first optimized the assay workflow to incorporate genomic DNA derived from leukocytes to facilitate direct detection and characterization of germline alterations as well as those that may be associated with CH, resulting in de-duplicated, error-corrected sequencing coverage of approximately 1,750-fold. A fully automated bioinformatics algorithm was then developed and validated to perform integrated analyses of cfDNA-derived alterations to assign the appropriate biological source of these variants. To assess the impact of these paired sample analyses, we analyzed the blood samples obtained from 24 patients representing seven different solid tumor types (breast, colorectal, gastric, gastro-esophageal junction, lung, and melanoma). Across this cohort, of the alterations detected in cfDNA (n=322), 87.3% were correctly classified as somatic, germline or CH without the patient-matched normal blood sample. Specifically, of the variants that were determined to be associated with CH (n=26), only 35% were appropriately assigned without the paired comparison. Additional sources of discordance for somatic and germline alterations were primarily attributed to patients with high levels of ctDNA where differentiation of these variant sources can be challenging through solely computational-based techniques. Taken together, these data demonstrate that through the integrated analysis of cell-free DNA and matched leukocyte DNA, classification of the source of cfDNA-derived alterations can be achieved, which may improve the accuracy of non-invasive tumor profiling, molecular response assessment, and clonal evolution analyses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Advanced cancer,Cancer genetics,Circulating cell-free DNA,Next-Generation Sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Tonya  N.

Mouse models have been especially useful tools to investigate the process of metastasis, since they are easier to control and are less variable compared to clinical patient samples. Therefore, it is of interest to extract and study CTCs and CTC clusters from such mouse models. However, most isolation systems are designed and tested for human blood and cell lines. Sized-based methods of CTC isolation have been optimized for human cell lines, but mouse CTCs are generally smaller in size (i.e., ~14 &#181;m EO771 breast cancer cells). Therefore, mouse cell separation necessitates a varied protocol for CTC isolation. We used mouse blood and EO771, a mouse breast cancer cell line, to demonstrate the isolation of mouse CTCs from mouse blood using a sized-based microfluidic device. We also validated the presence of endogenous CTCs and CTC-neutrophil clusters in a tumor bearing mouse model.<br \/><b>Methods. <\/b>Our microfluidic device employs inertial migration in a straight channel segment (150 &#181;m &#215; 50 &#181;m &#215; 24 mm) to isolate CTCs from blood samples. We spiked 100 and 1000 ZsGreen-expressing EO771 cells in 5&#215; diluted blood containing tdTomato-expressing neutrophils, easily distinguishing CTCs from the red-colored neutrophils. To enumerate the recovered cells, we used Cytospin to concentrate the cells into a glass slide. Lastly, we used hydrodynamic traps to capture CTC clusters from tumor-bearing mouse blood. The blood was extracted from the posterior vena cava of the mice at the endpoint experiment.<br \/><b>Results.<\/b> We achieved an overall recovery rate of 22-29%, which combines the recovery of the isolation device and the Cytospin. Here, we enumerate cells only after their extraction from the collection tube outside of the isolation device. Other methods with higher capture efficiency enumerate the recovered CTCs before they are harvested from the isolation device which is not always representative of the number of cells that are analyzed. We were also able to discover endogenous CTC-neutrophil clusters from tumor-bearing mice which we distinguished apart with anti-EpCAM staining of CTCs (green) and anti-Ly6G (red) staining of neutrophils.<br \/><b>Conclusion. <\/b>We demonstrated and optimized a procedure for isolating mouse-derived CTCs from na&#239;ve mice blood and CTC-neutrophil clusters from tumor-bearing mice with our microfluidic isolation devices, as opposed to the isolation of human CTCs as in other sized-based isolation systems.

Therefore, the genomic information should be used for minimal residual disease (MRD) detection, which directly leads to improved post-treatment cancer patient management. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a small fraction of DNA present in blood that carries somatic mutations in cancer patients. Our previous studies demonstrated the clinical validity of ctDNA as a tumor marker for MRD detection. However, the variant allele frequency (VAF; reflecting the fraction of somatic mutations) of ctDNA is less than 1%, at which stable detection is difficult for NGS. Instead of NGS, we have established a highly sensitive ctDNA monitoring system for MRD detection using an originally developed library of &#62;1000 digital PCR (dPCR) probes.<br \/>Patients and Methods: Using a Clinical Institutional Review Board approval from the Iwate Medical University Hospital, we initiated a dPCR assay system, called off-the-shelf (OTS)-Assay, in April 2022 under a partnership with Quantdetect, Inc (Tokyo, Japan). The OTS-Assay has three main components: OTS-Scan, OTS-Select, and OTS-Monitor. The OTS-Scan can provide an original CGP if a patient comes with no CGP results. The OTS-Select chooses matched somatic mutations from our dPCR probe library. The OTS-Monitor quantifies VAFs of ctDNA periodically in the patient plasma with a sensitivity of 0.05% VAF. There is no strict patient eligibility criteria other than the requirement of previous therapy for treatment of an advanced cancer.<br \/>Results: Between April and November 2022, 26 patients visited Iwate Medical University Hospital for the OTS-Assay. Twenty-five patients were referred from other Departments of Iwate Medical University Hospital. The primary cancer types include esophagus (n=21), colorectal (n=2), pancreas (n=2), and breast (n=1). Twenty patients had CGP results at their first visit. OTS-Select were used for 13 patients and picked an average of 11.4 mutations per patient. Among those, each of eight patients were immediately able to start ctDNA monitoring with one of the 1000 dPCR probes. As of November 2022, there are four patients who received OTS-Monitor more than one time. Any unexpected VAF increase of ctDNA has not been noted, although a substantial decrease of ctDNA VAF was found in one patient who received one cycle of chemotherapy.<br \/>Conclusion: The OTS-Assay is a practical introduction of our previous clinical research products based on a core technology, which uses an originally developed library of &#62;1000 dPCR probes. The potential of early and accurate MRD detection will improve post-treatment cancer patient management.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Satoshi S.

Evaluation of treatment efficacy and early detection of relapse are therefore major clinical challenges.<br \/>Methods: We present a clinical update of a previously described cohort of 68 patients who received NAC prior to RC (NAC cohort; Christensen et al. JCO 2019; median follow-up (FU) of 58 months) together with evaluation of a retrospectively collected cohort of 120 patients who did not receive NAC (no-NAC cohort; median FU of 71 months). Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) was analyzed before NAC (NAC cohort, n=63), prior to RC (NAC cohort, n=67; no-NAC cohort, n=115) and after RC (NAC cohort, n=66; no-NAC cohort, n=37) using Signatera&#8482;. RNA-seq was performed on 176 tumors.<br \/>Results: Updated clinical FU for the NAC cohort showed that ctDNA-positive patients had significantly worse recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared to ctDNA-negative patients (before NAC: HR=16, 95%CI=3.6-70.5, <i>p<\/i>=0.0002; during surveillance after RC: HR=27.6, 95%CI=7.9-96.9, <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.0001). After NAC prior to RC, 84% (52\/62) of patients were ctDNA-negative, and of these 81% (42\/52) achieved pathological complete response (pCR), while none of the ctDNA-positive patients achieved pCR (PPV 100%; NPV 81%). For the no-NAC cohort, presence of ctDNA was also prognostic at both time points (before RC: HR=2.5, 95%CI=1.4-4.4, <i>p<\/i>=0.001; single time point after RC: HR=10.1, 95%CI=3.2-31.6, <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.0001). In both cohorts, transcriptomic pathway analysis showed an enrichment of oncogenic pathways, namely EMT and hypoxia (<i>q<\/i>&#60;0.0001), in tumors from ctDNA-positive patients (n=62\/142). This may reflect a more aggressive cancer phenotype of ctDNA shedding tumors. Among those who were ctDNA-positive after NAC (n=7) we found enrichment of EMT (<i>q<\/i>&#60;0.0001) and TGF-&#946; signaling (<i>q<\/i>=0.005), whereas there was enrichment of anti-tumor immune pathways, including IFN&#945; and IFN&#947; response (<i>q<\/i>=0.03 and <i>q<\/i>=0.04), in patients with ctDNA clearance after NAC (n=11). Similarly, we found upregulation of IFN&#945; and IFN&#947; response pathways (<i>q<\/i>&#60;0.0001) in ctDNA-negative patients without relapse in the no-NAC cohort (n=34\/57). Finally, we classified all tumors according to the MIBC consensus classes and found more Ba\/Sq tumors among the ctDNA-positive patients (<i>p<\/i>&#60;0.0001). We are currently investigating the potential clinical benefit of receiving NAC in ctDNA-positive and -negative patients by comparing the NAC and no-NAC treated patients.<br \/>Conclusion: Presence of ctDNA was associated with worse prognosis for both NAC and no-NAC treated patients. Transcriptomic analysis of primary tumors showed that anti-tumor immune responses may be associated with a particularly good outcome whereas EMT may be promoting more aggressive disease. <i> <\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Circulating tumor DNA,Prognostic markers,RNA sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sia Viborg Lindskrog<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, George Laliotis<sup>2<\/sup>, Karin Birkenkamp-Demtröder<sup>1<\/sup>, Iver Nordentoft<sup>1<\/sup>, Philippe Lamy<sup>1<\/sup>, Elshaddai Z.

Additionally, liquid biopsy can be used in NGS to detect genetic variants in circulating tumor DNA and RNA. Liquid biopsy is a less invasive option compared to traditional biopsy methods for early detection and continuous monitoring of cancer treatment outcomes. Here, we discuss screening of over 3,500 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples, and the analytical validation of the Oncomine&#8482; Dx Express Test (ODxET) and Genexus&#8482; Dx Integrated Sequencer for detection of clinically significant variants in liquid biopsy samples.<br \/><b>Methods - <\/b>Our team screened over 3,500 NSCLC liquid biopsy samples in search of high priority clinical variants. Variants selected for analytical validation studies included ERBB2 exon 20 insertion, EGFR exon 20 insertion, EGFR exon 19 deletion, EGFR T790M, KRAS G12C, BRAF V600E, and RNA fusion isoforms including ALK, NTRK1\/2\/3, RET, and ROS1 oncogenic drivers. Over 550 screened samples were found to be positive for these variants of interest. This screening was performed on the Genexus&#8482; Dx Integrated Sequencer according to the user guide.<br \/><b>Results - <\/b>The Genexus&#8482; Dx Integrated Sequencer automates library preparation, sequencing, analysis, and reporting QC metrics and variant calls. Sequencing run setup is quick and straightforward, taking less than 15 minutes to start a run and just over 24 hours to go from nucleic acid to report. Limit of detection (LoD) for DNA SNVs, insertions, and deletions at 5 ng DNA input level ranged from 0.65% to 1.82% allelic frequency (AF), depending on the variant. The higher DNA input of 30 ng resulted in a lower LoD range, from 0.31% to 0.42% AF. RNA fusion and splice variant LoD at 5 ng sample input ranged from 9.9 to 19.6 molecular counts. The higher 30 ng input resulted in a lower LoD range for RNA variants as well, ranging from 6.4 to 8.0 molecular counts. In the analytical accuracy study, the false positive rate was found to be 0.2% for SNVs, 0% for insertions\/deletions, and 0% for fusion targets. In the analytical reproducibility study, the average with-in run repeatability call rate (No Calls excluded) was 99.64% for DNA variants and 98.75% for RNA variants.<br \/><b>Conclusion - <\/b>Here, we demonstrated that the ODxET workflow on Genexus&#8482; Dx Integrated Sequencer is a fast and efficient tool for testing clinical NSCLC liquid biopsy samples with high sensitivity and specificity.<br \/><b><sup>For in vitro diagnostic use.

Circulating tumor cells (CTC) are individual cells or clusters that can move from tumors to circulation invading other tissues. Often cells in the tumor need to adapt to low oxygen levels, generating a population of cells known as hypoxic cells that can survive low oxygen levels. These hypoxic cells can produce more cell junction proteins, augmenting connections between cells causing them to break away in clusters rather than individually. Clustered CTCs are much more efficient at metastasis formation. Release of CTC can also be stimulated by cancer treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy. To date, our research has generated in-vitro studies with a set of 3-nitrobenzazolo[3,2- a]quinolinium chloride salts (NBQS) demonstrating its capacity as markers of hypoxic human cancer cells in vitro. Comparison with the control Pimonidazole demonstrated the advantages of novel NBQ-TOM compounds as hypoxic marker. We here, aim to test the applicability of NBQS to identify hypoxic cells among circulating tumor cells (H-CTC). To date limited commercially CTC detection methods are available. Our application can be described as pre-clinical detection technology of hypoxic cancer cells serving also in cancer management. To determine the capacity of novel compound, NBQ-345 TOM as hypoxic fluorescent marker, colon tumor cells (COLO 205) are culture under hypoxic and aerobic environment and treated with NBQ-345TOM (25uM) for 24 hours. After treatment fluorescence is measured with an OPTIMA BMG Fluorimeter. Fluorescence emission results demonstrated significant formation of the NBQ-234 TOM fluorescent metabolite on hypoxic tumor cells in contrast to cells treated under aerobic environment. Also, fluorescence microscopy analysis of colon cancer cells treated for 24 hours with NBQ-345 TOM at hypoxic and aerobic conditions confirmed the stronger fluorescence generation at hypoxic conditions in contrast to cells at aerobic conditions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hypoxia,Circulating tumor cells,Diagnosis,Metastatic potential,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Beatriz Zayas<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Karoline Rios<sup><\/sup>, Luis Ortiz<sup><\/sup>, Osvaldo Cox<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Science, Technology and Environment, University Ana G Mendez, San Juan, PR","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b7bb31a9-af42-4925-a404-d0598fafceff","ControlNumber":"6497","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>B.

We tested new methods for v-CTCs detection in patients (pts) with pancreatic cancer (PC), and investigated the clinical potential of v-CTCs in prognosis. We analyzed the PD-L1(L1) expression in primary PC tumors, metastatic lymph nodes (LN) and v-CTCs.<br \/>Pts and Methods: 7.5 ml of venous blood was collected from 39 PC pts, either upfront surgery (U group) or pre-treatment, consisted of Gem:800mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>; and S-1:80mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> given concurrently with IMRT to 60Gy ((NACRT:N group). To detect v-CTCs, we employed a telomerase-specific replication-selective adenovirus expressing GFP. For U group, samples were obtained before\/after resection. For N group, samples were obtained before\/after NACRT and after resection. To distinguish between leucocyte and cells with either epithelial or mesenchymal origin, cells were stained by anti-CD45, anti-Cytokeratin and anti-Vimentin Abs. GFP-positive and CD45-negative cells were counted as v-CTCs. To assess L1 expression in PC tissues (PC tumors and LN) and on v-CTCs, L1 IHC kit (22C3, for tissues) and anti-human L1 mAb(MIH1, for CTCs) were employed.<br \/>Results: U group: 24 pts aged 53~85 years (male\/female=12\/12) were enrolled. 24 pts underwent curative resection. No v-CTCs were detected in 6 pts at both before and after resection, and 5 of 6 pts survived without recurrence. V-CTCs were identified in 18 of 24 pts, and 13 of 18 pts developed liver metastasis. Marked decrease of CTC counts were seen after resection in 10 of 18 pts, but 9 pts developed recurrences. N group: 15 PC pts aged 44~77 years (male\/female=4\/11) were enrolled. 15 pts underwent curative resection. No v-CTCs at 3 sampling points were detected in 5 pts, and 5 pts survived without recurrences. V-CTCs was identified in 10 of 15 pts, and 4 out of 10 pts developed disease recurrence. Marked increase in CTC counts was observed after NACRT in 5 of 6 CTC-positive pts before NACRT, and 3 of 5 pts developed liver metastasis and died. NACRT may induce tumor cell dissemination into the blood circulation for CTC-positive pts. PD-L1 expression: L1 expression were assessed for 21 pts (U group:18, N group: 3). For PC tumors, L1 molecules were expressed in 12 pts and expression level of these pts were all low (57%, &#8805;50% [high]=0 pts, 1-49% [low]=12 pts {10%=6, 20%=4, 40%=2}, &#60;1% [negative]=9 pts). For metastatic LNs, metastatic LNs were observed in 14 pts and L1-positive expression in these LNs were detected in only 4 pts (28%, all low expression). On the contrary, the majority of detected v-CTCs clearly expressed L1 molecule (92 CTCs out of 103 detected CTCs were L1-positive=89 %).<br \/>Conclusions: Viable CTC detection appears as a good prognostic marker.

It is unclear if ctDNA testing is sensitive in detection of recurrent PCCC ahead of clinical\/radiological presentation.<br \/>We report data from 6 CRC patients with PCCC who underwent complete CRS and were followed with serial ctDNA testing.<br \/>Methods: In this single institution study, patients with PCCC were included from our prospectively enrolled GI cancer patient cohort (GIMER: IRB #201202743). Peritoneal carcinomatosis at CRS was determined using the Peritoneal Cancer Index. ctDNA concentration in mean tumor molecules\/mL of plasma was assessed using a commercially available tumor-informed, personalized ctDNA assay (Signatera&#8482;, Natera, Inc.) that uses patient-specific somatic single-nucleotide variants. Plasma samples for ctDNA analysis were collected before surgery, 1, 2, 4, 6 months post-surgery, then every 3 months until a positive ctDNA test triggered CT imaging. Patients also had routine CT imaging every 6 months after surgery.<br \/>Results: 5 of 6 patients met endpoint with median time of 35 days from positive ctDNA to recurrence on imaging. In 4 patients, positive ctDNA prompted CT imaging which was negative, but follow-up PET scan was positive. Patient 6 was ctDNA negative and recurrence-free at last follow-up.<br \/>Conclusions: This analysis demonstrated the potential of longitudinal ctDNA monitoring for early detection of PCCC recurrence by prompting early imaging. PET was more sensitive in detecting recurrence than CT, and should be considered when determining PCCC recurrence. Enrollment and further analysis of ctDNA continues.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{BEBE0BB7-0AE5-4DD0-8B4E-FF83CDB31EEB}\"><caption>Table 1<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Patient<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Pre-op Chemo<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Post-chemo, pre-op ctDNA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Peritoneal Cancer Index<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Post-op (1m) ctDNA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2m ctDNA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4m ctDNA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6m ctDNA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9m ctDNA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">12m ctDNA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">15m ctDNA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Recurrence<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Days between ctDNA positivity and positive imaging<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Imaging Findings<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Yes<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.48<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Yes<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CT CAP Positive<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Yes<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.04<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Yes<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">54<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CT CAP Negative;

This is accelerating the cancer research field towards the development of multianalyte-based <i>in vitro<\/i> diagnostic tests for early detection and\/or monitoring of cancer. These multianalyte liquid biopsy tests are often based on detection of cancer-related proteins and\/or tumor-specific genomic and transcriptomic changes (circulating cell-free nucleic acids) in plasma. A specialized and proprietary stabilization reagent has been developed for use in a blood collection tube with the capability to simultaneously stabilize protein biomarkers of interest and cell-free nucleic acids.<br \/>Methods: Blood samples from self-proclaimed healthy donors were drawn into evacuated blood collection tubes containing a new stabilization reagent and stored at room temperature. Plasma was isolated using a general double-spin protocol (1800 &#215;g for 15 min and 2800 &#215;g for 15 min) and frozen at -80 &#176;C until use. Plasma levels of proteins of interest including cancer markers and immuno-oncology checkpoint markers were measured by Ella Simple Plex Assays (Bio-Techne) and Luminex xMAP&#174; Technology Assays (Bio-Techne, samples tested by LuminexPLORE Lab). Total cell-free nucleic acids were isolated using the QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit and the resultant cfDNA or cfRNA was analyzed with fluorometric-based assay (quantitative) and Bioanalyzer \/ Tapestation (qualitative).<br \/>Results: Compared with blood samples collected in EDTA and ACD-A tubes, the new stabilization reagent maintained the draw time levels of plasma proteins of interest such as TGF-&#946;1, MMP-9, IL-8\/CXCL8, CCL5\/RANTES, Granzyme B, CEA and PD-L1 for up to 5 days of room temperature storage in whole blood. The reagent also effectively maintained draw time levels of plasma cell-free nucleic acids to near draw time levels. In addition, the new reagent also minimized <i>in vitro<\/i> hemolysis during room temperature storage.<br \/>Conclusion: This new and breakthrough stabilization reagent simultaneously maintains the draw time levels of proteins of interest and cell-free nucleic acids for an extended period of time in whole blood. It provides cancer researchers and clinical assay developers confidence in blood sample integrity and flexibility in sample storage, transport, and processing at ambient temperature for multianalyte analysis or multiomics profiling.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Proteomics,Cell-free DNA,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jing Li<sup><\/sup>, Lisa Bartron<sup><\/sup>, Jordan LaRue<sup><\/sup>, Sama Mehta<sup><\/sup>, <b>Nicholas  M.

Tumor-derived sequence mutations and plasma aneuploidy were tracked longitudinally using a tumor-agnostic WBC DNA-informed approach and combined to evaluate changes in total cell-free tumor load (cfTL). Dynamic changes in cfTL were monitored for each patient to determine circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) molecular response during therapy.<br \/>Results: Longitudinal assessment of cfTL dynamics allowed for the evaluation of molecular response in all patients studied. Overall, 9 patients were classified as molecular responders based on sustained complete elimination of cfTL. For 14 patients, we observed initial molecular responses, followed by cfTL recrudescence. In a subset of 10 patients we observed a distinct pattern of molecular progression characterized by cfTL persistence across all timepoints analyzed. Patients with sustained molecular responses attained longer overall (OS; log-rank p=0.0006) and progression-free (PFS; log-rank p&#60;0.0001) survival, with molecular responses detected on average 4 weeks earlier than imaging. Importantly, ctDNA molecular response remained the most significant predictor of OS (molecular response vs molecular progression HR=0.09, 95% CI=0.02-0.42, p=0.002; molecular response f\/b recrudescence vs molecular progression HR=0.14, 95% CI=0.04-0.48, p=0.002) and PFS (molecular response vs molecular progression HR=0.02, 95% CI=0.00-0.16, p&#60;0.001; molecular response f\/b recrudescence vs molecular progression HR=0.05, 95% CI=0.01-0.26, p&#60;0.001) after adjustment for clinical covariates in a multivariate cox proportional hazards regression model. Analysis of landmark OS and PFS endpoints revealed that molecular responses more accurately predicted OS at 12 (AUC 78.1% vs 73.3%) and 64 months (AUC 87.3% vs 67.6%) and PFS at 3 (AUC 91.7% vs 82.0%) and 12 months (AUC 83.5% vs 78.8%) compared to conventional imaging.<br \/>Conclusions: Longitudinal tracking of sequence and structural ctDNA features provide an accurate and rapid approach to track changes in tumor burden and prognosticate outcomes during systemic therapy in patients with SCLC. These findings suggest that therapeutic response monitoring based on combined molecular response criteria may be used to provide guidance on clinical decision making for patients with SCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: small cell,Biomarkers,Liquid biopsies,Circulating tumor DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lavanya Sivapalan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Wade  T.
