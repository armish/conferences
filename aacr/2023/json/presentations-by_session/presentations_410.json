[{"Abstract":"The integrated stress response (ISR) is an adaptive signaling pathway that cells utilize to respond to a wide range of extrinsic and intrinsic stresses, which are important for tumorigenesis. Activation of ISR is suggested to play a dual role in cell fate decisions. While the ISR promotes survival, prolonged activation of ISR induces apoptosis. We are developing HC-7366, a first-in-class, first-in-human GCN2 activator, and are currently evaluating it in a phase 1 clinical trial in solid tumors (NCT05121948). In this study, we present the characterization of the antitumor effects of HC-7366 in solid tumors.<br \/><i>In vivo<\/i> efficacy studies using HC-7366 montherapy showed significant tumor growth inhibition (TGI%) in preclinical cancer models of colorectal (78-95%), head and neck (33% regression), sarcoma (80%) and prostate (65%). HC-7366 activated the ISR in tumors from treated mice as evidenced by induction of the ATF4 target genes ASNS and PSAT1. Additionally, HC-7366 induced the proapoptotic protein PUMA and reduced HIF1&#9082; and HIF2&#9082; levels. Furthermore, HC-7366 showed significant benefit in colorectal models when combined with DC101 (anti-VEGFR2 antibody), 5-fluorouracil (chemotherapy), alpelisib (PI3K&#945; inhibitor), or trametinib (MEK1\/2 inhibitor). Using GCN2 CRISPR-knockout cells, we confirmed that the HC-7366 mediated reduction of cell growth and induction of ISR markers was dependent on GCN2. We performed multi-omics analyses to further understand the mechanism of action. Metabolomics analysis of tumors treated with HC-7366 revealed that HC-7366 altered several metabolites involved in amino acid metabolism, oxidative stress, the urea cycle, and pyrimidine biosynthesis. Additionally, proteomics analysis showed that HC-7366 significantly reduced proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Analysis of the transcriptome in tumors from treated mice demonstrated that HC-7366 reduced the activity of HIF and E2F1-driven transcription, including expression of metaphase-anaphase transition genes, consistent with decreased Ki67 staining in tumors. ATF4 and JUN transcriptional activity was enhanced with HC-7366 treatment consistent with activation of ISR. Collectively, our <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> results demonstrate that HC-7366 is a potent GCN2 activator with strong antitumor activity across multiple solid tumor models as a monotherapy or in combination with standard of care agents.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stress response,ATF4,Combination studies,Metabolomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Feven Tameire<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Paulina Wojnarowicz<sup>1<\/sup>, Crissy Dudgeon<sup>1<\/sup>, Sho Fujisawa<sup>1<\/sup>, Sharon Huang<sup>1<\/sup>, Owen  B.

A migration assay was done using a Transwell chamber, and MMP-2 was measured with its specific ELISA kit.

The <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy of UPA was examined in uterine sarcoma cell line- and patient-derived xenograft mice models.<br \/>Results: UPA inhibited cell growth and increased apoptosis in cell lines including uterine sarcoma (MES-SA) and leiomyosarcoma (SK-UT-1 and SK-LMS-1) in a dose-dependent manner. UPA also inhibited cell migration and the expression of MMP-2. cDNA microarray analysis revealed that CCL2 was commonly down-regulated by UPA in investigated cell lines. The UPA-mediated inhibition of CCL2 expression was confirmed by ELISA. The phosphorylation and the total expression of STAT3, downstream from the CCL2 signaling pathway, was also inhibited by UPA. We also found that UPA reduced cell growth and increased caspase-3 activity in primary culture cells from leiomyosarcoma patient-derived xenografts (PDX-C). Moreover, we found that STAT3\/CCL2 inhibition by UPA was independent of the expression of progesterone receptor. <i>In vivo<\/i> studies with MES-SA and SK-UT-1 cell line-derived xenografts and a PDX model with leiomyosarcoma demonstrated that UPA significantly decreased tumor growth.<br \/>Conclusions: UPA had significant anti-tumor effects in uterine sarcoma through the STAT3\/CCL2 signaling pathway and might be a potential therapeutic agent to treat this disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Uterine carcinosarcoma,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT),CCL2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jae Ryoung Hwang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Young-Jae Cho<sup>1<\/sup>, Ji-Yoon Ryu<sup>1<\/sup>, Ju-Yeon Choi<sup>1<\/sup>, Jung-Joo Choi<sup>2<\/sup>, Jeong-Won Lee<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4f15d4fb-ee4b-4fdb-942f-8b4605b644e1","ControlNumber":"999","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Recent studies suggest OMX may be effective against other cancer types with high rates of protein translation, and may be successful against protein targets that are difficult to inhibit by reducing their translation rates. Using both canine and human osteosarcoma (OS) cell lines, we have investigated the efficacy of OMX against osteosarcoma and expression of c-MYC. OMX provides significant growth inhibition of OS cells with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values in the low nanomolar range. OMX also reduces migration and invasion capabilities of OS cells. Strikingly, we observed reduction in levels of c-MYC protein in most canine and human OS cell lines after OMX exposure. This reduction was both dose and time dependent. We also investigated the efficacy of OMX against OS in an orthotopic mouse OS model. OMX is a promising candidate for treatment of OS in both dogs and humans, and potentially additional cancers dependent on c-MYC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Myc,Omacetaxine,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kristen  B.

Since integrins require the dimerization between an alpha and beta subunit to function, we developed a CRISPR library targeting all 26 alpha and beta subunits to identify which pair is the most important. We found a strong correlation between ITGAV and ITGB5 (Integrin Beta 5), which form a known heterodimer, in solid tumors. CRISPR targeting either ITGAV or ITGB5 led to attenuated cell proliferation with increased cell cycle stalling and apoptosis. As the more essential partner, we designed a CRISPR tiling scan targeting the entire coding region of ITGAV and determine the essential nature of each amino acid. We found a sub-domain within the beta propeller to be important for ITGAV function, the CRISPR identified pocket (CIP). Genetic targeting of this pocket disrupted the ability to detect the heterodimer signal of ITGAV-ITGB5 by a specific antibody. Furthermore, we confirmed that essential amino acids within the CIP responsible for the heterodimer stability by the NanoBRET energy transfer system. Knowing the role of the CIP in heterodimer stability we searched for a small molecule to bind in the CIP to phenocopy our genetic findings. A combined <i>in-silico <\/i>and <i>in-vitro <\/i>high throughput drug screen started tested compounds for cell killing and disruption of the ITGAV-ITGB5 heterodimer. &#8220;Compound 2&#8221; (cpd_2) showed both strong cell killing and dissociation of the heterodimer. Disruption was measured by detection by flow cytometry and through the NanoBRET system. Cpd_2&#8217;s binding was confirmed with thermal shift studies with purified ITGAV beta propeller, validating that this compound is behaving and binding as we expect at the CIP. Next, we sought to understand how the ITGAV-ITGB5 heterodimer controls cancer cell survival. From the Dependency Map Public database (DepMap) we found that Rac1 dependency is significantly correlated only with ITGAV and ITGB5. We hypothesized that this meant that ITGAV-ITGB5 regulated Rac1 activity. Loss of Rac1 phenocopies knock out of ITGAV or ITGB5 and loss of either Rac1 or ITGAV led to dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton, a known downstream feature of Rac1. A constitutively Rac1 (CA_Rac1) rescues the effects of targeting of ITGAV or treatment with cpd_2. Altogether this data suggests that ITGAV-ITGB5 signals to Rac1 and that attenuation of their function can be reversed by an active Rac1 In summary, our study highlights a novel strategy of targeting the integrin heterodimer ITGAV-ITGB5 with a small molecule binding to a novel subdomain, CIP, of ITGAV. The CIP is responsible for the heterodimer stability of ITGAV and ITGB5. Disruption of this heterodimer led to the dysregulation of Rac1 and destabilization of the actin cytoskeleton. This mechanism highlights a novel strategy for targeting integrins as a therapeutic target in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Integrins,Drug-discovery screen,Systems biology,Rac,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nicole Mattson<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kazuya Miyashita<sup><\/sup>, Anthony Chan<sup><\/sup>, Lu Yang<sup><\/sup>, Sheela Pangeni Pokharel<sup><\/sup>, Wei Liu<sup><\/sup>, Mingli Li<sup><\/sup>, Qiao Liu<sup><\/sup>, Xiaobao Xu<sup><\/sup>, Priyanka Singh<sup><\/sup>, Leisi Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Mingye Feng<sup><\/sup>, Chun-Wei Chen<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute of The City of Hope, Monrovia, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e0a39076-20c5-49d1-8cab-13d9dc76b79d","ControlNumber":"2046","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

However, only a fraction of patients respond to immunotherapy and cancer cells escape immunosurveillance through molecular mechanisms that remain elusive. Proteasomes play a central role in the immune response by generating peptides from intracellular antigens which are presented on the cell surface for recognition by CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Malignant cells employ strategies to downregulate antigen presentation and impair CTL-mediated tumor recognition and lysis. Recently, we discovered that HDAC6-specific inhibitors increased intracellular proteasome activity and the generation of antigenic class I MHC peptides. However, current HDAC6 inhibitors have pharmacologic liabilities that limit efficacy, e.g., low potency and solubility, poor pharmacokinetic properties and potential genotoxicity. Therefore, we performed a cell-based, high-throughput screen (HTS) of 9,600 HDAC-specific compounds to identify novel compounds that increased proteasomal activity in myeloma cells. We identified 8 hits that increased proteasomal activity at least two-fold. Importantly, two novel molecules identified in the HTS increased proteasome activity more potently and more rapidly than the HDAC6-specific inhibitors Tubastatin-A and ACY-1215 (Ricolinostat) with comparatively low cytotoxicity. Proteasomes degrade chicken ovalbumin (Ova) to generate the immunodominant antigen SIINFEKL presented at the cell surface complexed with the MHC-class I molecule H-2K<sup>b<\/sup>. Treatment of tumor cells with Tubastatin-A and ACY-1215 increased levels of the MHC-class I-SIINFEKL complex by ~3-fold. Tumor cells were pretreated with Tubastatin-A and ACY-1215 and then co-cultured with CTLs that had been genetically-engineered to express a SIINFEKL-restricted T-cell receptor (TCR). Pre-treatment of lymphoma or multiple myeloma cells with novel HDAC6 inhibitors also increased tumor lysis by CTLs that expressed the SIINFEKL-restricted TCR by 2-fold. Taken together, our results support repositioning pharmacologics that inhibit HDAC6 to activate proteasomal generation of antigenic peptides and boost antigen presentation as cancer immunotherapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HDAC inhibitor,Novel anticancer agents,Cytotoxic T lymphocytes,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Priyanka  S.

Although most of the patients have good prognosis and good life expectancy with standard treatments, recurrence rate and five-year survival rate have not been significantly improved in patients with bladder cancer, demonstrating there is an urgent need for development of a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of bladder cancer.

Our results showed that SP-2 induces accumulation of cells at subG1 phase in parallel with increase of early apoptotic cells via annexin V\/PI staining and activation of cell apoptotic death proteins. Moreover, non-cytotoxic concentrations of SP-2 induces LC3-II formation and p62 downregulation to activate autophagy in RT112 cells, suggesting autophagy may play a role in SP-2 -induced cell death.

NRF2 is frequently mutated and activated in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), which drives resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Therefore, a great need exists for NRF2 inhibitors for targeted therapy of NRF2<sup>high<\/sup> ESCC.<br \/>Design: We performed high-throughput screening of two compound libraries from which hit compounds were further validated in human ESCC cells and a genetically modified mouse model. Mechanism of action of one compound was explored by biochemical assays.<br \/>Results: Using high-throughput screening of two small molecule compound libraries, we identified 11 hit compounds as potential NRF2 inhibitors with minimal cytotoxicity at specified concentrations. We then validated two of these compounds, pyrimethamine and mitoxantrone, by demonstrating their dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effects on the expression of NRF2 and its target genes in two <i>NRF2<sup>Mut<\/sup><\/i> human ESCC cells (KYSE70 and KYSE180). RNAseq and qPCR confirmed the suppression of global NRF2 signaling by these two compounds.

Therefore inhibition of HPK1 is an attractive approach for the immunotherapy of cancers. ABM-2752 has a unique chemical structure that was potent on the HPK1, and selective over other MAP4K family members. It showed dose-dependent inhibition of SLP-76 phosphorylation and induction of IL-2, with good ADME and animal PK properties. In vivo efficacy was demonstrated in murine colorectal MC38 and CT26 syngeneic models as a single agent, enhanced by aPD-1. Treatment of ABM-2752 in these two models also improved animal overall survival. Other efficacy studies in murine melanoma B16F10 model and glioblastoma GL261 orthotopic model showed good efficacy and safety, demonstrating its good brain penetration in animals.

Although highly potent, the currently approved antitumor agents targeting tubulin present some drawbacks such as the development of acquired resistances, which remain an obstacle for an effective prolonged anticancer treatment. In this work, we present a novel microtubule destabilizing agent with an optimized interaction for the colchicine site and a novel mechanism of action which confers it a high affinity binding for tubulin.<br \/>Methods and Results: We have determined the X-ray crystallographic structure of the complex T<sub>2<\/sub>R-TTL with PM534 at a resolution of 2.45 &#197;. We unequivocally found PM534 ligand density at the intra-dimer interface between &#945; and &#946; tubulin of both tubulin dimers (the colchicine domain) within the complex. The colchicine domain of tubulin can be divided into three zones: a central pocket and two accessories. Whereas other colchicine site-ligands only bind to two of the zones, we found that PM534 binds extensively along the three zones, making multiple contacts with &#946;-tubulin N terminal domain, central hinge helix, and the intermediate domain. PM534 interaction did not affect the overall curved conformation of tubulin and its mechanism of action consists on precluding the curve-to-straight conformational transition required for tubulin to assemble intro microtubules and thus, to perform its cellular functions. In competition assays we found that the compound displaces a bona fide high-affinity colchicine-probe with a binding affinity of 5.1&#177;0.3 x10<sup>7<\/sup> M<sup>-1<\/sup> at 25&#778;C. Moreover, PM534 shows potent antineoplastic activity <i>in vitro<\/i>, with GI<sub>50<\/sub> values in the low nanomolar range, observed in different human tumor cancer cell lines. An <i>in vivo<\/i> Proof of the Concept (PoC) was performed in athymic <i>nu\/nu<\/i> mice bearing H460 (NSCLC) tumors that were treated (intravenous, on days 0, 7, 14) with different doses (ranging from 0.75 mg\/kg to 2.5 mg\/kg) of PM534. Results demonstrated strong, dose-related PM534-induced antitumor activity in this <i>in vivo<\/i> model.<br \/>Conclusions: The mechanism of action of PM534 involves an optimized interaction with the colchicine site, which is reflected in its high affinity for the substrate, being this the ultimate reason for the observed cellular activity. Additionally, PM534 presents a potent antitumor activity <i>in vitro<\/i> that was translated into a clear positive <i>in vivo<\/i> PoC that resulted in strong antitumor effect.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-10 Tubulin agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tubulin,Antitumor agents,,Novel anticancer agents,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maria Ángela Oliva<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Beatriz Álvarez-Bernad<sup>2<\/sup>, Daniel Lucena-Agell<sup>1<\/sup>, Marta Martínez Diez<sup>3<\/sup>, María José Guillén<sup>4<\/sup>, Gema Santamaría Nuñez<sup>3<\/sup>, María José Muñoz-Alonso<sup>3<\/sup>, Eva  M.

Such cancers become dependent on alternative DDR pathways to maintain genome integrity, making them selectively vulnerable to DDR inhibitors. The concept of synthetic lethality has been successfully applied to develop strategies to treat subsets of such tumors. Clinically, PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have been successful particularly in Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) cancers. Other agents have also been designed to target these DDR deficiencies in cancer cells and have potential to be clinically beneficial. LP-184 is a next generation acylfulvene prodrug metabolized to an active compound by prostaglandin reductase 1 (PTGR1) that is often elevated in multiple tumors. LP-184-induced DNA lesions are likely repaired by the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) and Homologous Repair (HR) pathways. Reduced activities of multiple DDR-related pathways in solid tumor models correlated with increased sensitivities to LP-184 as indicated by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Chinese Hamster Ovary cells with NER mutations (ERCC1\/2\/6) were at least 4 fold more sensitive to LP-184 relative to otherwise isogenic parental cells. ERCC2 or BRCA2 depletion enhanced LP-184 sensitivity 5-8X in a metastatic prostate cancer cell line. LP-184 showed ~120 fold higher potency (IC50 77 nM) compared to Olaparib in HRD prostate cancer organoid model LuCaP 96 (BRCA2\/ CHEK2 inactivating mutations). Across 14 patient-derived pancreatic, lung and prostate tumor models harboring HR mutations (BRCA1\/2, CHEK1\/2, ATM\/ATR, PALB2, PARP1\/2, RAD51, FANCA\/B), LP-184 showed ex vivo IC50s in the range of 30-300 nM, whereas Olaparib IC50s ranged from 1700-6900 nM. LP-184 treatment resulted in complete tumor regression (107-141% TGI) in 10\/10 HR deficient triple negative breast cancer PDX models of which 7\/10 were resistant Olaparib\/ Niraparib and to Doxorubicin\/ Cyclophosphamide. LP-184 treatment resulted in complete and durable tumor regression in HRD (BRCA1\/ATR mutant) pancreatic cancer PDX models (112-140% TGI). In the ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR3 having HRD\/NERD phenotype, LP-184 IC50 was 13 nM, Olaparib IC50 was 145 nM and their combination Bliss Synergy Score was 16 indicating synergy. LP-184 is synthetic lethal resulting from its abilities to cause unresolvable DNA damage if tumor cells express high PTGR1 and are deficient in NER\/HR genes. Unlike PARPi, LP-184 has striking activity in both NERD as well as HRD cancers. These strong data have prompted the development of a soon to be launched clinical trial to translate the broad preclinical anticancer activity of LP-184 in solid tumors with HR\/NER pathway defects, such as pancreatic, prostate, ovarian and breast cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-01 DNA-reactive agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Solid tumors,DNA damage,Homologous recombination,Repair,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Aditya Kulkarni<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jianli Zhou<sup><\/sup>, Neha Biyani<sup><\/sup>, Kishor Bhatia<sup><\/sup>, Panna Sharma<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Lantern Pharma Inc., Dallas, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"138df60b-6035-4135-8ff6-1acbc64d6dae","ControlNumber":"3552","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;A.

Transcriptional inhibitors of survivin have been tested in clinical trials. However, results have been disappointing. We thus investigated the small molecules LQZ-7I and S12 that inhibit dimerization of survivin protein and compared their growth-inhibiting efficacy with that of markedly decreased survivin expression in a novel transgenic NB mouse. Mice hemizygous for <i>BIRC5<\/i> were crossed with TH-MYCN mice to generate BIRC5<sup>+\/-<\/sup>\/MYCN<sup>tg\/+<\/sup> mice. NB incidence, growth and retransplantation capacity were assessed. In vitro, LQZ-7I and S12 were used to inhibit survivin protein interactions and the effects on proliferation and cell cycle of NB cells were investigated. <i>BIRC5 <\/i>hemizygous mice developed NB although mRNA and protein expression of survivin was markedly decreased. Surprisingly, incidence and latency of the NB that developed in the BIRC5<sup>+\/-<\/sup>\/MYCN<sup>tg\/+<\/sup> mice did not differ from the NB in the TH-MYCN mice, and tumor growth and survival of the mice was not affected. In stark contrast, the survivin interaction inhibitors LQZ-7I and S12 abolished anchorage-independent growth and proliferation of NB cell lines. Reduced growth of NB cells resulted from defects in mitosis induced by LQZ-7I or S12 or. LQZ-7I was the more efficient inhibitor of NB cells while S12 was not able to reduce tumor growth in a xenograft model. Taken together, these results support the notion that inhibiting survivin interaction is more efficacious in NB than inhibiting survivin transcription.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Survivin,Neuroblastoma,Small molecule inhibitor,Transgenic mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Carmen Dorneburg<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Celimene Galliger<sup>1<\/sup>, Voker Rasche<sup>2<\/sup>, Andre Lechel<sup>3<\/sup>, Thomas  F.

The development of novel anti-tubulin agents with more efficient mechanisms of action presents several challenges due to their poor solubility, troublesome synthesis or purification, and toxicities. In this work, we present the novel anti-tubulin agent PM534, a synthetic small molecule that shows efficient antitumoral and antiangiogenic properties <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Methods and Results: PM534 exhibits a potent antitumor activity <i>in vitro<\/i> with a mean GI<sub>50<\/sub> value in the low nanomolar range in several different human cancer cell lines. Washout <i>in vitro<\/i> experiments show irreversible cellular effects after 1h in contact with the compound, compelling the cells to apoptotic cell death likely due to PM534 induced disorganization of the tubulin cytoskeleton. PM534 inhibits migration and invasion of tumor cells <i>in vitro<\/i>, and arrests the cell cycle in the G2\/M phase, forcing them to apoptosis. In addition, PM534 presents potent antiangiogenic effects <i>in vitro<\/i>, robustly inhibiting endothelial cells proliferation and migration, and the formation of angiotubes. The <i>in vivo<\/i> antitumor activity of PM534 was characterized in human-derived tumors xenografted in athymic <i>nu\/nu<\/i> mice, namely breast (MDA-MB-231), and pancreas (Mia-Paca-2). PM534 was intravenously administered once per week for three consecutive weeks at 5.0 mg\/kg. <i>In vivo<\/i> PM534-induced antitumor activity (vs. placebo) was seen in MDA-MB-231 (T\/C, 0.3% on Day 28; TV, p&#60;0.0001) and Mia-Paca-2 (21.3% on Day 21; TV, p&#60;0.0001). Also, PM534 treatment increased with statistical significance (vs. placebo) the median survival time of mice bearing MDA-MB-231 (82 vs. 33 days; p&#60;0.0001) and Mia-Paca-2 (51 vs. 30 days; p=0.0008). Of note, complete tumor remissions were observed in 2\/10 (lasting 11 days and 161 days, each), and 10\/10 (lasting 45 days in 9\/10 and 140 days in 1\/10) PM534-treated animals bearing Mia-Paca-2 and MDA-MB-231 and tumors, respectively.<br \/>Conclusions: Based on <i>in vitro<\/i> activity against different human tumor cell lines, <i>in vivo<\/i> activity in xenografted human tumors, as well as on its anti-angiogenic properties, the safety, pharmacology and preliminary antitumor activity of PM534 will be evaluated in a first-in-human clinical trial to be conducted in patients with advanced solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-10 Tubulin agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antiangiogenic agents,Antitumor agents,Novel anticancer agents,Tubulin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Marta Martínez Diez<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, María José Muñoz-Alonso<sup>1<\/sup>, Gema Santamaría Nuñez<sup>1<\/sup>, María José Guillén<sup>2<\/sup>, María Ángela Oliva<sup>3<\/sup>, Eva Maria Garrido-Martin<sup>1<\/sup>, Pablo Avilés<sup>4<\/sup>, J.

Microtubule targeting agents (MTAs) are highly successful chemotherapeutic agents because they target MT dynamics and interfere with MT-dependent cellular processes. The clinical efficacy of MTAs is limited by multidrug resistance due to expression of the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) drug efflux pump or increased expression of <i>&#946;<\/i>III-tubulin. This necessitates the development of novel MTAs effective against cell lines expressing these forms of drug resistance, which could offer potential advantages in patients who fail to respond to current MTAs, such as paclitaxel. Previously, we reported colchicine site (CS) binding compound <b>1 <\/b>with<b> <\/b>a pyrido[3,2-<i>d<\/i>]pyrimidine scaffold and a 2-H substitution and <i>N<\/i>4-4&#8217;-methoxyaniline substitution inhibited colchicine binding and tubulin assembly (87% inhibition at 5 &#181;M and IC<sub>50<\/sub> = 1.3 &#181;M, respectively).

Compound <b>7<\/b> was found to be highly potent in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 2.5 nM which was ~3.5-fold better than combretastatin-A4 (CA4).

Thus, we have identified 2-CH<sub>3 <\/sub>substituted pyrido[3,2-<i>d<\/i>]pyrimidines as a novel structural scaffold for inhibition of tubulin assembly and colchicine binding that have potent cytotoxic activity against the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and against both the parental ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR-8 and its derivative Pgp overexpressing cell line NCI\/ADR-RES.

Thus, HDAC6 is a potential pharmacological target for cancer treatment. In humans, HDAC6 inhibition can be monitored by measuring the ratio between tubulin and histone acetylation. However, the identification of biomarkers to be used as a signature for patient stratification that correlates with the treatment efficacy is missing. Since we have previously demonstrated that the activity of the selective HDAC6 inhibitor ITF3756 on myeloid cells plays a role in the antitumor immune response in the TME, we reasoned that an ITF3756-specific signature could be identified in unstimulated monocytes treated with the compound. Monocytes were purified from healthy donors, treated with ITF3756 and RNAseq and proteomic analyses were performed. Gene Ontology analysis shows that ITF3756 has a widespread effect on monocyte transcriptome and proteome. We observed the down-modulation of genes and proteins involved in inflammatory pathways and in transcription regulation. Up-regulation of neutrophil-mediated immunity, metabolic pathways and protein phosphorylation was also identified. Focusing on genes that could be relevant in the tumor context, we selected a panel of genes from the most up- (SCL27A1, ANXA6 and IRF6) and down-modulated (CD84, RANK, CXCL2, CXCL3, STAB-1, CD163, PD-L1, CD206 and ADA). Interestingly, we found among the downmodulated genes markers of M2 macrophages, genes related to the tumor associated macrophages, and STAB-1, whose targeting is currently in clinical trials for cancer immunotherapy. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) could be a less expensive starting material for biomarker identification to be collected during a clinical trial when compared to purified monocytes. Thus, to ascertain whether the regulation by ITF3756 of our selected genes was detectable also in PBMCs we performed gene expression analysis after ITF3756 treatment and we confirmed that all selected genes were reproducibly modulated. Surface protein expression of M2 macrophages biomarkers in our panel, were determined by flow cytometry and all of them were significantly modulated in PBMCs. These data show how our approach successfully led both to the identification of a biomarker signature that could be used in clinical trials to monitor the pharmacodynamic effect of ITF3756, and to the discovery of previously unknown targets of HDAC6 inhibition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HDAC inhibitor,Biomarkers,Immuno-oncology,PD-L1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Chiara Ripamonti<sup><\/sup>, Valeria Spadotto<sup><\/sup>, Monica Forino<sup><\/sup>, <b>Christian Steinkuhler<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Gianluca Fossati<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Italfarmaco S.p.A., Cinisello Balsamo, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e9c56d26-d84d-4f07-8c57-0f064e3096da","ControlNumber":"4979","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;C.

MTAP loss, a key enzyme in the methionine and adenine salvage pathways, leads to the accumulation of its substrate MTA. MTA competes with the methyl donor SAM for binding to type II arginine methyltransferase PRMT5, placing PRMT5 in a hypomorphic state and vulnerable to further PRMT5 inhibition. MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors are an emerging class of therapeutics targeting MTAP null tumors. AMG 193, currently in Phase 1 trials, and its representative analog AM-9747 have broad spectrum activity in MTAP null tumor models across hematologic and solid tumor indications. Mechanistically, AM-9747 induces DNA damage, shown by increased phosphorylated H2AX, resulting in cell cycle arrest and senescence. Exploration of clinically relevant therapeutic combinations with standard of care (SOC) chemotherapies or targeted agents that could potentiate this DNA damage or target orthogonal pathways is a rational therapeutic approach. Here, we evaluated AM-9747 in combination with SOC chemotherapies and assessed synergy using the Chou-Talalay Method to generate Combination Index (CI) scores. SOC agents representing a variety of mechanisms of action (paclitaxel, carboplatin, gemcitabine, pemetrexed, irinotecan, 5-FU) were evaluated and results ranged from strongly synergistic (CI&#60;0.3) to additive (CI=1) in a panel of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer cell lines. The SOC combinations augmented AM-9747 induced DNA damage resulting in increased cell cycle arrest and nuclear count assays confirmed the synergistic antiproliferative effects of the combinations. Combinations of AM-9747 and one strongly synergistic agent (carboplatin) and one moderately synergistic agent (paclitaxel) were evaluated in H292 NSCLC xenografts. Significant reductions in tumor burden compared to single agent treatments were observed with AM-9747 + paclitaxel (67% TGI) and AM-9747 + carboplatin (82% TGI). Additionally, roughly 2-3% of NSCLC tumors harbor both <i>MTAP<\/i> loss and a KRAS G12C mutation. To target both pathways we combined the FDA-approved KRAS G12C inhibitor sotorasib with AM-9747 and observed synergy (CI&#60;0.6) in MIAPACA2 cells. Nuclear counts confirmed a greater cell growth inhibition in the combination and immunoblots confirmed on target inhibition of both pathways. Combination treatment of AM-9747 and sotorasib in LU99 NSCLC xenografts resulted in significant tumor regression compared to each single agent with 10\/10 mice tumor free. This combination is being tested in additional MTAP null KRAS G12C mutant models. Overall, our data suggests that combining MTA-cooperative inhibitor AM-9747 with SOC or clinically relevant targeted agents is a compelling therapeutic strategy for the treatment of <i>MTAP<\/i> null cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination studies,PRMT5,MTAP,sotorasib,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Katherine Slemmons<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Brian Belmontes<sup><\/sup>, Siyuan Liu<sup><\/sup>, Jodi Moriguchi<sup><\/sup>, Antonia Policheni<sup><\/sup>, Paul  E.

There are four molecular subtypes based on the high expression of distinct transcription factors and with different therapeutic vulnerabilities. However, all share transcriptional addiction as pathogenic mechanism. Lurbinectedin is a novel oncogenic transcription inhibitor, approved in the United States and other countries for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic SCLC with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to analyze the activity of lurbinectedin in the different SCLC molecular subtypes and to investigate new biomarkers of response.<br \/><u>Methods and Results<\/u> - We have characterized a panel of 20 SCLC human cell lines based on the expression of ASCL1, NEUROD1, YAP1 and POU2F3, where lurbinectedin yielded a mean IC<sub>50<\/sub> value of 6.52 nM, which is considerable greater than the activity exerted by topotecan, irinotecan, carboplatin, etoposide, olaparib, alisertib and navitoclax (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 100 &#181;M-100 nM). Lurbinectedin potency is high in the four molecular subtypes, with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 4.1, 14.9, 7.2, and 0.2 nM for SCLC-A, -N, -I and -P, respectively. However, high expression of POU2F3 correlated with better responses. In fact, mean IC<sub>50<\/sub> was 0.28 nM for POU2F3<sup>high <\/sup>cells versus 12.1 nM for all POU2F3<sup>low <\/sup>cells (p=0.0443). Additionally, basal SLFN11 levels were evaluated, observing that SLFN11<sup>high<\/sup> cells responded better to lurbinectedin, with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 1.1 nM versus 11.8 nM for SLFN11<sup>low<\/sup> (p=0.05). Likewise, lurbinectedin treatment induced greater antitumor activity in SLFN11<sup>high<\/sup> tumor-bearing mice (H526: T\/C, 18% on day 11) than in SLFN11<sup>low<\/sup> tumor-bearing mice (H82: T\/C, 65% on day 7) after intravenous treatment at 0.18 mg\/kg (on days 0, 7 and 14). Finally, SLFN11 expression was evaluated by IHC in FFPE tumor samples from SCLC patients participating in a multicenter phase II clinical trial in advanced solid tumors (NCT02454972), which allowed lurbinectedin accelerated approval in this indication by FDA. Patients with higher expression of SLFN11 had a slightly better overall survival (OS at 6 months: 68.4% (&#60;15%, N=20) vs. 98.7% (&#8805;15%, N=20) p=0.0261)), especially in the refractory\/resistant subgroup (OS at 6 months: 33.3% (&#60;15%, N=9) vs. 100.0% (&#8805;15%, N=6) p&#60;0.0001).<br \/><u>Conclusions<\/u> - Lurbinectedin is highly effective in all molecular subtypes of SCLC <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>, with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values at least two logs more potent than for other antitumoral agents and its activity is even greater in tumors with high POU2F3 expression and\/or high SLFN11 expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-01 DNA-reactive agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antitumor agents,Transcription,Transcriptional inhibitor,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Marta Martínez Diez<sup>1<\/sup>, Gema Santamaría Nuñez<sup>1<\/sup>, María José Guillén<sup>2<\/sup>, Daniel Rueda<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Eva Maria Garrido-Martin<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Pablo Avilés<sup>4<\/sup>, Carmen Cuevas<sup>5<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Cell Biology and Mechanism of Action, Pharma Mar, S.A., Madrid, Spain,<sup>2<\/sup>Pharmacology, Pharma Mar, S.A., Madrid, Spain,<sup>3<\/sup>Biomarkers and Translational Studies, Pharma Mar, S.A., Madrid, Spain,<sup>4<\/sup>Pharmacology and Toxicology, Pharma Mar, S.A., Madrid, Spain,<sup>5<\/sup>Research and Development, Pharma Mar, S.A., Madrid, Spain","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"13eacf4c-11b5-4adc-a562-747b4c4ea585","ControlNumber":"5891","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

These poor outcomes have motivated intensive searches for effective and safe targeted agents. Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD)-box protein DDX5 was found to be highly expressed in several solid cancers. DDX5, especially its phosphorylated form at Y593, has been reported to promote &#946;-catenin cytoplasm-to-nucleus shuttling and subsequently facilitate the transcriptional activities of the &#946;-catenin\/T-cell factor (TCF) complex leading to enhanced expression of genes that are critical for growth, including <i>MYC<\/i> and <i>CCND1<\/i>. Knockdown of <i>DDX5<\/i> has also been reported to reduce the growth of AML cells, indicating that DDX5 is a potential therapeutic target in AML. However, it remains unknown whether the growth dependence of AML on DDX5 is mainly mediated by &#946;-catenin signaling. Importantly, drugs that selectively target DDX5 have not been tested in AML. In this study, we first analyzed the TCGA AML dataset and found that <i>DDX5<\/i> gene is significantly overexpressed in the AML cohort compared to normal bone marrow samples. High <i>DDX5<\/i> expression is associated with worse overall survival in AML patients. Moreover, <i>DDX5<\/i> correlates with <i>CTNNB1 <\/i>which encodes &#946;-catenin, at transcript levels. We further found that DDX5 is constitutively phosphorylated at Y593 and predominantly present in the nucleus of 10 AML cell lines tested. These results indicate the clinical relevance of DDX5 whose functional impact may link to &#946;-catenin signaling in AML. We then determined the therapeutic efficacy of targeting DDX5 in human AML using RX-5902, a quinoxalinyl-piperazine compound. RX-5902 was previously shown to interfere with the interaction between phosphorylated DDX5 and &#946;-catenin, inhibiting &#946;-catenin signaling in some solid tumors. We found that RX-5902 attenuated phosphorylation of DDX5 at Y593, led to accumulation of &#946;-catenin in the cytoplasm and consequently downregulated c-MYC in human AML cells within 24 hours. Treatment with RX-5902 dramatically increased cellular ROS level, induced cleaved-caspase3 mediated apoptosis and eventually inhibited cell growth of most human AML cell lines and primary AML cells in culture. These results mirrored what we observed following DDX5 depletion by shRNAs in AML cell lines. Also, dosing of RX-5902 <i>in vivo<\/i> significantly suppressed the growth of AML xenotransplants in immunocompromised mice and prolonged survival. Finally, we performed dynamic BH3 profiling and showed that RX-5902 increased apoptotic priming and BCL-2 dependence in AML cells. Therefore, we reasoned that simultaneous targeting DDX5 and BCL-2 may improve the therapeutic efficacy in AML. Indeed, concurrent treatment using RX-5902 and Venetoclax, a BCL-2 inhibitor, synergistically induced apoptosis in AML cells. Collectively, therapeutic targeting of DDX5 may be a novel and effective approach in AML and warrants further study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,DDX5,Apoptosis,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>WEI NI<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Swati Garg<sup>1<\/sup>, Fen Zhu<sup>1<\/sup>, Ellen  L.

In this work, we aimed to discover a rational biomarker-based approach to select the right candidate patients for this treatment. We assessed the efficacy of nab-paclitaxel in 27 patient-derived xenografts (PDX), including 14 Ewing sarcomas, five rhabdomyosarcomas and several other pediatric solid tumors. Response rate (partial or complete response) was remarkable in rhabdomyosarcomas (four of five) and Ewing sarcomas (four of 14). We addressed several predictive factors of response to nab-paclitaxel such as the expression of the secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), chromosomal stability of cancer cells and expression of antiapoptotic members of the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family of proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-W and Mcl-1. Protein (immunoblotting) and gene expression of SPARC correlated positively, while immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry expression of Bcl-2 correlated negatively with the efficacy of nab-paclitaxel in Ewing sarcoma PDX. The negative correlation of Bcl-2 immunoblotting signal and activity was especially robust (r = 0.8352; <i>P<\/i> = 0.0007; Pearson correlation). Consequently, we evaluated pharmacological strategies to inhibit Bcl-2 during nab-paclitaxel treatment. We observed that the Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax improved the activity of nab-paclitaxel in highly resistant Bcl-2-expressing Ewing sarcoma PDX. Overall, our results suggest that low Bcl-2 expression could be used to select patients with Ewing sarcoma sensitive to nab-paclitaxel, and Bcl-2 inhibitors could improve the activity of this drug in Bcl-2-expressing Ewing sarcoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-10 Tubulin agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ewing sarcoma,Rhabdomyosarcoma,Bcl-2 protein family,Taxanes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Guillem Pascual-Pasto<sup><\/sup>, Claudia Resa-Pares<sup><\/sup>, <b>Angel  M.

GSK3&#946; is a multifaceted kinase and is a key regulator of a number of cellular processes. It is known to function as a positive regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Usually, cells that undergo EMT are known to acquire stem cell properties and these cells have properties that are known to be resistant to chemotherapies. Inhibition of GSK3&#946; has been shown to decrease markers of EMT and reduce cancer stem cells. High levels of GSK3&#946; were found in the basal-2 subtype of triple negative breast cancer cells, HCC1806. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are expressed at high levels in some cancers, including TNBC. In this study, vorinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, was shown to down regulate GSK3 expression in HCC1806 cells at both the gene and protein level using qPCR and western blots. Furthermore, cancer stem cells (CSC) cell markers CD44\/CD24 using flow cytometry and immunostaining were significantly decreased. Previous studies published from our laboratory have shown vorinostat&#8217;s ability to decrease TNBC cells invasion compacity, as well as cell growth. This study suggests that targeting GSK3&#946; may be a potential therapeutic target for certain subtypes of TNBC. Triple negative breast cancer remains one of the most aggressive breast cancers, often having a high mortality rate in younger women.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Histone deacetylase inhibitor,Cancer stem cells,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Beverly D.

Current treatment for Ewing sarcoma includes a combination of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents and local control with radiation and\/or surgery. The purpose of this study is to identify currently available targeted agents which may be combined with chemotherapy for use in Ewing sarcoma to improve patient outcomes.<br \/>Methods: Novel targeted approaches for the treatment of ES were identified using RNA sequencing performed on ES patient tumors with bioinformatic analysis of gene expression. HDAC inhibitors were tested on patient cell lines at escalating doses and cell viability was assessed with CellTiter-Glo 2.0 and analyzed with GraphPad Prism to determine the IC50. Cells were treated with Panobinostat for 12 and 24 hours and RNA sequencing was performed. Cell cycle analysis was performed using Incucyte&#174; Cell Cycle Lentivirus Reagent and analyzed using an Incucyte&#174; S3. At 24- and 48-hours western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the effect on cell cycle and apoptosis. Combination studies with standard chemotherapy were performed and viability was assessed with CellTiter-Glo 2.0. At 24 hours of treatment with a combination of doxorubicin and HDAC inhibition western blot analysis was performed to evaluate changes in DNA damage and repair.<br \/>Results: RNA analysis identified HDAC2 as a potential therapeutic target. The pan-HDAC inhibitors, Panobinostat and Belinostat, and the HDAC1\/2 inhibitor, Romidepsin, were cytotoxic to all Ewing sarcoma cell lines tested with clinically relevant IC50s. Mechanistically, pathways involved in cell cycle progression and DNA repair were repressed by Panobinostat as shown by RNA sequencing and western blotting (Cyclin D1, pRb, CHK1). Additionally, cell cycle analysis has shown a G1 arrest in response to HDAC inhibition. HDAC inhibitors significantly decrease cell viability when combined with standard chemotherapy (upfront and relapse therapy) compared to that of chemotherapy alone. When combined with doxorubicin, CHK1 and CHK2 were significantly decreased and pH2AX was significantly increased indicating an accumulation of DNA damage.<br \/>Conclusion: This work highlights that combining HDAC inhibitors with standard of care chemotherapy may be an effective treatment and improve outcomes for Ewing sarcoma patients. Future studies of HDAC inhibitors combined with chemotherapy drugs will aim to determine efficacy in xenograft models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ewing sarcoma,HDAC inhibitor,DNA damage response,Cell cycle,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kaitlyn H.

Though treatment options for newly diagnosed patients have evolved in recent years, they are not curative, and relapse is common with 2,500-3,000 relapsed or refractory (R\/R) MM US patients seeking novel treatments, annually. Cereblon (CRBN)-binding Ikaros and Aiolos (I\/A) protein degraders (i.e., lenalidomide (LEN) and pomalidomide (POM)) have had great success in treating MM. However, due to the unstable chiral nature of the CRBN-binding moiety, common to these molecules, many exist as racemic mixtures (1:1 mixture of interconverting (<i>R<\/i>)- and (<i>S<\/i>)-enantiomers). A growing body of evidence suggests that the (<i>S<\/i>)- enantiomer is the active anticancer species, while the (<i>R<\/i>)-enantiomer is inactive and potentially results in undesired activity. The ability to stabilize the active (<i>S<\/i>)- enantiomer represents a potential strategy to improve therapeutic outcomes.<br \/>We are developing SP-3164, the deuterium-stabilized (<i>S<\/i>)-enantiomer of avadomide (AVA), an I\/A-degrading molecular glue which has been studied in over 400 patients, demonstrating safety and activity in hematologic diseases. Our <i>in vitro<\/i> data demonstrate that SP-3164 more potently and rapidly degrades the cancer-promoting transcription factors, I\/A, compared to LEN, POM, and AVA, while the stabilized (<i>R<\/i>)-enantiomer, SP-3165, neither binds CRBN nor degrades I\/A. In preliminary <i>in vivo<\/i> studies, SP-3164 elicited significant tumor growth inhibition (TGI). Here, we investigate the activity of SP-3164 in MM, compared to established treatment regimens.<br \/>SP-3164&#8217;s potential to degrade Aiolos in MM.1S cells was compared to SP-3165, AVA, and POM. SP-3164 rapidly and robustly degraded Aiolos in a time- and dose-dependent manner, more potently than AVA and POM, while SP-3165 demonstrated minimal Aiolos degradation. To investigate the effect of SP-3164 on cell survival, we treated NCI-H929 cells with SP-3164 (0.1 &#181;M, 1 &#181;M, and 10 &#181;M) and SP-3165 (1 &#181;M) and assessed apoptosis by flow cytometry. SP-3164 induced dose-dependent early and late apoptosis after 72 hours, while SP-3165 showed no induction of apoptosis. SP-3164&#8217;s <i>in vivo<\/i> activity was assessed and compared to SP-3165, LEN, and POM in an NCI-H929 mouse xenograft model. SP-3164 showed significant TGI as a single agent while SP-3165 seemed to support tumor growth. LEN and POM demonstrated minimal TGI. When combined with dexamethasone (DEX), SP-3164 had improved TGI compared to the combination of POM+DEX.<br \/>These preclinical data demonstrate that SP-3164 is a potent CRBN-binding molecular glue with the ability to rapidly degrade cancer-promoting transcription factors and induce apoptosis <i>in vitro<\/i>. <i>In vivo<\/i>, SP-3164 has superior single agent and combination activity compared to approved molecular glues. These data support the continued development as a novel therapy in MM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Small molecule drug,Targeted Protein Degradation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Aundrietta D.

It also regulates the activity of MAPK and PI3K signaling through methylation and activation of various receptor tyrosine kinases. As such, it has epigenetic effects that may be therapeutic in oncology. Successful clinical development of PRMT5 inhibitors will depend on upon utilizing this unique inhibitor modality and identifying those cancers with sensitivity to PRMT5 inhibition. By evaluating the potency and efficacy of several SAM-competitive, substrate-competitive, and MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors using a large (n&#62;500), diverse panel of human cancer cell lines, we determined that the SAM-competitive inhibitor modality offers the best therapeutic potential thanks to its larger therapeutic window <i>in vitro<\/i>. This screening approach also identified several solid tumor histologies that were extremely sensitive to PRMT5 inhibition. Using our proprietary chemistry and by screening through the panel of human cancer cell lines, we identified UCT-000445, a SAM-competitive PRMT5 inhibitor with high selectivity over PRMT9 and good pharmacokinetic properties. Moreover, efficacy UCT-000445 is achieved regardless of <i>MTAP<\/i> gene status in histologies outside of hematological malignancies and including colon. UCT-000445 potently inhibits tumor growth in multiple human xenograft models of cancers, including but not limited to colon and lung cancers. The responses observed are durable upon cessation of treatment. Marked combined efficacy was also observed with standard of care treatment in these cancer types. UCT-000445 was well tolerated in vivo and using a CD-1 nude mouse model we found that while reticulocyte proliferation (a surrogate marker for bone marrow cytopenias) is abrogated by continuous treatment with UCT-000445, the use of intermittent dosing schedules overcomes this effect, while yielding equivalent efficacy. Our data with UCT-000445 indicate that SAM-competitive PRMT5 inhibitors may represent a novel and compelling therapeutic strategy for the treatment of multiple solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Drug Discovery,Targeted therapy,PRMT5,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Martina S.

The flexible Cu(I\/II) redox behavior facilitates the formation of copper complexes that are more potent and less toxic. The anticancer activity of several agents can be enhanced by forming copper complexes. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti-proliferative effects of two copper (II) complexes, copper-tolfenamic acid (Cu-TA) and copper thiosemicarbazone (Cu-acetylethTSC or CuTSC) against medulloblastoma (MB). MB is a cancer of the cerebellum which is associated with frequent relapse and drug resistance with the current treatments. It necessitates the development of alternative strategies. The anti-cancer activity of Cu-TA was evaluated in laboratory testing in some cancer models, but it has not been studied in MB. CuTSC against colorectal cancer, leukemia and breast cancer has been studied but it has not in MB.<br \/>Methods: TA and TSC were complexed with Cu and Cu-TA and CuTSC complexes were characterized through colorimetric\/mass spectrometric analyses. Cancer cells and cardiomyocytes were cultured using standard protocols and cell viability was measured using Cell Titer-Glo kit (Promega). Protein expression was determined by Western blot analysis.<br \/>Experiments\/Results: CuTA and CuTSC complexes showed proper characterization and stability during the testing period. Cardiomyocytes (H9C2) and human cancer cell lines representing breast, Ewing sarcoma and MB were screened for anti-proliferative activity of these two Cu complexes. While, cell viability was inhibited in all cancer cell lines, MB cell lines (DAOY and D283) showed higher efficacy while H9C2 cell viability was not affected. To understand the underlying mechanism of action, the effect of Cu-TA was assessed on the expression of c-PARP, Specificity protein 1 (Sp1) and an antiapoptotic protein, survivin. Western blot results revealed a clear decrease in the expression of both Sp1 and survivin and upregulation of c-PARP.<br \/>Discussion\/Conclusion: Both Cu-TA and CuTSC treatments result in a dose-time dependent anti-proliferative activity against cancer cells but not affecting non-malignant cardiomyocyte cells. Cu-TA can inhibit Sp1 and survivin and increase PARP cleavage suggesting the effect on Sp1-regulated oncogenes and an induction of apoptotic pathways. The studies to establish crossing of Blood Brain Barrier and further understand the underling mechanisms of these two Cu complexes in single and combination treatment alongside chemotherapeutic agents are currently under investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Medulloblastoma,Copper (II) complexes,Copper- Tolfenamic acid,Copper - Thiosemicarbazones,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hope Korshie Fiadjoe<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Christoffer Lambring<sup>1<\/sup>, Umesh  T.

Dysregulation and\/or overexpression of MYC are widely implicated in NSCLC, which suggests that MYC may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of NSCLC. Recently, two direct MYC inhibiting agents with improved <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy and tolerability, MYCi975 and Omomyc, have been developed. To define new drug strategies that could potentiate the therapeutic effects of MYC inhibitors, transcriptome datasets from MYCi975 and Omomyc studies were reanalyzed. These data revealed the induction of two class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs), HDAC5 and HDAC9, upon MYC inhibition. Importantly, class IIa HDACs are involved in cancer proliferation, aggressiveness, and prognosis. In addition, novel agents that selectively inhibit class IIa HDACs have demonstrated promising anti-tumor efficacy; thus, suggesting potential therapeutic benefits from dual targeting of MYC and class IIa HDACs. We assessed the treatment efficacy of MYCi plus class IIa HDACi across 18 NSCLC cell lines, 10 of which demonstrated substantial reduction of cell viability upon combination treatment. Querying of driver mutation spectra associated with differential drug response in our cell line panel defined that EGFR mutant cell lines exhibited resistance, while STK11 or Ras mutant cell lines were sensitive to our drug paradigm. Gene set enrichment analysis comparing the transcriptomes of sensitive versus resistant cell lines revealed that MYC Targets, Oxidative Phosphorylation, and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) pathways were activated in combination treatment responsive cell lines. RNA sequencing on treated cell lines identified large-scale transcriptional shifts facilitated by combination treatment, including suppression of MYC, cell cycle, and mitochondrial pathways. Furthermore, G1\/S arrest and elevated mitochondrial ROS levels in combination drug-treated cells were confirmed using flow cytometry. Concordant with the role of MYC as a key cell cycle regulator, MYC protein levels were decreased in the combination treatment group as compared to the vehicle or mono-treatment groups. Importantly, both MYC overexpression and ROS scavenger treatment partially rescued the reduction of cell viability by combination treatment, suggesting both MYC depletion and ROS elevation as contributors to therapeutic efficacy driven by combination treatment. Expanding these studies to <i>in vivo<\/i> models, we discern that combination MYC and class IIa HDAC inhibition significantly reduced tumor burden in a patient-derived xenograft model of human NSCLC. In summary, we define here a novel drug paradigm combining MYC and class IIa HDAC inhibitors, which potentiates anti-tumor efficacy in NSCLC via MYC depletion and oxidative stress.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myc,HDAC inhibitor,NSCLC,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jina Park<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Ying-Yu Chen<sup><\/sup>, Jennie Cao<sup><\/sup>, Michelle Vaz<sup><\/sup>, Ray-Whay C.

However, the clinical success of these therapies is dampened by the fact that the majority of patients demonstrate either inherent resistance to treatment or develop secondary resistance following an initial response. One key mechanism of tumor-driven ICI resistance is the generation and recruitment of suppressive immune cell types, including regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which coordinate to suppress anti-tumor T cell responses. Thus, there is a critical need for the development of novel combination strategies aimed at mitigating the presence and function of suppressive immune cells to improve the efficacy of ICIs in the clinic. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that histone deacetylase inhibition (HDACi) is associated with a decrease in both the number and function of tumor-infiltrating Tregs and MDSCs in the RENCA tumor model. Thus, the overall goal of these studies both preclinically and clinically is to investigate the impact of the immunomodulatory effects of HDACi in combination with ICI therapy, with the overall hypothesis that HDACi will improve the efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy in RCC<i>.<\/i> Our pre-clinical data support this hypothesis by demonstrating increased tumor control and survival in RENCA tumor-bearing mice when treated with a combination of anti-PD1 and HDACi compared to single agent therapy. These increases were also associated with an increase in the activation state of anti-tumor immune cells, as demonstrated by increased surface expression of MHC Class II molecules on macrophages and a decrease in phenotypically defined monocytic MDSCs. ATACseq and RNAseq data generated from combination-treated animals also outline a gene expression signature associated with both myeloid and T cell activation. Interestingly, our clinical studies also afforded us the opportunity to investigate potential biomarkers associated with responder status, which will allow us to better predict patient outcomes and administer therapies accordingly. Accumulating evidence from two independent clinical trials run by our group suggests that high levels of suppressive CD11b<sup>+<\/sup>HLA-DR<sup>lo<\/sup> MDSCs at baseline in the peripheral blood is associated with lack of clinical response to the combination of HDACi and ICI. Overall, these data support the rationale for the combination of ICI and HDACi in the clinic, and provide a potentially useful biomarker through which we can predict the success of combination therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-03 HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Histone deacetylase inhibitor,Immunomodulation,Kidney cancer,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sean Colligan<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Li Shen<sup><\/sup>, Christopher Rupert<sup><\/sup>, Jonathan Bard<sup><\/sup>, Roberto Pili<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9dced561-ced6-4adf-9a45-90bf76aea2d1","ControlNumber":"7701","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

We undertook a series of <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> studies to evaluate clinically staged KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitors in an effort to elucidate pharmacological factors underlying these clinical differences and identified potency, permeability\/efflux, and clearance as impediments to efficacy, particularly in the context of brain metastases. Adagrasib is reportedly efficacious in patients with brain metastases. Our preclinical experimentation suggests that distinguished potency and pharmacokinetics are critical to therapeutic benefit, particularly in the context of brain metastases. Using both structure- and ligand-based design approaches, we identified a development candidate UCT-001024, which is a covalent KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor that demonstrates superior target-engagement kinetics and cellular potency <i>in vitro<\/i>. UCT-001024 also demonstrates improved plasma and whole brain unbound clearance, and <i>in vivo<\/i> potency in ectopic xenograft models and a brain-tropic NSCLC metastasis model relative to adagrasib.

Cholesterol metabolism is a critical regulator of CSCs. Lipid Rafts are cholesterol-rich microdomains in the plasma membrane (PM) that anchor various growth receptors tyrosine kinases (RTKs). STARD5 is a novel protein that helps transport cholesterol from the endoplasmic reticulum to the PM. We have identified specific small molecule inhibitors of the STARD5 which disrupt the lipid rafts, resulting in the inhibition of growth signaling pathways.<br \/><b>Methods and Results: <\/b>In-silico modeling studies using STARD5 crystal structure revealed 8 putative inhibitors (SD5i (A-H)). In vitro binding studies to determine secondary structural changes using circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed SD5iA and SD5iB as excellent STARD5 ligands. Both SD5iA and SD5iB caused a potent inhibition (IC<sub>50 <\/sub>0.3 -18 &#181;M) of CSC-enriched 3D spheroids in 9 CRC cell lines representative of 3 consensus molecular subtypes. However, SD5iA but not SD5iB showed toxicity towards normal murine intestinal organoids at effective doses against CRC CSCs. Also, SD5iB enhanced cytotoxicity by oxaliplatin and panitumumab against CRC CSCs in HT-29 spheroids. Hence, SD5iB was advanced into in vivo studies. SD5iB caused no discernible toxicity in doses as high as 100 mg\/kg in NCr nude mice at gross, serum chemistry, organ viability, or intestinal stem cell level (organoid formation). Subsequently, we generated s.c. xenograft using dual CSC marker sorted HT-29 cells and enriched them further with chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin weekly x 3) treatment followed by randomization to vehicle or SD5iB (100mg\/kg i.p. 3\/wk x 3 wks.). We observed xenograft growth inhibition and LGR5 expression in SD5iB-treated animals compared to vehicle controls. Mechanistically, we observed a decrease in free accessible PM cholesterol by SD5i measured by fluorescently tagged cholesterol-binding bacterial protein fALOD4 in HT-29 cells. Moreover, lipid raft staining (cholera toxin B staining) was significantly reduced in SD5iB-treated HT-29 cells compared to vehicle control using immunofluorescence. Further, lipid raft isolation was done by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation to study the changes in the phosphorylation of RTKs SD5iB treatment in HT-29 spheroids resulted in decreased phosphorylation of EGFR, IGF1R&#946;, and FGFR1 in isolated lipid rafts. Consequently, we observed a robust inhibition of ERK1\/2 activation following SD5iB treatment compared to vehicle control.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: SD5i shows anti-CSC activity by targeting lipid-raft-driven growth factor signaling. Hence, STARD5 inhibitors represent a novel class of targeted therapy that will enhance the efficacy of FDA-approved therapies in CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-12 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer initiating cells,Cholesterol,Growth factor,Colorectal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shoja Hajira<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Chetna Sharon<sup><\/sup>, Daniel RodriguezAgudo<sup><\/sup>, Rio Boothelllo<sup><\/sup>, Glenn Kellogg<sup><\/sup>, Gregorio Gil<sup><\/sup>, William Pandak<sup><\/sup>, Bhaumik B.
