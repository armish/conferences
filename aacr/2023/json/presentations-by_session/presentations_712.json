[{"Abstract":"<i>nab<\/i>-Sirolimus is an mTOR inhibitor (mTORi) approved in the US for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic malignant perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa) based on clinical efficacy and safety data from the phase 2, multicenter, open-label AMPECT trial (NCT02494570). <i>TSC1<\/i> and <i>TSC2<\/i> are tumor suppressor genes and key upstream regulators of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1); inactivating alterations (loss-of-function mutations or deletions) in these genes lead to mTORC1 hyperactivation, which may contribute to tumor formation. Phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein (pS6) is a reliable surrogate for mTORC1 activity. Here we present the results of an exploratory biomarker analysis performed on samples from patients enrolled in the AMPECT study. Targeted exome next-generation sequencing (NGS) using a 500-gene OncoPanel test (Center for Advanced Molecular Diagnostics, Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital, Boston, MA) assessed mutations, copy number changes, and translocation events. pS6 was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Twenty-five patients had tissue sufficient for NGS, 56% (14\/25) had either <i>TSC1<\/i> (N=5, 20%) or <i>TSC2<\/i> (N=9, 36%) mutations: <i>TSC1<\/i>, 1 frameshift, 2 splice site, 1 missense, and 1 nonsense mutation; <i>TSC2<\/i>, 1 nonsense, 7 frameshift, and 1 homozygous deletion. In this dataset, <i>TSC1<\/i> and <i>TSC2<\/i> inactivating alterations were mutually exclusive. Patients with <i>TSC1 <\/i>or<i> TSC2<\/i> inactivating alterations achieved a clinically meaningful benefit: 64.3% (9\/14) objective overall responses (including complete and partial responses) and median (95% CI) duration of response (DOR) of 45.7 (5.6, not reached [NR]) months, progression-free survival (PFS) of 41.2 (5.5, NR) months, and overall survival (OS) of NR (31.6, NR) months. Mutations in <i>TP53<\/i>,<i> RB1<\/i>, and<i> ATRX <\/i>were also common (48%, 24%, and 20%, respectively).<br \/>Of tissue samples evaluable for IHC (N=25), responses occurred in 58.8% (10 of 17) of patients with pS6 positive tumors versus 0% (0 of 8) with pS6 negative tumors; absent pS6 staining was negatively associated with response to <i>nab<\/i>-sirolimus (<i>P<\/i>=0.008, Fisher&#8217;s exact). Median DOR for pS6 positive responders was 39.7 (5.6, NR) months. In pS6 positive vs pS6 negative patients, the median PFS was 24.4 (2.8, 53.1) vs 5.5 (2.8, NR) months, and OS was 53.1 (18.0, NR) vs 37.0 (16.6, NR) months. A variety of pathogenic inactivating alterations were observed in <i>TSC1 <\/i>and <i>TSC2 <\/i>genes, though <i>TSC2 <\/i>mutations were most commonly frameshift mutations; no recurring mutations were observed. A tumor-agnostic study (PRECISION 1: NCT05103358) is now recruiting patients with pathogenic inactivating <i>TSC1<\/i> or <i>TSC2<\/i> alterations to further examine these biomarker findings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,mTOR,TSC,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Lee D.

This is a retrospective analysis of association between longitudinal ctDNA levels and clinical outcomes in 1L TIS (anti-PD-1) + chemo-treated patients (pts) with nonsquamous or squamous NSCLC from RATIONALE-304 (NCT03663205) and 307 (NCT03594747), respectively.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Blood samples were collected at baseline (BL), first response (FR, complete or partial response assessed by investigators), and progressive disease (PD). ctDNA level was tested by OncoScreen Plus520 (Burning Rock) and the variant allele fraction categorized as undetectable (UD)\/detectable (D). Paired ctDNA analysis of BL and post-BL (FR or PD) values was by Wilcoxon sign-rank test. Median PFS and OS was calculated by Kaplan-Meier methodology. PD-L1 expression stratified Cox model was used to evaluate the effect of ctDNA on PFS and OS for BL and FR (adjusted with BL ctDNA) in each study. Impact of other BL characteristics was also assessed.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Of 217 pts treated with TIS + chemo in RATIONALE-304, 76 (35%) at BL, 40 (18%) at FR, and 30 (14%) at PD had ctDNA results. Of 238 pts treated with TIS + chemo in RATIONALE-307, 80 (34%) at BL, 65 (27%) at FR, and 33 (14%) at PD had ctDNA results. Paired ctDNA analysis showed significantly decreased ctDNA levels from BL to FR (P&#60;0.0001 in 304 and 307); no obvious change was detected from BL to PD in both studies. Pts with UD ctDNA status at FR had notably longer median PFS and OS compared with pts with D ctDNA; no such association was observed using BL ctDNA status in either study (<b>Table<\/b>).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> FR ctDNA level is decreased from BL, and seems to correlate with clinical outcomes of 1L TIS in combination with chemotherapy in NSCLC; ctDNA has potential to be a surrogate biomarker for efficacy.

The use of IMD is seamlessly integrated in standard surgical practice during tumor resection. None of the six enrolled patients experienced adverse events related to the IMD, and the retrieved tissue was usable for downstream analysis for 11 out of 12 retrieved specimens. Molecular analysis of the specimens provided, for the first time in humans, preliminary evidence of the robustness of the readout, with strong correlation between IMD analysis and clinic-radiological responses to temozolomide. We also identified novel transcriptomic and metabolomic biomarkers of response and resistance to a range of targeted and cytotoxic agents used on the IMD. From an investigational aspect, the amount of information obtained with IMD allows unprecedented characterization of tissue effects of any drugs of interest, within the physiological context of the intact tumor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microenvironment,Predictive biomarkers,Precision medicine,Glioblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Oliver Jonas<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pier Paolo Peruzzi<\/i><\/presenter>.

A key challenge is that RNA-seq does not perform well in FFPE tissue blocks due to RNA degradation and\/or RNA panel design, and cannot detect breakpoints outside of the gene body, which are established clinical biomarkers with mechanistic significance and clinical utility in solid hematological cancers. We developed a novel DNA-based partner-agnostic approach for identifying fusions from FFPE tumors using 3D genomics based on Arima-HiC technology and NGS. We profiled 184 FFPE tumors across various tumor types. This cohort includes 33 tumors with known gene fusions detected by RNA panels for clinical concordance analysis. It also includes 151 FFPE tumors, including 62 CNS tumors, 59 gynecological sarcomas, and 22 solid heme tumors, with no detectable genetic drivers from prior DNA and RNA panel CLIA assays. For clinical concordance, Arima-HiC technology detected 33\/33 fusions previously detected by RNA panels. For clinical validation and utility studies in our driver-negative cohort, Arima-HiC detected 1 or more fusions in 72% (109\/151) of tumors. To attribute clinical significance, we compared the genes implicated in our fusion calls with NCCN and WHO guidelines, and OncoKB, and assigned which tumors had an FDA-approved therapeutic level biomarker (&#8220;Tier 1&#8221;), a biomarker targeted in an ongoing clinical trial (&#8220;Tier 2&#8221;), or a diagnostic\/prognostic biomarker (&#8220;Tier 3&#8221;). Arima-HiC analysis found 33.8% (51\/151) of tumors had Tier 1 biomarkers, 4.0% (6\/151) had Tier 2 biomarkers, and a further 14.6% (22\/151) had Tier 3 biomarkers, indicating an overall yield of clinically actionable biomarkers at 52.3%. Several cases with Tier 1-3 fusions underwent confirmatory immunohistochemistry testing for oncoprotein expression, and 91.6% (11\/12) showed diffuse or focally positive staining. To highlight examples from prospectively analyzed cases from this cohort, we identified a novel <i>PD-L1 <\/i>rearrangement in a pediatric glioma tumor that was not detected by DNA or RNA panels, which we confirmed by PD-L1 IHC, and the patient was administered pembrolizumab after tumor recurrence and has since exhibited stable disease. We also identified a <i>MYBL1 <\/i>fusion in a glioma that spared the patient unnecessary chemotherapy post-resection. Our findings provide evidence of clinical concordance, validation, and utility, and underscore the need for 3D genome profiling to increase diagnostic yield by finding clinically actionable fusions in FFPE solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-02 Diagnostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene fusion,FFPE,Biomarkers,Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Anthony Schmitt<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristin Sikkink<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristyn Galbraith<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Misha Movahed-Ezazi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>George Jour<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matija Snuderl<\/i><\/presenter>.

The ability to detect MRD following curative treatment allows for the stratification of patients with higher risk of disease recurrence. Multiple studies, across hundreds of patients in different indications, including lung and colon cancer, have shown that tumor-informed personalized assays have high sensitivity to detect recurrence. The tumor-informed bespoke panels utilize sequencing of the tumor tissue to identify clonal somatic variants, which are then used to generate a personalized panel to track the variants in patient plasma. Next-generation MRD technologies are aiming to provide greater sensitivity by expanding methods beyond the small, personalized panels. Utilization of increased numbers of somatic variants is predicted to achieve a greater level of sensitivity for detection of MRD.<br \/>Here we describe, C2I Genomics which provides a novel platform that exploits whole genome sequencing of the tumor tissue and plasma to define a somatic variant signature. An important difference of this method is that it develops a personalized bioinformatic signature rather than a personalized NGS panel. To understand the potential of this novel methodology, we utilized a set of 54 contrived clinical sample dilutions from three indications, with an expected (or engineered) VAF range of 0.2-0.002%, that have commutability to the intended use population.<br \/>We found that C2I Genomics technology is highly sensitive, where for all returned samples, the assay routinely achieved detection down to the lowest dilution of 0.002% allelic frequency. Overall, the assay resulted in an average detection rate of 93% across all dilutions (n = 54). The aggregate detection rate of several tumor-informed assays, examining the same dilutions, yielded a detection rate of 68%.<br \/>In summary, the C2I Genomics assay showed robust detection from contrived samples which are representative of clinical trial samples in both cfDNA yields and allele frequency.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer diagnostics,Cancer detection,Bioinformatics,ctDNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Paul Labrousse<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Stetson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>James Hadfield<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chris Abbosh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ahmet Zehir<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carl Barrett<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian Dougherty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Darren Hodgson<\/i><\/presenter>.

The ongoing Ph2 SAVANNAH (NCT03778229) study is investigating this combination in pts with EGFRm NSCLC who have MET overexpression and\/or amplification upon progressive disease (PD) post-osimertinib. Using plasma EGFRm as an estimate of tumor burden, we report exploratory analyses of progression-free survival (PFS) by plasma EGFRm clearance during treatment at Day (D) 22. Additionally, agreement between tissue (IHC\/FISH) and plasma (NGS) testing for detecting MET overexpression and\/or amplification is reported. Following central MET testing on tumor tissue collected upon PD post-osimertinib, eligible pts received oral savolitinib (300 or 600 mg QD, or 300 mg BID) + oral osimertinib 80 mg QD. MET overexpression was assessed by IHC (3+ staining in &#8805;50% of tumor cells [IHC50+]) and amplification by FISH (MET copy number &#8805;5 and\/or MET:CEP7 ratio &#8805;2 [FISH5+]). Here, PFS analysis was performed in subgroups identified by exploratory higher biomarker cut-off levels of 3+ staining in &#8805;90% tumor cells (IHC90+) and\/or MET copy number &#8805;10 (FISH10+). Plasma EGFRm (Ex19del\/L858R only) analysis was conducted by ddPCR at D1 and every week thereafter for 4 weeks and at week 6. Plasma EGFRm clearance was defined as undetected EGFRm ctDNA at D22, where it was detected at D1. Baseline (BL) MET amplifications were determined via ctDNA NGS at D1. Agreement analysis was performed (DCO 27Aug2021). This analysis included 192 pts who received savolitinib 300 mg QD + osimertinib and had &#8805;2 post-BL RECIST scans. Of those with valid tissue FISH and IHC results and evaluable ctDNA at D1 (88% [169\/192]), 124 pts had detectable plasma EGFRm. Plasma EGFRm clearance was assessed in 103 pts with detectable D1 plasma EGFRm who also had evaluable ctDNA at D22. Clearance was observed more frequently in pts with IHC90+ or FISH10+ tumors (42% [28\/66]) than those with IHC90- and FISH10- tumors (16% [6\/37]). Median PFS (95% CI) with vs without clearance was 11.0 (7.4, 13.0) vs 4.1 (2.7, 5.5) months in pts with IHC90+ or FISH10+ tumors. Agreement between tissue FISH and plasma NGS was assessed in 72 evaluable pts. Overall, 21 (29%) pts had MET FISH10+ tumors and 14 (19%) had plasma NGS focal MET amplification, with 11 being positive by both methods (positive percent agreement [PA]: 52%, negative PA: 94%, overall PA: 67%). Plasma EGFRm clearance was observed after 3 wks of savolitinib + osimertinib, particularly in pts with MET IHC90+ or FISH10+ tumors and was associated with improved PFS.

Multivariate analysis indicated the MEL38 score is significantly different between ICM vs other disease states, independent of patient age, gender, biopsy site or plasma type (fresh vs archival) at P&#60;0.001. In the ICM subset of patients (AJCC Stage I to 4), the MEL38 score was significantly associated with MSS (log rank P=0.0011).<br \/>An optimised 12-microRNA signature (MEL12) specifically for melanoma prognosis was developed to compliment the diagnostic ability of MEL38. Rates of MSS between low, standard and high-risk MEL12 groups were 94%, 78% and 58% respectively (Log rank P&#60;0.001). Risk group assignment by MEL12 was significantly associated with clinical staging (Chi square P&#60;0.001) and SLNB status (P=0.027). Melanoma was detected in the SLNB of 87% of patients with the high risk MEL12 profile. The observed differences in MSS between MEL12 risk groups remained statistically significant when adjusted for variation in patient age, gender, systemic treatment and local vs metastatic melanoma.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b><b><\/b> In a large series of clinically annotated plasma samples, the MEL38 signature was able to accurately stratify patients with ICM from those with non-ICM conditions associated with negligible or dramatically lower risk of mortality. In patients clinically or genomically-diagnosed with ICM, the MEL12 signature can provide a prognostic assessment, significantly related to SLNB status, clinical stage, and probability of 10-year MSS. Adoption of plasma microRNA profiling in the clinic may facilitate personalised, risk-informed treatment decisions, and potentially reducing the rates of melanoma under and over diagnosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,Malignant melanoma,Liquid biopsies,Gene expression profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ryan Van Laar<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Babak Latif<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sam King<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Love<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nadine Taubenheim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Esha Kalanooriya<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wandi Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mirette Saad<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ingrid Winship<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tony Landgren<\/i><\/presenter>.

We developed a versatile, tissue-free (ie, no tumor tissue required), multi-cancer detection test (&#8220;Post-Diagnosis Cancer Research Solution&#8221;) based on methylation sequencing of cfDNA from blood. This technology solution can be used to evaluate cfDNA applications in cancer research, including treatment evaluation, recurrence monitoring, and prognostic guidance. We report the analytical validation of this Post-Diagnosis Cancer Research Solution, characterizing sensitivity, specificity, precision, and input range.<br \/>Methods: cfDNA samples from cancer and non-cancer donors were analyzed. Analytical sensitivity (LoD95, limit of detection with &#8805;95% probability) was determined as a function of methyl variant allele fraction (MVAF), a measure of circulating tumor allele fraction. A total of 6 ng of cfDNA was used (cancer cfDNA titrated into a background of non-cancer cfDNA). LoD95 was defined as the lowest observed MVAF with &#8805;95% cancer signal detection across tested replicates or was estimated using probit regression for eligible samples. Analytical specificity was the rate of non-cancer classification among samples from 128 non-cancer donors. Precision (defined as concordance with the expected cancer\/non-cancer result) was evaluated for 15 cancer donors tested near sample LoD95 and 8 non-cancer donors, with &#8805;18 replicates\/donor. Reliability of classification was evaluated as a function of cfDNA input mass (0.25-100 ng total cfDNA, 14 cancer and 2 non-cancer donors).<br \/>Results: A total of 12 different solid cancer types from 22 individuals with cancer were assessed in the LoD95 analysis. Median LoD95 at 6 ng total cfDNA input was 0.023% (10th percentile 0.0037%; 90th percentile 0.04%) MVAF. LoD95 estimates from <i>in silico<\/i> titration analyses of &#62;200 clinical samples across a subset of the 12 cancer types were consistent with experimental LoD95 values. Analytical specificity was determined to be 98.47% (95% CI: 94.60-99.58%). Median precision across individuals was 100% (10th percentile 87%; 90th percentile 100%). Classification performance was accurate and consistent across a wide range of cfDNA input mass (100% correct cancer\/non-cancer classification from 1.5-100 ng).<br \/>Conclusions: Results demonstrate that this multi-cancer Post-Diagnosis Cancer Research Solution has high analytical sensitivity, specificity, and precision, with reliable performance across a broad cfDNA input range. This technology does not require a tumor sample and provides a cancer signal estimate in terms of MVAF. These features may enable understanding of cfDNA dynamics in a wide variety of cancers for research studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer detection,DNA methylation,Circulating cell-free DNA, Analytical validation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mohini Desai<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Svetlana Rakhmanova Shchegrov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shoujie Chai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yifan Zhou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tracy Nguyen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yirang Cho<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Collin Melton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eric Scott<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Manami Roychowdhury-Saha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pei-Yun Chang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rita Shaknovich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Byoungsok Jung<\/i><\/presenter>.

Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), characterized by gain of stem-like and neuroendocrine features and lack of AR expression is a clinically aggressive variant. Due to the absence of adequate biomarkers, NEPC is usually detected at a very advanced stage. There is mounting evidence that molecular subtype changes seen in NEPC are enforced by widespread epigenetic alterations, in particular DNA methylation changes. In this study, we aim to devise a novel DNA methylation-based assay for molecular subtyping and disease monitoring from cell-free DNA (cfDNA).<br \/>Methods: We analyzed genome wide methylation patterns in 60 prostate cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and 133 mCRPC tumors using array- and sequencing-based assays. We integrated DNA methylation with TF cistrome data to determine the landscape of methylation alterations at key lineage TF binding sites (TFBS). A linear regression model was trained on low-pass Enzymatic Methyl-Seq (EM-seq) cfDNA data derived from PDXs to identify molecular subtype specific DNA methylation changes at these TFBS. The model performance was optimized with <i>in silico<\/i> admixture experiments. This model was then used to discern tumor molecular phenotypes from cfDNA in three independent cohorts of mCRPC patients using low-pass whole genome bisulfite sequencing and EM-seq.<br \/>Results: <b> <\/b>We observed a strong association between TFBS methylation and TF expression. For lineage specific TFs such as AR and ASCL1, we identified core sets of TFBSs whose differential methylation allowed for accurate assay-independent molecular subtype classification in tumor tissues. Applying an optimized quantitative model to mCRPC patients who underwent comprehensive tissue sampling by rapid autopsy we observed perfect subtype prediction from both tissue samples and cfDNA (AUC=1). A similar analytical performance was observed in additional clinical mCRPC cohorts with cfDNA.<br \/>Conclusions: We show that methylation patterns at TFBSs can determine TF activity and can be used to classify molecular subtypes from both tumor tissue and cfDNA. For prostate cancer, we demonstrate that this approach can accurately detect NEPC by cost-effective low-pass EM-seq. More broadly, this study provides a novel analysis framework for robustly assessing molecular tumor phenotypes in cfDNA with applications in solid and liquid tumor diagnostics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Molecular profiling,Methylation,Cell-free DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mohamed Adil<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Brian Hanratty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pallabi Mustafi<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ilsa Coleman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Radhika Patel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anna-Lisa Doebley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Patton<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eden Cruikshank<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Patricia Galipeau<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruth Dumpit<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martine Roudier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jin-Yih Low<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Navonil De Sarkar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Robert Montgomery<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Eva Corey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Colm Morrissey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Nelson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Gavin Ha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Haffner<\/i><\/presenter>.

The molecular mechanism of synergy was also evaluated in KPC mice tumors and in biopsies from patients enrolled in the Phase I portion of the trial using spatial transcriptomic and proteomic analysis.

Recent studies have established that pharmacological inhibition of ATR is clinically promising. As M1774 is an oral ATR inhibitor in clinical development, we explored the molecular basis by which M1774 induces cancer cell death. As a single agent, we found that M1774 suppresses cancer cell viability at nanomolar concentrations with a potency higher than ceralasertib and berzosertib, but lower than gartisertib (M4344) and elimusertib in the small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines H146, H82, and DMS114. We found that M1774 efficiently suppresses the ATR\/CHK1 checkpoints. While M1774 alone induced apoptosis and G2\/M cell cycle arrest at micromolar concentrations, at a non-toxic low dose, M1774 enhanced TOP1 inhibitor-mediated cancer cell death by preventing replication arrest and inducing DNA damage detected by EdU and &#947;H2AX staining. Tandem mass tagging (TMT) coupled with mass spectrometry revealed that M1774 combined with SN-38 increases the expression of replication-related proteins (TIPIN, CDC45, TIMELESS, and RPA1) and G2\/M-related proteins (PLK1 and CCNB1). To establish the synergistic combinations of M1774 with clinical anticancer DNA damaging agents in preclinical models, we performed experiments in cancer cell lines, patient-derived organoids, and xenograft models. Low doses of M1774 significantly synergized with the clinical TOP1 inhibitor SN-38, the TOP2 inhibitor etoposide, cisplatin, and the PARP inhibitor talazoparib in SCLC cell lines. We also found that M1774 significantly reversed chemoresistance to DNA-damaging agents in cancer cells lacking SLFN11 expression, suggesting that SLFN11 expression can be utilized for combination therapy with M1774 as a biomarker. The synergistic efficacy between M1774 and DNA-damaging agents was confirmed in SCLC patient-derived organoids, colon cancer patient-derived organoids, and H82 SCLC xenografts. Together, these results provide insights into the molecular mechanism and potential combination strategies for M1774 in cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ATR,DNA damage,DNA replication,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Ukhyun Jo<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yasuhiro Arakawa<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Astrid Zimmermann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daiki Taniyama<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Makito Mizunuma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lisa M Jenkins<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Suresh Kumar<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Frank T Zenke<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yves Pommier<\/i><\/presenter>.

Radiotherapy (RT) may enhance the anti-tumor effect of immunotherapy. However, the outcomes of RT on pts receiving targeted therapy plus ICIs remains unclear. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the association between RT exposure and clinical responses to fruquintinib plus sintilimab (F&#38;S) in previously treated MSS-CRC and explore predictive biomarkers.<br \/>Methods: This prospective observational cohort study assessed treatment outcomes of F&#38;S as the third- or further-line therapy for advanced CRC pts at Wuhan Union Hospital from Mar 2021 to Jun 2022 (NCT05635149). The pts were divided into two cohorts according to their RT history. The objective response rate (ORR) was set as the primary endpoint. We collected pre-treatment stool samples from pts for microbiota sequencing.<br \/>Results: A total of 55 pts were enrolled, of whom 25 pts received prior RT (RT cohort, RTC) and the other 30 pts had no exposure to RT (non-RT cohort, NRTC). Globally, the objective response rate (ORR) was 18.0%, the DCR was 56.3%, and the median PFS (mPFS) was 3.6 mo. When compared between the two cohorts, the ORR was 28.0% vs. 6.7% (OR=7.344, P=0.039, RTC vs. NRTC, the same hereinafter), the DCR was 80.0% vs. 36.7% (OR=7.991, P=0.010), and the mPFS was 6.1 mo vs. 2.6 mo (HR=0.286, P&#60;0.001). Multivariate COX regression showed that RT was an independent factor on the PFS. Overall, 27 (49.1%) pts experienced grade 1 or 2 adverse events (AEs), and grade 3 AEs were observed in 7 (12.7%) pts. The most common AEs included hepatotoxicity, hypertension and hand-foot syndrome. Moreover, analysis of gut microbiome (n=20) showed there was also significant difference in mPFS of pts in RTC (n=8) versus NRTC (n=12) (6.1 mo vs. 3.1 mo, P=0.002). Bifidobacterium and lactobacillus enriched significantly in RTC at the genus level, and further ROC curve identified the coexistence of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus enrichment predicted greater DCR (AUC=0.909), enhancing their potential as biomarkers for response. Furthermore, we found that high abundance of lactobacillus was also strongly associated with prolonged PFS (P=0.043).<br \/>Conclusion: In this study, we found that pts with RT exposure could benefit more from F&#38;S as the third- or further-line therapy in MSS colorectal cancer. Furthermore, bifidobacteria and lactobacillus enriched in baseline stool samples from pts in RTC, which may be potential biomarkers for outcomes. Further studies with larger scale sample size are warranted to validate our findings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Targeted therapy,PD-1,Radiotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Min Jin<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mingxia Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shengli Yang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lei Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dandan Yu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Zhenyu Lin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pindong Li<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jing Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jun Xue<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hong Ma<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jianli Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tao Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hongli Liu<\/i><\/presenter>.

To achieve rapid colonialization throughout the central nervous system, glioblastoma cells have to be equipped with a high resistance to several forms of programmed cell death, such as apoptosis. All this occurs in the absence of any tumor-initiated signature mutations. Using a comprehensive comparative analysis combining expression profiles and functional analysis of normal brain glia cells, primary tumors and tumor-derived organoids with distinct differentiation subtypes we investigated the underlying features associated with the high resistance to cell death-induced by conventional treatment. To break this resistance, we looked into the possibility to add the small molecule inhibitor Venetoclax, that targets the Bcl-2 family, to conventional therapy. The Bcl-2 family are a number of evolutionarily-conserved proteins that share Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains and are most notable for their regulation of apoptosis at the mitochondrion. Interestingly, although stem cell-like cells (SCs) express more pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins than their differentiated progeny they remain more resistant to apoptosis, suggesting that the Bcl-2 family is not the main mediator of apoptosis resistance. In stark contrast to leukemia cells, inhibition of Bcl-2 alone has no effect on glioblastoma cells, but combining this with either Temozolomide (TMZ), the standard chemotherapeutic option, or serum starvation leads to synergistic effects. These are, however, weak hence we investigated whether compensatory mechanisms are activated. Indeed, in both SCs and DCs we found an upregulation of Mcl-1, a molecule known to compensate for inhibited Bcl-2. However, additionally blocking Mcl-1 with several different small molecule inhibitors did not further sensitize primary Glioblastoma cells. This suggests that while mechanical upregulation of Mcl-1 occurs in Glioblastoma, it is of little functional consequence. The reduced importance of the Bcl-2 family is also reflected in the non-transformed astrocytes which are precursor of glioblastoma. They already display an intrinsic high resistance to apoptotic cell death. Treatment with TMZ and modulators of apoptosis does not significantly affect their viability. Our findings suggest that the Bcl-2 family has a reduced role in mediating the survival of brain cells, at least when compared to haemopoietic cells. While a certain sensitizing effect can be achieved in Glioblastoma cells by combining cellular stressors with inhibitors of the Bcl-2 family, this is unlikely to be a sufficient to overcome therapy resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL09-01 Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bcl-2 protein family,Brain\/central nervous system cancers,Mcl-1,Glioblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Helene Von Bandemer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Felix Seyfried<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Anne Fleischmann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Georg Karpel-Massler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aurelia Peraud<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hannah Strobel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marcin Lyszkiewicz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Klaus Michael Debatin<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Mike Andrew Westhoff<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
