[{"Abstract":"Background: Clinical response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is predicated upon the existence of tumor-reactive T cells, but their precise targets remain poorly defined. Some patients with low tumor mutational burden (TMB) lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) derive clinical benefit from ICB, suggesting that non-mutated antigens may serve as T cell targets. Human endogenous retroviruses (hERVs) can be differentially expressed in malignant cells due to epigenetic dysregulation and can be targeted by T cells. We hypothesize that the detection of T cell responses against hERVs correlates with a favorable clinical response to ICB in LUAD.<br \/>Methods: Tumor tissues from patients with Stage I-III LUAD who underwent upfront surgical resection were enzymatically digested. Viable CD45<sup>-<\/sup>EPCAM<sup>+<\/sup> cells were sorted. Total RNA was extracted and RNA sequencing was performed. The hervQUANT workflow was used to bioinformatically identify differentially-expressed, open reading frame (ORF)-encoding hERV transcripts. Publicly available RNAseq datasets derived from human medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) and normal tissues were queried to exclude hERV transcripts expressed in these tissues. Overlapping peptide libraries (OPLs) spanning the shared hERV ORFs were synthesized and used in Functional Expansion of Specific T Cells (FEST) assays to detect hERV-specific T cell clones in the peripheral blood of a cohort of patients who met these criteria: (1) had advanced\/metastatic LUAD, (2) were treated with ICB, (3) had peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated at 4-8 weeks post-initiation of ICB and (4) had formal radiographic assessment of response to ICB.<br \/>Results: We identified 41 differentially-expressed, ORF-encoding hERV transcripts that were shared by &#8805;4 (out of 11) CD45<sup>-<\/sup>EPCAM<sup>+<\/sup> LUAD samples. OPLs covering hERV ORFs with mean expression of &#8805; 3 CPM in CD45<sup>-<\/sup>EPCAM<sup>+<\/sup> LUAD cells and &#60;3 CPM in mTECs were synthesized. Low expression in normal tissues was also confirmed (&#60;3 CPM). A total of 318 patients were screened and 30 patients (22 radiographic responders and 8 non-responders) met the inclusion criteria. The median age was 66.5 years for responders and 58 years for non-responders. The median PD-L1 TPS was 72.5% and 70%, respectively. The median TMB was 8 and 2.55, respectively. FEST assays utilizing hERV OPLs revealed 4 potential hERV-reactive T cell clonotypes in the peripheral blood of 2 patients with LUAD treated with ICB. Studies are ongoing to validate and characterize these clonotypes. Testing of the remainder of the selected patient cohort is also ongoing.<br \/>Conclusions: Potential hERV-reactive T cell clonotypes are detectable in ICB-treated patients with LUAD. Correlation with clinical response to ICB will be evaluated upon validation of these clonotypes, but these results are promising findings in the ongoing efforts to identify immunogenic sources of non-mutated antigens in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Immune checkpoint blockade,Immune response,Tumor antigen,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Khaled Sanber<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sydney Connor<sup>1<\/sup>, Steven Vensko<sup>2<\/sup>, Christopher Cherry<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhen Zeng<sup>1<\/sup>, Drew Pardoll<sup>1<\/sup>, Patrick Forde<sup>1<\/sup>, Benjamin Vincent<sup>2<\/sup>, Kellie Smith<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD,<sup>2<\/sup>Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7d0d38a9-a484-4c5e-abf4-0a596ceddf0f","ControlNumber":"2721","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

LOAd703 is an immunostimulatory gene therapy utilizing an oncolytic adenovirus that is engineered to express two transgenes (trimerized membrane-bound CD40L (TMZ-CD40L) and 4-1BBL), which are key players in the induction of an anti-tumor immune response. Herein, we present the preliminary immunological evaluation of the first 27 patients enrolled in the trial. The primary tumor was pancreatic cancer (n=16), colorectal cancer (n=5), ovarian cancer (n=3) or biliary cancer (n=3). Patients received a maximum of eight intratumoral LOAd703 treatments, given biweekly, and chemotherapy was administered at the same time according to standard protocol. Matched tumor biopsies from the injected tumor lesion were taken at baseline and after six LOAd703 treatments, and analyzed for gene expression with nCounter&#174; PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel from NanoString (n=12; 7 patients analyzed so far). Blood samples were collected for isolation of serum samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and these were analyzed with multiplex assays (Meso Scale Diagnostics) (n=15) and flow cytometry (n=27), respectively. Preliminary results indicate that after treatment, most tumors displayed a strong inflammatory profile with an upregulation of gene profiles, which have been shown to predict responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (T cell inflamed profile (Ayers et al.) &#38; T effector and IFN&#947; associated profile (Fehrenbacher et al.)). We also noted an upregulation of genes connected to dendritic cell activation and antigen presentation (MHC class I and II, CD80, CD86, TAP1\/2), as well as adenoviral-response genes. Moreover, we observed systemic treatment effects after three LOAd703 treatments, as shown by an increase in serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IFN&#947;, IL-15, CXCL10, CCL2, IL-8, IL-6), as well as an increased percentage of CD8+ effector memory T cells (CD45RA-CCR7-) and PD-1+ CD8+ T cells in the blood. The fractions of natural killer (NK) cells (CD14-CD3-CD56+CD16+) and M2-like macrophages (CD11b+CD163+) were reduced in the blood at that time point. In conclusion, LOAd703 therapy in combination with chemotherapy generated an inflamed tumor microenvironment in tumors that are normally seen as immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221;. Hence, LOAd703 may be able to prime tumors for immune checkpoint inhibitors or other immunotherapies, such as adoptive T or NK cell transfer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncolytic adenovirus,Gene therapy,CD40L,4-1BBL,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jessica Wenthe<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Emma Eriksson<sup>2<\/sup>, Sedigheh Naseri<sup>1<\/sup>, Linda Sandin<sup>3<\/sup>, Amanda Hahn<sup>1<\/sup>, Sandra Irenaeus<sup>1<\/sup>, Anders Sundin<sup>1<\/sup>, Justyna Leja-Jarblad<sup>3<\/sup>, Gustav Ullenhag<sup>1<\/sup>, Tanja Lövgren<sup>1<\/sup>, Angelica Loskog<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden,<sup>2<\/sup>Uppsala University\/Lokon Pharma AB, Uppsala, Sweden,<sup>3<\/sup>Lokon Pharma AB, Uppsala, Sweden","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"25e6cf4f-4203-434d-82e0-0d0a8cb5ea9f","ControlNumber":"4559","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Here, we developed an immunoprofiling platform to evaluate the features in the blood of cancer patients to test the hypothesis that peripheral immune cell heterogeneity could be used to stratify these patients into different categories or immunotypes to monitor disease progression and treatment response.<br \/>To that end, we established a unique diagnostic immunoprofiling assay and analytical framework based on the analysis of leukocytes in the peripheral blood using multiparameter flow cytometry. Supervised manual gating of flow cytometry data from a cohort of 50 healthy donors identified 415 cell types and immune activation states that were used to train and later independently validate machine learning models to automatically identify immune cell subsets from raw cytometry data. By applying this tool to peripheral blood samples from a mixed cohort of 299 healthy donors and 323 cancer patients, we developed a machine-learning classification model that can differentiate between these two groups with 93% accuracy. This model was further refined using spectral clustering with bootstrapping, revealing 5 clusters, or immunotypes, characterized by specific physiological immune profiles: (1) Myeloid-derived suppressor\/NK cell, (2) Terminally-differentiated CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, (3) Mixed CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T helper cells, (4) CD4<sup>+<\/sup> Th1 &#38; CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell memory, and (5) Naive T and B lymphocytes. Interestingly, very few healthy donors could be found in clusters 1 and 2 but were assigned most frequently to cluster 5.<br \/>Matched RNA-seq was used to further validate these profiles using the cellular deconvolution algorithm, Kassandra, and differential gene expression analysis revealed immunotype-specific signatures that are consistent with immune response potential. Patients in the terminally-differentiated CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell cluster had a narrower range of HLA-types than the other clusters, and TCR repertoire analysis indicated significantly increased clonality and reduced clonotype diversity. Within this cluster there was a high degree of overlap between TCR sequences in the peripheral blood and the tumor, indicating a relationship between peripheral blood immunotype and tumor infiltration. Altogether, the establishment of these immunotypes using peripheral blood immunoprofiling represents a promising signature that can be used to identify and stratify cancer patients that will benefit from immune-based therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunoassay,Flow cytometry,Immune response,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Daniiar Dyikanov<sup><\/sup>, Iris Wang<sup><\/sup>, Tatiana Vasileva<sup><\/sup>, Polina Shpudeiko<sup><\/sup>, Polina Turova<sup><\/sup>, Arseniy A.

To date, no study has been conducted to characterize the single-cell kinetics of tumor-infiltrating immune populations in gastric cancer patients treated with ICB. Here, we generated for the first time single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and TCR sequencing (scTCR-seq) profiles of ICB-treated primary GC tumors, as well as liver and ovary metastases. When integrated with public scRNA-seq datasets, our data capture a full trajectory of GC malignancy comprising more than 300,000 cells derived from 73 samples. We further performed bulk TCR-seq, cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF), and multiplex immunofluorescence (mxIF) on independent GC samples to orthogonally validate the key observations from the scRNA-seq cohort and unbiasedly search for more in-depth and spatial-relationship-focused features of ICB-responsive immune populations. Built upon this multi-omic atlas of GC cell states, we identified remarkable transformation of the abundance and clonal dynamics of distinct immune populations and their population-specific transcriptional programs. Most importantly, we observed the rejuvenation of exhausted CD8+ T cells induced by anti-PD-1 treatment, which is associated with the enhanced immunogenicity of gastric cancer cells. In addition, we found the enrichment of NK-like terminally differentiated CD8+ T cells in metastases independent of migration destinations. Our single-cell ICB-perturbed spatiotemporal GC landscape reveals how neoadjuvant checkpoint blockade induces local and systemic tumor immunity. As a cellular and molecular reference, it also enables high-resolution interpretation of future single-cell omics data in gastric cancer that may be masked by de novo analysis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Immune checkpoint blockade,Microenvironment,Gastric cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yikai Luo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Muxing Kang<sup>2<\/sup>, Wei Liu<sup>3<\/sup>, Shiping Jiao<sup>4<\/sup>, Lie Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Jian Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Han Liang<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>4<\/sup>The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ddb9f582-c052-49a2-aca6-2148b0c7b3c1","ControlNumber":"1363","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Immune cells can encourage tumor growth, leading to disease progression. A high number of immune cells may be predictive of disease prognosis and response to therapies. Therefore, understanding the immune cell phenotypes present within cancerous tissue can be valuable in developing strategies that aid in the treatment of cancer. In this study, we analyzed pre-and post-therapy samples from breast cancer patients, treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, using a 6-plex immunofluorescence assay which included clinically relevant immuno-oncology biomarkers (FoxP3, PD-L1, PanCK, CD4, CD8 and CD163). This assay was developed and optimized in-house prior to testing the cohort. Endpoints for this analysis were characterization of the tumor microenvironment and analysis of the individual immune cell subsets pre and post treatment. Staining was completed on the Leica Bond RX autostainer (Leica Biosystems) and slides were scanned using the PhenoImager&#8482; Fusion (Akoya Biosciences). Using Visiopharm&#174; software, the multiplex phenotyping module was used to analyze the high dimensional human tissue and cell phenotypes were detected using artificial intelligence. Qualitative and quantitative results revealed a change in immune cell phenotypes between pre- and post-therapy samples. These included an increase in intra-tumoral and stromal T cells, no significant difference in PD-L1 positive cells, and an increase in the FOXP3 positive T cells in post-treatment samples. Our data provides insights into the development and application of multispectral imaging for characterization of tumor microenvironment and its dynamics before and after treatment in breast cancer. This can be applied to other cancer types and can aid in making treatment decisions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Biomarkers,Multiplex automation,Immune response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Bhavika Patel<sup><\/sup>, Stephanie Allen<sup><\/sup>, Brenna Dennison<sup><\/sup>, Jacob Stapleton<sup><\/sup>, Roni Archuleta<sup><\/sup>, Mary Lou Rath<sup><\/sup>, Navi Mehra<sup><\/sup>, <b>Sameer  S.

However, overcoming local T-cell dysfunction necessitates systemic immunity engagement. Therefore, studying the dynamics of both local and peripheral T-cell repertoires in response to ICB is required to identify features of T-cell repertoires associated with pathological response.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We conducted TCR&#946;-sequencing on tumor-residing T-cells (n=59), Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) (n=306) and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) (n=73) from pre- and multiple on-ICB timepoints collected from patients enrolled in the pan-cancer INvestigator-initiated Phase II Study of Pembrolizumab Immunological Response Evaluation (INSPIRE; NCT02644369) trial. To assess specificity-agnostic shifts in TCR repertoires, we first compared TCR diversity and clonal expansion in longitudinal tumor and PBMC samples. Then, to temporally track the specificity-associated features of local and systemic TCR repertoires, we leveraged a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model that took in unique TCR&#946; chains as nodes. The connectivity between the nodes was defined by multi-relational edges that represented VJ-gene usage and GLIPHII-identified (Grouping Lymphocyte Interactions by Paratope Hotspots) specificities derived from a compendium of TCR sequences with empirically confirmed specificities. <b>Results: <\/b>While absolute diversity and clonal expansion values in baseline tumor (n=33) were not associated with response to ICB, changes in these values were informative between pre- and on-ICB tumors. All patients (n=4) with low baseline tumor TCR diversity and lack of clonotypic re-structuring in tumor TCR repertoire on-ICB had either progressive or short-term stable disease. Furthermore, pairwise comparison of pre- and on-ICB tumors for each patient (n=17) revealed that all the patients, irrespective of their pathological response, experienced emergence of new TCR clonotypes (i.e., clonal replacement) in response to ICB, suggesting only a minority of these TCRs might consist of tumor-associated clonotypes. Patients with clinical benefit also had higher degree of GLIPHII-identified clustering at baseline tumor, highlighting the role of both specificity-agnostic and specificity-centric TCR analysis in determining the response to ICB. Analysis of TCR sequences in blood plasma found cfDNA contains a small number of TCR sequences (median 32, range 12-89) enriched for TCRs found in matched tumor tissues, suggesting that cfDNA TCR repertoire may provide an indirect measurement of tumor-residing T-cells.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>TCR diversity and functional clonal annotation are emerging biomarkers of ICB response and cfDNA TCR repertoire can potentially be exploited for clinical diagnostics and monitoring.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell,Tumor immunity,Peripheral Immune cells,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shirin Soleimani<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ben  X.

Predictors and molecular drivers of disease relapse, especially the role of intra-tumoral immune dysfunction, remains unclear but critical for the refinement of therapeutic decisions. By leveraging a comprehensive individual portrait of each patient's immune system potential novel mechanisms associated with tumor relapse in early-stage NSCLC may be identified. We profiled 11 non-relapsed (at least 2 year FU) lung adenocarcinoma patients and 11 covariate-matched (gender, age, stage) relapsed patients, who underwent curative treatment in stage IA-IIIB disease. We used NeXT Summit<sup>TM<\/sup> for variant and CNA calling, gene expression quantification, neoantigen prediction, HLA profiling (typing, mutation, and loss of heterozygosity), T-cell receptor and tumor microenvironment (TME) profiling. Neoantigen peptide sequences were subjected to further filtering and clustering based on between-patient similarity scores, with the goal of identifying shared clusters of relapse-associated neoantigens in each possible pair of patients. Differential network analyses were applied to the TME composition estimates to investigate relapse-associated patterns of cellular co-occurrence and interaction. When considering neoantigens selected on the basis of similarity, we found that those belonging to non-relapsed patients had significantly lower HLA binding rank (17.8 points) compared to that of relapsed patients (P=0.02), indicating weaker binding for relapsed cases. Clustering of both the most similar and frequently shared neoantigens correlated with relapse (P &#60; 0.002). In the TME, we observed differential immune cell co-occurrence associated with relapse status, such as Tregs are positively correlated with B and CD4 T cells only in relapsed patients (Pearson&#8217;s R=0.7 and 0.74, both P&#60;0.02 vs. R=0.18 and 0.35, both P&#62;0.2 in non-relapsed patients), indicating suppressive anti-tumor immunity. Relapsed patients did not share significant enrichment of mutations in any biological pathway. Surprisingly, mutation purity (less mutations than expected by chance) was observed in relapsed patients, suggesting selective killing and escape. In this pilot cohort, we used an integrated platform to broadly characterize both the tumor and immune system, enabling identification of relapse-associated neoantigens that may share universal features which enhance HLA binding. Relapses in early-stage LUAD patients were associated with neoantigens with lower immunogenicity and an immunosuppressive TME. These findings demonstrate that deeper profiling of shared neoantigen features has the potential to become an early biomarker of relapse, informing patient therapy selection and surveillance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Immuno-oncology,Prognosis,Neoantigens,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Martina  M.

In this correlative analysis, we identify molecular features associated with response and survival. Associations of molecular subtype, TMB, and antigen presentation and immune checkpoint gene expression with response and survival were evaluated pre-and post-treatment. Neoantigens were predicted in 4 immuno-oncology data sets (LCCC1520, IMvigor210 cohorts 1[2] and 2[3], and Hugo[4]) using Landscape of Effective Neoantigens Software[5]. Effective neoantigen count (ENC) was calculated by binning predicted neoantigens by expression, binding affinity, binding stability, and tumor PD-1 and PD-L1 expression, then identifying the bin in which neoantigen count was most strongly associated with response in the discovery set. Using elastic net modeling with 10-fold cross-validation, survival was predicted from immune gene signature expression, clinical variables, TMB and ENC. Response was associated with pre-treatment molecular subtype and immune checkpoint expression. Pre-treatment ENC was associated with response in Hugo (discovery set, p = 0.020) and the three validation sets (p = 0.011, 0.042, 0.049). The final elastic net model (Cox P-H p = 5.6e-5) predicted survival significantly better than TMB (p = 0.055) or ENC (p = 0.141) alone. Post-treatment antigen presentation gene expression was associated with survival among non-responders.

There is no clinical assay to predict who will develop severe ICI-induced irAEs and who will not. Using single-cell profiling assays applied to a retrospective melanoma cohort treated with ICIs, we recently showed that higher baseline levels of circulating CD4 effector memory T (TEM) cells were associated with severe irAE development, independent of the affected organ system (Lozano et al. <i>Nature Medicine<\/i>, 2022). As part of a prospective validation study of 100 melanoma patients, here we report our initial findings on the first 24 patients accrued to date.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: We prospectively collected pre-ICI blood from 24 metastatic melanoma patients from two academic medical centers from February 2021 onward. Peripheral blood was collected pre-treatment on the day of immunotherapy (cycle 1 day 1). We then isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and applied mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) to profile 38 leukocyte markers including markers specific to CD4 TEM cells. Cellular subpopulations were quantified using Cytobank v9. Patients underwent routine medical oncology follow-up during and after ICI treatment including grading of irAEs using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Median follow-up time after pre-ICI blood collection was 9.1 months (range 2.6-18.5). Fifteen (63%) patients received combination (anti-PD1 \/ anti-CTLA4) ICIs while the remainder received anti-PD1 monotherapy. Eight patients developed severe (grade 3+) irAEs at a median of 8.5 weeks (range 4-21) after treatment initiation, including 4 who developed life-threatening (grade 4) irAEs. Severe and life-threatening irAE development spanned 9 separate organ systems, most commonly gastrointestinal, dermatological, and hepatic. Using CyTOF, we found that circulating CD4 TEM cells were more abundant in patients who developed severe irAEs compared to those who did not (<i>P<\/i> = 0.01; AUC = 0.81), irrespective of the involved organ systems. Moreover, median-splitting the patient cohort into two groups based on pretreatment CD4 TEM levels revealed that patients with low CD4 TEMs had significantly longer freedom from severe irAE than those with high CD4 TEMs (not reached vs. 4.6 months; <i>P <\/i>= 0.013; HR = 6.7). There was no significant difference in pretreatment CD4 TEM levels between patients with and without durable clinical benefit to ICIs (<i>P<\/i> = 0.75).<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Circulating CD4 TEM levels measured by CyTOF were associated with severe irAE development, independent of response status, in patients with advanced melanoma.

Both the adaptive and innate arms of the immune system play important roles in generating pro- or anti-tumor milieus. In particular, natural killer (NK) cells are gaining increasing attention as potential cell-based therapies in immuno-oncology, including in adoptive transfer of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and iPSC-derived NK cells or off-the-shelf NK cell lines to target multiple myeloma. Since NK cells can also indirectly impact CAR T cell or antibody-based immunotherapies, characterizing these cells using optimized and reproducible assays is critical. CyTOF&#174; is a high-plex flow cytometry technology that exploits metal-isotope-tagged antibodies to probe cellular phenotypes and functions. In contrast to fluorescence-based conventional and spectral flow cytometry, CyTOF experimental workflows are streamlined as autofluorescence is not an issue and signal spillover is minimal, allowing rapid design and application of 40-plus-marker panels. To expand on the increasing clinical and preclinical utility of the 30-marker Maxpar&#174; Direct&#8482; Immune Profiling Assay&#8482; (Maxpar Direct Assay), we developed nine add-on Expansion Panels for deeper phenotyping of specific cell types and activation states, including panels designed to characterize <i>ex vivo<\/i> and activated myeloid cells, T cells, and NK cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors and donors with multiple myeloma were stimulated <i>in vitro<\/i>, then stained in the 30-antibody Maxpar Direct Assay tube with the NK Cell Expansion Panel (CD181, NKp30, NKp46, PD-1, NKG2A, ICOS, and TIGIT) or the T Cell Panel 3 (OX40, TIGIT, CD69, PD-1, Tim-3, ICOS, and 4-1BB) as drop-in antibodies. Surface staining was followed by intracellular staining with the Basic Activation Expansion Panel antibodies (IL-2, TNF&#945;, IFN&#947;, perforin, granzyme B) after cell fixation and permeabilization. Anti-CD107a was added during stimulation to measure degranulation. Samples were acquired on a CyTOF XT&#8482; instrument in automated batch acquisition mode. Automated analysis was performed with Maxpar Pathsetter&#8482; software to enumerate immune cell types and quantify marker expression. In addition to the 37 populations identified by Pathsetter with the base Maxpar Direct Assay, the new Expansion Panels allowed deeper profiling of NK and T cells, while the Basic Activation Panel revealed their cytokine responsiveness and cytotoxic potential. Thus, the optimized single-tube Maxpar Direct Assay is a powerful tool that can be further expanded and customized with predefined panels or antibodies to comprehensively study immune cells in health and disease.<br \/>For Research Use Only.

Current methods rely upon multiplex PCR (mPCR) amplification of rearranged IGH, IGK or IGL loci via variable and joining gene targeting primers followed by NGS to assess rearrangements. Limitations include a need for reflex testing owing to somatic hypermutation (SHM) mediated loss of sensitivity and an inability to detect clinically relevant translocations of the IGH locus. Here we apply Ring-Seq, a novel technology for the targeted detection gene fusions with unknown partners, to simultaneously detect IGH VDJ rearrangements and translocations in a single reaction. We demonstrate detection of clinically relevant translocations and VDJ rearrangements from highly degraded gDNA.<br \/>Methods: The method begins with a highly efficient circularization of DNA fragments followed by a multiplex inverse PCR of joining genes that preferentially amplifies breakpoint junction containing templates. Amplicon libraries are sequenced on the G4 platform and analyzed to detect translocations and VDJ rearrangements. We pooled gDNA from reference cell lines harboring marker IGH VDJ rearrangements and BCL1\/2-JH translocations. Pooled reference gDNA was spiked into a background of healthy donor PBL gDNA to evaluate performance over a range of marker frequencies. To simulate performance with degraded materials, gDNA input was fragmented to ~200bp by sonication prior to analysis.<br \/>Results: BCL1-JH and BCL2-JH translocations and marker IGH VDJ rearrangements were detected from 50ng pooled reference gDNA. Translocations and marker VDJ rearrangements were also detected in 50ng samples consisting of reference gDNA spiked at 10% and 1% frequency into a background of healthy donor PBL gDNA. Sequencing of healthy donor PBL gDNA yielded IGH repertoire features that were highly concordant with results obtained from BIOMED-2 mPCR analysis of the same samples.<br \/>Conclusions: We have applied Ring-Seq to enable the simultaneous detection of B cell receptor rearrangements and JH translocations relevant to the diagnosis of MCL and FL while minimizing loss of sensitivity owing to SHM. Traditional mPCR often fails to detect JH translocations owing to variation in the breakpoint region. Consequently, suspected MCL and FL diagnostic samples are assessed for translocations by FISH, while separate material is submitted for NGS-based VDJ clonality analysis via traditional mPCR. Ring-Seq may streamline this process by consolidating separate tests into a single rapid NGS assay for the G4 platform. Looking ahead, we envision broad applicability of the technology to mPCR-based variant detection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Translocation,Fusion genes,B cells,Sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Shannon Owens<sup><\/sup>, Katherine Fichter<sup><\/sup>, Richard Que<sup><\/sup>, Sabrina Shore<sup><\/sup>, <b>Timothy Looney<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Singular Genomics, San Diego, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"92824ea4-cd60-4935-bf24-089aaa43a5b5","ControlNumber":"6346","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Although tumor growth can be attenuated via the activation of tumor-infiltrating effector T cells, the relationship between tumor infiltration and immune activation remains unclear. This study explored the interaction between bladder cancer outcomes and immune profiles within peripheral blood and a tumor microenvironment (TME) based on DNA methylation profiles. Peripheral blood and the matched tumor FFPE DNA methylation profiles of 60 non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and 12 muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) patients. Cell-type deconvolution approaches were applied to estimate 12 peripheral immune cell-type proportions and 17 cell-type proportions within TME. We found a positive correlation between dendritic cell proportions in the TME with peripheral CD8T memory cell proportions (r = 0.35, P = 0.003) and a negative correlation between dendritic cell proportions in the TME with peripheral regulatory T cell proportions (r = -0.28, P = 0.021). In addition, monocyte cell proportions in TME had a positive correlation with peripheral B memory (r = 0.37, P = 0.002) and CD8T memory cell proportions (r = 0.43, P = 0.0002). To investigate associations of bladder cancer outcomes with immune cell profiles, using Cox proportional hazard models, we observed an association between the fraction of dendritic cells and the hazard of death (HR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.06-1.53). Further, a high endothelial cell proportion was significantly associated with an increased hazard of death and tumor recurrence (HR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.01-1.13) in TME. In addition, the peripheral neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (HR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.01-2.22), monocyte (HR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.05-1.31), neutrophil (HR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.01-1.07), and basophil (HR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.01-1.81) cell proportions were associated with an increased hazard of death and tumor recurrence. Our results integrated the information on bladder cancer outcomes and cell profiles in TME and peripheral blood, providing biomarkers for estimating bladder cancer prognosis using genome-scale DNA methylation measures.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Tumor microenvironment,Methylation,Immune cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ji-Qing Chen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lucas  A.

Needle biopsies were collected at baseline (n=8) and 4 weeks (n=6) after treatment. Blood samples were collected at baseline (n=29), 4 weeks (n=29) and 8 weeks (n=25) after treatment. Alterations in the tumor microenvironment (TME) were characterized by RNA sequencing. We analyzed the immune cell composition and activities in the blood, including 90 subpopulations of leukocytes and 29 activation\/suppression\/proliferation markers, with high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>The clinical responses are positively correlated with the induction of local anti-tumor immunity. Patients with better clinical outcomes exhibited higher levels of lymphocyte infiltration, chemokine production, and antigen-presentation potential in the local TME following one cycle of RIN treatment. The duration of progression-free survival (PFS) was correlated with a higher baseline STING signal in the TME. In the peripheral blood, the responders have more circulating CD4 T cells, B cells, and cDC1, while expressing lower immune activation markers, especially in T cells with type 1 immunity at baseline. At 4 weeks, immune activation and proliferation markers were higher in responders than non-responders. Interestingly, immune effectors (non-Tregs, CD45RA<sup>-<\/sup> CD8 T cells, NKT cells, and M1 monocytes) in the blood were proportionally reduced in responders at 4 weeks, coincident with their enrichment in the local TME. We also compared peripheral immune signatures between patients with and without liver metastases, liver metastases (n=7) were associated with a significantly lower ratio of CD4\/CD8 T cells in the blood, a phenomenon of immunosenescence, both at baseline and after RIN treatment. Lastly, the occurrence of immune-related toxicities was closely correlated with the induction of immune activities in both acellular and cellular components in the circulation.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Clinical benefit of RIN was correlated to more robust immune activation of the TME and peripheral blood following one cycle of treatment.

TGF-&#946; pathway activation is a hallmark of human immune-excluded tumors, and TGF-&#946; expression is associated with resistance to anti-PD-1 blockade. Neutralization of TGF-&#946; removes an immunosuppressive signal that drives accumulation and polarization of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in solid tumors, while EGFR inhibition targets tumor cell-intrinsic oncogenic signaling. Co-targeting of EGFR and TGF-&#946; directly impacts tumor progression while enhancing the immunogenicity of tumors.<br \/>Methods: Patients with multiple solid tumor types (CRC, pancreatic, HNSCC, SqNSCLC, and others) were treated with escalating doses of either single agent BCA101 or in combination with anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab) enrolled on NCT04429542 trial. We performed a variety of immune correlatives on pre- and on-treatment tumor biopsies, including Nanostring-based transcriptomic profiling and IHC for immunophenotypic markers, as well as multiparametric flow cytometric profiling of circulating PBMCs.<br \/>Results: Our preliminary evidence suggests that neutralization of TGF-&#946; positively alters the systemic immune state (PBMCs) and tumor immune phenotype (mRNA, IHC). Circulating HLA-DR+ monocytes were significantly increased in on-treatment PBMC samples relative to screening. Pathway analysis of on-treatment tumor biopsies revealed enhanced costimulatory signaling, cytokine and chemokine signaling, immune infiltration, and interferon signaling. Top differentially regulated genes in on-treatment biopsies included CCL21, CXCL9, CXCL11, and CXCL13, which recruit T and NK cells. HDAC11, which negative regulates type-I interferon signaling, was significantly reduced in on-treatment biopsies. Notably, two patients with EGFR-amplified squamous non-small cell lung cancer, who both progressed on first-line immunotherapy treatment, were treated with BCA101 at 1250 mg and 1500 mg qw and achieved a partial response (ongoing for 10 months at the time of the data cutoff) and a prolonged stable disease for 11 months, respectively. They exhibited increased CD8+ T cell infiltration and a reduction in TAMs following treatment.<br \/>Conclusions: Increased abundance of circulating HLA-DR+ monocytes following treatment indicated polarization towards a more positive, Th1-like systemic immune state. We observed enhanced immunogenicity of tumors as assessed by a targeted IO transcriptomic analysis. The results of the pathway analysis were supported by IHC on post-treatment biopsies from a subsequent cohort showing enhanced CD8+ T cell infiltration and stable, or reduced expression of TAM marker CD163. These results indicate that neutralization of TGF-&#946; induces a more permissive tumor immune microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-06 Immune monitoring\/clinical correlates,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,Cancer immunotherapy,TGF-&#946;,EGFR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Patrick H.
