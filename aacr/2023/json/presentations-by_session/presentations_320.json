[{"Abstract":"Multiplex Immunofluorescence (M-IF) is a technique where multiple antibodies are visualized using unique fluorophores on the same slide. Thus, instead of employing panels of separately stained IHC slides that only reveal regional localization, it enables direct visualization of numerous proteins of interest on the same cell. This enables researchers and clinicians to comprehend precise interactions taking place at the cellular level in their tissue. The challenge of figuring out how to individually link markers with fluorophores without incurring cross contamination has hindered the development of M-IF assays. The first traditional approach was to ensure each marker was generated from a unique host species, and then use secondary antibodies against those host species conjugated to unique fluorophores. As a result, the unique host species that an antibody could be generated in were exhausted forcing the researchers to reach into exotic species. The second generation of technologies attempted to temporally solve this problem by sequentially staining the markers and then stripping off the antibody in between steps; preserving the fluorophores. This system leveraged the interaction of tyramide attached to a fluorophore and its affinity for tyrosine residues in tissue to form a stronger bond then the antibody to the tissue to endure the harsh striping step. This allowed the usage of multiple antibodies from the same host species but added antigen sheltering as the confounding variable due to crowding and exhaustion of antigenic sites. The latest generation technology we are using attempts to solve this linkage problem with DNA barcoding. A lock and key mechanism wherein the primary antibody is pre-conjugated with a unique barcode and the fluorophore with a corresponding inverse barcode. In this technique the primary antibodies can be applied as a cocktail in parallel to the tissue with the dna based linkage easily and gently broken when necessary. We then took this novel technique and applied it in a shotgun approach using Tissue Microarrays (TMAs) to screen against dozens of cores from breast, endometrial, carcinoma and melanoma cases. We then use Inform software to algorithmically categorize each cell and R-Studio to statically prove a significant coefficient of variation. This creates the ability to build panels for signatures that answer key research questions like &#8220;Where are the immune cells in the tissue microenvironment&#8221; and &#8220;is the tumor hot or cold? Activated, exhausted or proliferating?&#8221;. This abstract contrasts the operation of the new technology with the earlier approaches and will demonstrate how artificial intelligence-assisted algorithms can analyze and produce statistically significant datasets for cancer researchers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Tumor microenvironment,Tumor biology,Multiplex automation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Patrick Savickas<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sharwari Phanse<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>R&D, HistoWiz, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"16e6a713-f7b3-4f93-b420-025094dcaacb","ControlNumber":"556","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

Several methods such as fluorescence in situ hybridization or RT-PCR have historically been employed, however, next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) including DNA and RNA sequencing approaches have been validated for this purpose. Here we explore the complimentary nature of these methods to enable detection of clinically relevant translocations to guide patient care.<br \/>Methods: We utilized Endeavor, a 505 gene DNA-based CGP assay developed by Personal Genome Diagnostics, to assess single nucleotide variants, insertion\/deletions, amplifications, translocations, microsatellite instability, and tumor mutation burden as well as a 53 gene RNA-based Invitae NGS FusionPlex Solid Tumor v1 assay. 151 patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including lung, colorectal, esophageal, breast, brain, bladder, and prostate cancers, were consecutively enrolled and only overlapping target regions were evaluated to compare performance.<br \/>Results: Of the 151 cases selected for the study, failure rates were 2.0% and 9.9% for Endeavor and FusionPlex, respectively. Translocations were detected in 21\/151 (13.9%) cases by Endeavor and 17\/105 (11.3%) cases by FusionPlex. For the 133 cases where data was available from both assays, 12 (9.0%) concordant translocation positive cases were detected involving <i>ALK<\/i>, <i>RET<\/i>, <i>NTRK1<\/i>, <i>NTRK3<\/i>, <i>MET<\/i> exon 14 skipping, <i>EGFR<\/i>vIII, and <i>EWSR1<\/i> with 109 (82.0%) cases translocation negative by both assays achieving a concordance rate of 91%. For 7 (5.3%) cases, Endeavor detected translocations events in <i>FGFR1<\/i>, <i>FGFR2<\/i>, <i>ETV4<\/i>, <i>ETV6<\/i>, <i>MYC<\/i>, and <i>NTRK3<\/i> that were not detected by FusionPlex. Conversely, FusionPlex identified 5 (3.8%) cases with translocations in <i>ROS1<\/i>,<i> NTRK2<\/i>, and <i>EGFR<\/i>vIII that were not detected by Endeavor (Table 1). Discrepancies in translocation detection were attributed to variability in assay failure rates, panel design, and underlying biological differences in detectability associated with DNA- and RNA-based methods.<br \/>Conclusions: In this study, comparison of translocation detection using DNA and RNA-based NGS approaches revealed a high concordance between the two assays and were equally valuable for identifying actionable targets. These findings provide confirmatory support for the complimentary use of DNA- and RNA-based NGS approaches to most accurately identify clinically relevant translocations thereby providing more comprehensive results to help guide cancer treatment strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Translocation,Target,Concordance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Rongqin Ren<sup>1<\/sup>, Jennifer Jackson<sup>2<\/sup>, Jacob Kames<sup>2<\/sup>, David Riles<sup>2<\/sup>, Christopher Coldren<sup>1<\/sup>, Scott Wheeler<sup>1<\/sup>, Pranil Chandra<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Michelle Shiller<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>PathGroup, Nashville, TN,<sup>2<\/sup>Personal Genome Diagnostics, Baltimore, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f860b6a3-da15-4d8f-8023-0302cdfbadff","ControlNumber":"4005","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>R.

Though several clinical and genomic features predict outcomes, the &#8220;one-size-fits-all&#8221; treatment paradigm remains dominant for NDMM.<br \/>Hypothesis: By integrating clinical, genomic and therapeutic data, using artificial intelligence, an individualized risk-prediction model for NDMM (IRM) can facilitate individually-tailored therapeutic decisions.<br \/>Methods: We included 1933 patients with clinical and genomic data from 5 cohorts: MMRF CoMMpass (n=1062), MGP (n=492), Moffit AVATAR (n=177), UAMS (n=93), and MSKCC (n=109). The median follow-up was 43 months. Overall, we considered 160 clinical (e.g., age, ECOG, race), therapeutics, and genomic variables. To correct for time-dependent variables such as autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and continuous treatment, a multi-state model was designed across two phases: induction (phase 1), and post-induction (phase 2). Neural Cox Non-proportional-hazards<sup> <\/sup>(NCNPH) was used to integrate the data and build the model.<br \/>Results: Overall, the 5-year overall survival (OS) c-index for IRM was 0.73, significantly higher than all existing prognostic models: R2-ISS (0.62), ISS (0.61) and R-ISS (0.56). The overall model accuracy was significantly improved by the inclusion of 12 genomic features, including 1q21 gain\/amp, <i>TP53 <\/i>loss, t(4;14)(<i>NSD2<\/i>;<i>IGH<\/i>), complex copy number signatures, APOBEC mutational signature contribution, and del1p. Prescribed therapy emerged as a key determinant of risk, suggesting that effective combinations may have a different impact in the context of individual patient features, with the potential to significantly change clinical outcomes despite poor historical prognostication (i.e., treatment variance). Leveraging these concepts, we interrogated the clinical impact of ASCT and continuous treatment in the context of NDMM treated with bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (VRd). Integrating predicted outcomes and treatment variance for all 4 possible treatment combinations (i.e., VRd +\/- ASCT +\/- continuous treatment) we identified 3 patient groups. In the first group (n=632), patients were characterized by complex genomic features, older age, high ISS, poor outcomes and limited treatment variance, reflecting aggressive and refractory myeloma. The second group (n=571) was characterized by high treatment variance, with favorable outcomes if ASCT and continuous treatment are provided. The last group (n=730) included patients with favorable clinical and genomic profiles, achieving good outcomes, with minimal advantage from ASCT.<br \/>Conclusion: Integrating historical and emerging genomic features with clinical and therapeutic data, we developed the first individualized risk-prediction model for personally-tailored therapeutic decisions in NDMM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,Alkylating agents,Genomics,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Arjun Raj Rajanna<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Francesco Maura<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Andriy Derkach<sup>2<\/sup>, Bachisio Ziccheddu<sup>1<\/sup>, Niels Weinhold<sup>3<\/sup>, Kylee Maclachlan<sup>2<\/sup>, Benjamin Diamond<sup>1<\/sup>, Faith Davies<sup>4<\/sup>, Eileen Boyle<sup>4<\/sup>, Brian Walker<sup>5<\/sup>, Alexandra Pos<sup>3<\/sup>, Malin Hulcrantz<sup>2<\/sup>, Ariosto Silva<sup>6<\/sup>, Oliver Hampton<sup>7<\/sup>, Jamie  K.

This trial evaluated the efficacy of pembrolizumab and MEK inhibitor, binimetinib. Here we evaluated potential biomarkers in peripheral blood to predict response.<br \/>Methods: Patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC with &#8804; 3 prior lines of therapy were enrolled. Treatment includes a 2-week run-in with binimetinib followed by pembrolizumab. There were 2 dose levels (DL) with binimetinib at 45 mg at DL 0 and 30 mg at DL -1. A standard 3+3 design was used in phase I, and Simon&#8217;s two-stage Optimal design was used in phase II. Circulating tumor cells (CTC) and circulating cancer-associated macrophage-like cells (CAML) were isolated using CellSieve microfilters and immunofluorescently labeled with PD-L1 and p-ERK. Wilcoxon rank sum test and Cox regression model were used for analysis.<br \/>Results: A total of 22 patients were enrolled, with a median age of 58 years old. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed in 2 out of 4 patients in DL 0, with grade 3 ALT abnormality, flank pain, and nausea. In the next 6 patients in DL -1, there was 1 DLT with grade 3 AST\/ALT abnormality. There were 17 patients treated with DL -1 and were evaluable for response. The objective response rate (ORR) was 29.41% (95% CI: 10.31-55.9) with 1 complete response (CR) and 4 partial responses (PR). The clinical benefit rate (CBR &#8805; 24 weeks) was 35.29% (95% CI: 14.21-61.67). ORR in patients without liver metastases was 55.56% (95% CI: 21.20 - 86.30), and CBR was 66.67% (95% CI: 29.93-92.51). There was no response observed in all 5 patients with liver metastases. Baseline mean CTC count was 1.3 cells, and CAML count was 8.9 cells\/7.5 mL. Baseline PD-L1 in CAML (p 0.04) and decline in CAML size (p 0.02) after 1 cycle were significantly associated with CBR. However, baseline CTC count, CAML count (p 0.64), CAML size (p 0.46), p-ERK in CAML (p 0.23), and changes in CTC count, CAML count (p 0.83), p-ERK (p 0.07), and PD-L1 (p 0.08) in CAML were not significantly associated with responses. Using Cox regression analysis, a reduction in CAML count (p 0.02), CAML size (p 0.01), and PD-L1 in CAML (p 0.03) were associated with significant improvement in overall survival but not the reduction in p-ERK (p 0.6).<br \/>Conclusions: Pembrolizumab and binimetinib at 30 mg are safe with manageable toxicities. Promising activity was observed in patients without liver metastases. Baseline PD-L1 expression, early reduction in CAML count, size, and PD-L1 expression were significantly associated with subsequent responses, providing potential noninvasive biomarkers to predict response to this combination. Future larger clinical trials are warranted to further evaluate the efficacy of this combination.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Circulating tumor cells,MEK inhibitor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Saranya Chumsri<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Joseph J.

However, the inter-relationship between these biomarkers has not been well-investigated. Herein, we conducted a large-scale cancer genomic analysis to characterize patterns of distribution between MSI-high and TMB-high across 22 human cancer types, and identify mutated genes that may contribute to MSI-high cancers.We analyzed somatic mutation data from the Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE; n=49,496) to characterize gene mutations and patterns of distribution between MSI and TMB for each cancer. Associations between TMB and MSI were evaluated using multivariable linear regression models adjusted for age at sequencing report, sex, race, sequencing center, and histological subtype. Associations between MSI and gene mutations were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for the above mentioned covariates and TMB.Our analysis revealed that considerable differences in the prevalence of MSI-high and TMB-high by cancer types. The moderate differences were observed in cancers with the top prevalence of MSI-high\/TMB-high, such as 31.1%\/28.7% in endometrial cancer, 18.4%\/17.7% in colorectal cancer, and 17.2%\/12.2% in stomach cancer, while most other cancers showed high differences of prevalence (&#62;10%). Notably, MSI-high patients were observed to have a substantial proportion of TMB-low phenotypes ranging from 31% to 89% among these cancer types, likely indicating distinct drug responses compared to TMB-high phenotypes. Association analyses between TMB and MSI for these cancers showed the strongest associations in colorectal cancer (P=4.0x10-255) and stomach cancer (P=6.2x10-60), while marginal or no associations were observed in several cancers including head and neck cancer (P=0.08) and hepatocellular carcinoma (P=0.15). In addition, we identified several mutated genes associated with MSI-high phenotypes, including known mismatch repair genes (e.g., MSH3, POLD1, MLH1, and MSH6) and novel mutated genes (e.g., RNF43, ARID1A, ARID1B, NOTCH3, SMARCA4, KMT2C, and CREBBP), in endometrial cancer (n=32 genes), in colorectal cancer (n=29 genes) and in stomach cancer (n=18 genes), at a Bonferroni-corrected P &#60; 0.05.Our study revealed large discrepancies in prevalence between MSI-high and TMB-high in many cancer types,, highlighting the need to consider distinct or combined biomarkers for immunotherapies. Our study also identified novel mutated genes associated with MSI-high cancers, providing additional insights into MSI-high carcinogenesis and candidate genetic biomarkers to screen patients for potential immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mismatch repair,Tumor mutational burden,Cancer genetics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jungyoon Choi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jung Sun Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Kyong Hwa Park<sup>2<\/sup>, Xingyi Guo<sup>3<\/sup>, Yeul Hong Kim<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Korea University Ansan Hospital, Ansan, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Korea University Anam Hospital, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a1af7b87-55b8-4b27-9522-392e4151cd73","ControlNumber":"8153","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Furthermore, high-grade BCG unresponsive bladder cancer have limited treatment options. Such patients are offered either radical cystectomy or systemic therapy. One of the systemic therapies include immune-oncology agents, e.g., PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors. In this study, we tested the performance of Oncuria<sup>TM<\/sup> in a BCG unresponsive cohort to determine if it could predict response to a PDL1 inhibitor.<br \/>Methods: Oncuria<sup>TM<\/sup> data was evaluated in voided urine samples obtained from a prospectively collected cohort of 18 subjects who have BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with treatment of atezolizumab monotherapy or atezolizumab BCG combination (provided by Genentech, NCT02792192). The urine samples were collected prior to treatment in both arms. The Oncuria<sup>TM<\/sup> test, which measures 10 cancer-associated biomarkers was performed in an independent clinical laboratory. Predictive models were previously developed using supervised learning and cross-validation analyses. Model performance was validated using ROC curves.<br \/>Results: Pre-treatment urinary concentrations of MMP9, VEGFA, CA9, SDC1, PAI1, APOE, A1AT, ANG and MMP10 were increased in patients who developed disease recurrence. A combinatorial predictive model of treatment outcome achieved sensitivity and specificity of &#62;90%.<br \/>Conclusion: Previous pilot study found that monitoring the urinary levels of a cancer-associated biomarker panel enabled the discrimination of patients who did not respond to intravesical BCG therapy. In this study, we noted the performance of Oncuria<sup>TM<\/sup> for the prediction of systemic PDL1 inhibitor treatment response. A limitation of this study includes its small sample size. With further study, the multiplex Oncuria<sup>TM<\/sup> test may be applicable for the clinical evaluation of bladder cancer patients who have not previously responded to intravesical BCG treatment and is considering systemic immune-oncology options.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bladder cancer,Predictive biomarkers,Urine,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hideki Furuya<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kaoru Murakami<sup>1<\/sup>, Ian Pagano<sup>2<\/sup>, Runpu Chen<sup>3<\/sup>, Yijun Sun<sup>3<\/sup>, Nari Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Edward  E.

The HER2 status is routinely assessed to select patients eligible for targeted therapy with anti-HER2 drugs. HER2 positivity was restricted to cancers with a 3+ score at immunohistochemistry (IHC) and\/or gene amplification. The successful use of HER2 antibody-drug conjugates in tumors with IHC scores of 1+ (HER2 low) or 0 with incomplete and faint staining in &#8804;10% of tumor cells (HER2 ultralow) is currently changing the traditional dichotomy of HER2 testing in breast cancer.<b> <\/b>To determine HER2 expression in neoplastic tissues, a tissue microarray containing one 0.6mm tissue spot each from 7,505 tumor samples from 131 different tumor types and subtypes was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. IHC scoring included 3+, 2+, 1+, and a category &#8220;+&#8221; (faintly positive in less than 10% of tumor cells; ultralow). The cohort included 310 breast cancers for which the HER2 amplification was also assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization.<b> <\/b>Among 555 evaluable breast cancers, HER2 IHC was 3+ in 7.6%, 2+ in 3.2%, 1+ in 14.6%, &#8220;+&#8221; in 15.9% and 0 in 58.7%. The HER2 amplification rate was in 95.8% of 3+, 61.5% of 2+, 18.2% of 1+, but 0% in &#8220;+&#8221; and HER2 0 breast cancers. Among 4,912 non-breast cancers, the HER2 status was 3 in 0.6%, 2 in 0.7%, 1 in 3.3%, &#8220;+&#8221; in 2.3%, and 0 in 93.2%. In these tumors, 3+ positivity was largely restricted to gastric\/esophageal adenocarcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, ovarian cancer as well as adenocarcinomas of the lung, colon, and pancreas. A 2+ positivity was mostly seen in tumor entities that had also 3+ cases. A 1+ or &#8220;+&#8221; HER2 positivity was found in 50 of 147 analyzed non-breast cancer categories. HER2 low and ultralow (1+ or &#8220;+&#8221;) was most commonly seen in basal cell carcinoma of the skin (52.2%), clear cell carcinoma of the ovary (33.3%), urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis (33.3%), gallbladder adenocarcinoma (26.7%), muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (24.5%), prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason 4+4 (23.3%), endometrial serous carcinoma (22.7%), prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason 5+5 (19.2%), carcinosarcoma of the ovary (18.8%), renal oncocytoma (17.9%), serous carcinoma of the ovary (17.8%), gastric adenocarcinoma, intestinal type (13.2%), neuroendocrine tumor (NET) of the lung (11.1%), carcinosarcoma of the uterus (11.1%), endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary (11.1%), squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx (10.7%), parathyroid gland adenoma (10%), endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (9.7%), adenocarcinoma of the esophagus (9.5%), cholangiocarcinoma of the liver (9.3%), and pancreatic\/ampullary adenocarcinoma (8.6%).<b> <\/b>While 3+ IHC is limited to only few cancer types, there is a much broader range of tumor entities that can show HER2 low and ultralow expression.

To address this technical challenge, we utilized primary breast luminal epithelial cells propagated from healthy donors of different genetic ancestry and their hTERT-immortalized counterparts to identify functional gene expression changes associated with immortalization. We identified elevated expression of TONSL (Tonsoku Like, DNA Repair Protein) as one of the earliest events during immortalization. TONSL is located on chromosome 8q24.3 and amplified in ~20% of breast cancers with significantly higher amplification in metastatic tumors. TONSL forms a complex with FACT and MMS22L1 to modulate multiple cellular pathways including DNA replication, repair through homologous recombination (HR) and functions as a post replicative histone\/chromatin reader. TONSL alone immortalized primary breast epithelial cells and increased telomerase activity. While TONSL overexpression alone was insufficient for neoplastic transformation, TONSL-immortalized primary cells modified to overexpress defined oncogenes generated estrogen receptor-positive adenocarcinomas in NSG mice. Analysis of breast tumor microarray with ~500 tumors revealed poor overall and progression free survival of patients with TONSL-overexpressing tumors. TONSL increased chromatin accessibility to pro-oncogenic transcription factors including NF-&#954;B and limited access to the tumor suppressor p53. Most importantly, TONSL overexpression resulted in significant changes in the expression of genes associated with DNA repair hubs, including upregulation of several genes in HR and Fanconi Anemia pathways. Consistent with the effects of TONSL on HR-associated genes, TONSL overexpressing primary cells exhibited upregulated DNA repair via HR. Moreover, TONSL was an essential gene for growth of TONSL-amplified breast cancer cell lines <i>in vivo<\/i>. Breast cancer cell lines with TONSL\/chr8q24.3 amplification were sensitive to TONSL-FACT complex inhibitor CBL0137, both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. To our knowledge, TONSL is the only gene other than telomerase with immortalizing function and represents a new therapeutic target for breast cancer with chr8q24.3 amplification.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer initiating cells,Cancer markers,DNA double-strand break repair genes,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Aditi  S.

However, this phenomenon has not yet been demonstrated with antibody-drug conjugates. Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is a novel ADC composed of an anti-Trop2 monoclonal antibody, a stable tetrapeptide-based cleavable linker, and a topoisomerase-I inhibitor payload (Bardia, Annals of Onc 2021). Early phase studies have demonstrated significant activity in heavily pretreated patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Stomatitis was a common treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) observed in clinical trials. We conducted a study to evaluate the association between incidence of stomatitis and treatment response with Dato-DXd and evaluate the impact of steroid mouthwash. We hypothesized that presence and grade of mucositis would correlate with observed treatment efficacy.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We included all patients treated at one academic institution (Massachusetts General Hospital) with Dato-DXd. Stomatitis was assessed by NCI-CTCAE V5.0. Objective Response Rate (ORR) was assessed by RECIST criteria with independent radiology review. Use of mouthwash was evaluated by secondary review and categorized as primary or secondary prophylaxis. A time-to-event analysis was performed to evaluate the time to onset of stomatitis.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> 60 patients, including 19 with MBC and 41 with NSCLC, were treated with Dato-DXd between June 2018-September 2022. The median age of patients was 64 and 41\/60 patients were female. The median time to onset of mucositis was 14 days (95% CI 12-42 days). There was no significant difference in incidence of stomatitis between the MBC and NSCLC cohorts. Compared to patients who had progressive disease (PD), patients who had a partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) were 11 times more likely to have stomatitis (OR 11.0, 95% CI 3.61-44.01, p&#60;0.001). Later in the trial (January 2020 onward), 28 patients received primary steroid prophylaxis - excluding these patients, those who were found to have PR\/SD were 8.8 times more likely to develop stomatitis compared to patients who had PD (OR 8.8, 95% CI 1.5-73.3, p=0.023).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The development of stomatitis may be associated with higher likelihood of therapeutic efficacy. Given that these findings are a hypothesis-generating post-hoc exploratory analysis from a single institution, this requires validation in larger studies before drawing strong conclusions and impacting clinical decision making. Further research is also needed evaluate the relationship between TEAEs and therapeutic efficacy with other ADCs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Trop-2,Biomarkers,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Rachel  O.

Despite successes of adjuvant endocrine therapies in treating the most common subtype of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) BC, de novo and emergent resistance to these therapies, i.e., endocrine resistance, remains a significant concern with patients experiencing recurrences during and after adjuvant treatment. We report here unique patterns of expression (UPE) of N-myristoyltransferase 1 (NMT1) protein that are prognostic and predictive markers for HR+ BC. We have discovered that the expression and localization of NMT1 are predictive markers for the endocrine therapy response in HR+ BC. The data from many observational studies suggest that after five years of adjuvant endocrine treatment, the likelihood of distant recurrence continues for the subsequent twenty years. We have developed simple immunohistochemical (IHC)-based tests that could become part of routine first line prognostic and predictive tests and have the potential to be incorporated as necessary tests in the panel of BC tests for designing treatment regimens of BC.<br \/><u>Methods:<\/u> Expression patterns of NMT1 were determined using IHC analyses on formalin fixed paraffin embedded primary tumor samples from treatment na&#239;ve BC patients. The tumor tissues in duplicates were stained with NMT1 monoclonal\/polyclonal antibodies on an autostainer (Leica Bond). Stained slides were scored in a blinded manner to outcomes and scored with an \"H\" index representing the intensity and percent positive cells within each section. The relationship of UPE was correlated with clinical outcomes of RFS (RFS&#8201;=&#8201;endpoint recurrence and\/or death due to BC) and OS (OS&#8201;=&#8201;endpoint death due to breast cancer).<br \/><u>Results:<\/u> The final cohort was composed of 448 BC cases of primary HR+&#8201;tumors from patients who received adjuvant tamoxifen therapy after surgery. UPE2 (defined by&#8201;&#62;&#8201;median H score 100) was significantly associated with better clinical outcomes represented by both RFS (HR&#8201;=&#8201;0.70, <i>P<\/i>&#8201;=&#8201;0.0304, 95% CI 0.510 to 0.97, n&#8201;=&#8201;440) and OS (HR&#8201;=&#8201;0.71, <i>P<\/i>&#8201;=&#8201;0.0306, 95% CI 0.530 to 0.97, n&#8201;=&#8201;440), whereas UPE4 strongly predicted worse treatment response for both RFS (HR= 1.49, P = 0.0014, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.04, n=440) and OS (HR = 1.54, P = 0.0055, 95% CI = 1.54 to 2.08, n=440).<br \/><u>Conclusions:<\/u> We observed that the expression and localization patterns of NMT1 constitute four unique patterns of expression signatures (UPE:1-4) and serve as prognostic and potentially predictive markers for HR+ BC. This assay provides a novel method to stratify cancers that may better enable endocrine treatment and duration optimization in the adjuvant setting for HR+ breast cancer. Moreover, in distinction to genomic assays, fewer logistic and financial barriers to implementation would exist for the UPE:1-4 IHC assay in resource-poor settings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Prognostic markers,Endocrine resistance,Predictive biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Danira Jaksic<sup>1<\/sup>, Amandeep Kaur<sup>1<\/sup>, Dean Reddick<sup>1<\/sup>, David David Datzkiw<sup>1<\/sup>, Shailly Varma Shrivastav<sup>2<\/sup>, Vijayakrishna Gadi<sup>3<\/sup>, Leigh Murphy<sup>4<\/sup>, <b>Anuraag Shrivastav<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>The University of Winnipeg, Winnipeg, MB, Canada,<sup>2<\/sup>Oncodrex Inc, Winnipeg, MB, Canada,<sup>3<\/sup>University of Illinois Cancer Center, Chicago, IL,<sup>4<\/sup>CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bf7aff02-5110-4a4b-ab36-52c80c923468","ControlNumber":"5426","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

However, a consistent and reproducible method for isolating viable single cells and generating high quality single cell data from needle biopsy cores has been challenging to develop.<b> <\/b>Based on our experience isolating single cells from a large number of surgical tumor tissues, we set out to optimize a dissociation and processing protocol to generate viable single cell suspensions in adequate quantity for scRNA-seq from needle biopsy cores. A total of 17 de-identified 18-gauge needle biopsy samples were collected in collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center investigators. Samples were from liver, lymph node, pelvis, abdominal, neck, and lung tissues and included matched pre- and post-treatment samples. Patient biopsies were kept in RPMI medium on ice and transferred to EMPIRI (time to capture ranged from 3 to 6.5 hours after biopsy collection). Samples were dissociated using mechanical and enzymatic methods to achieve a single cell suspension. Cells were washed and viability and cell counts were verified before capture via 10x Chromium Connect. Captured cells were processed through the 10x Genomics Chromium Next GEM Single Cell workflow before sequencing on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer. Raw sequencing data were processed through EMPIRI&#8217;s computational pipeline that includes QC steps, doublet removal, and Seurat and other downstream analyses. Recovery of viable cells from individual 18-gauge biopsy cores ranged from 2,000-300,000 cells per core, depending on the tissue type and cellularity. Cell viability was strictly monitored and was maintained above 80% for 16 of 17 samples (most samples &#62;90%). Cell counts after sequencing and pipeline analysis averaged 6,466 cells per sample. The median number of UMI counts per cell was 5,580, and an average of 1,699 genes were identified per cell. Average sequencing saturation was 73%. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of integrating scRNA-seq analysis into clinical trials or clinical studies to obtain rapid insights into on-target drug effects and anticipated cellular responses to therapies, including immunotherapies, within 3 weeks of biopsy collection.<b> <\/b>We have established a method for isolating high quality single cells for scRNA-seq from tissue biopsy core, as small as a single 18-gauge needle core. We tested our protocol on 17 human samples and showed successful isolation of highly viable cells from lung, lymph node, pelvis, abdominal, neck, and lung tissues. We were able to generate scRNA-seq data sets from all samples for analysis.<br \/><b>Acknowledgements:<\/b> We thank our MDACC collaborators, particularly Drs.

CPK elevation was the most common AE during Au treatment which may pose safety concerns. To evaluate the relationship between CPK elevation and Au efficacy, we performed a post-hoc analysis of AENEAS.<br \/>Methods: AENEAS is a double-blind, randomized controlled phase III trial. Untreated advanced NSCLC pts with EGFR sensitizing mutations were assigned 1:1 to receive Au (110 mg QD) or G (250 mg QD). The primary endpoint was PFS. Secondary endpoints included ORR, DCR, DoR and DepOR. Data cutoff: Aug 1, 2021.<br \/>Results: 37.9% (81\/214) of pts receiving Au had CPK elevation, among whom the mPFS was 26.3 mos and was significantly longer (HR=0.45; 95% CI: 0.31-0.67; P&#60;.0001) than that of the CPK-normal pts (133\/214) at 13.9 mos. PFS benefits remained consistent across all prespecified subgroups. Also for all the secondary endpoints, CPK-elevated pts demonstrated significant benefits over CPK-normal pts (TABLE). Multivariable regression analysis revealed that CPK elevation was an independent predictor of prolonged PFS for pts receiving Au, with 54% reduced risk of progression or death for CPK-elevated pts compared with CPK-normal pts (HR=0.46; 95%CI: 0.31-0.68; P=.0001). Au demonstrated PFS benefits over G in both CPK-elevated pts (HR=0.40; 95% CI: 0.21-0.79; P=.0059) and CPK-normal pts (HR=0.63; 95% CI: 0.48-0.83; P=.0010), and the benefit was magnified in CPK-elevated pts. Further supported by post-hoc analysis of a phase 1\/2 study (NCT02981108), PFS was also significantly prolonged in CPK-elevated pts receiving second or later line Au (17.7 vs 10.9 mos; HR=0.63; 95% CI: 0.46-0.87; P=.0049).<br \/>Conclusion: Our study first revealed the predictive value of CPK elevation on improved treatment response of Au, which is of great significance to help guide medical care.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{F1EDED6B-E295-42EA-BBFE-41BBF14B2C1D}\"><caption>Summary of Endpoints<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Elevated CPK<\/b><b>(N=81)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Normal CPK<\/b><b>(N=133)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\"><b>PFS, months<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Median (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">26.3 (20.7-NA)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13.9 (12.4-19.8)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">HR (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">0.45 (0.31-0.67)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">P-value<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">&lt;0.0001<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">12-months PFS rate (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">84.9 (74.9-91.1)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">59.4 (50.2-67.5)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">24-months PFS rate (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">54.3 (42.4-64.7)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">30.1 (21.9-38.8)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\"><b>DoR, months<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Median (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">23.5 (18.1-NA)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">15.2 (10.2-19.2)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">HR (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">0.51 (0.33-0.79)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">P-value<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">0.0024<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">12-months DoR rate (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">77.7 (65.7-85.9)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">55.8 (44.3-65.9)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">24-months DoR rate (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">46.9 (33.7-59.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">31.0 (20.9-41.6)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>ORR (95% CI), %<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">87.7 (78.5-93.9)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">66.9 (58.2-74.8)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">OR (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">3.54 (1.64-7.64)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">P-value<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">0.0013<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>DCR (95% CI), %<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">98.8 (93.3-100.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">89.5 (83.0-94.1)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">OR (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">9.59 (1.22-75.54)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">P-value<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">0.0318<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\"><b>DepOR, %<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Mean (Std)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-50.5 (17.4)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-42.0 (24.1)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Range<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-100.0-3.6<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">-100.0-50.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">P-value<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">0.0105<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,aumolertinib,treatment reponse predictor,creatine phosphokinase,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Shun Lu<sup>1<\/sup>, Chuan Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Hong Jian<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaorong Dong<sup>3<\/sup>, Jianhua Chen<sup>4<\/sup>, Gongyan Chen<sup>5<\/sup>, Yuping Sun<sup>6<\/sup>, Yinghua Ji<sup>7<\/sup>, <b>Jiawei Wei<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, Si Sun<sup>2<\/sup>, Zhenzhong Su<sup>2<\/sup>, Qiu Sun<sup>2<\/sup>, Hongying Wei<sup>2<\/sup>, Qiong Wu<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Medical Oncology, Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University, Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group Co.

PD-L1 can combine with its receptor (PD-1) to reduce the proliferation of PD-1-positive cells and induce apoptosis. Therefore, PD-L1 was employed as a prognostic marker and a target for anti-cancer immunotherapy in blocking the PD-1 and PD-L1 checkpoints. PD-L1 is highly expressed in various malignancies, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). HNSCC is the sixth most common cancer worldwide, with high incidence and mortality rates in China. Although PD-L1 expression has been widely investigated, the PD-L1 expression status in Chinese HNSCC patients (pts) is largely unrevealed. The primary objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of PD-L1 expression with the Combined Positive Score (CPS) &#8805;20 in Chinese pts with recurrent or metastatic (R\/M) HNSCC. The secondary objectives were to determine the prevalence of CPS&#8805;1 in pts with R\/M HNSCC and to study the difference in the demographic characteristics, clinicopathological parameters, treatment status, and other available biomarkers between the PD-L1 CPS&#8805;20 group and the PD-L1 CPS&#60;20 group. This study was a multi-center retrospective analysis of data from six centers in China from August 9, 2021, to February 28, 2022. Pts with histologically\/cytologically confirmed diagnoses of R\/M HNSCC were included. PD-L1 expression was assessed by IHC using the 22C3 PharmDx assay (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and was determined using a CPS. The Chi-square test, Fisher&#8217;s exact test, or Wilcoxon rank sum test would be used to compare the prevalence of these variables among pts between the PD-L1 CPS&#8805;20 group and the PD-L1 CPS&#60;20 group. Out of 406 enrolled pts with R\/M HNSCC, 402 testing pts were included in the final analysis. For all testing R\/M HNSCC pts, 168 pts (41.8% [95% CI 36.92-46.78]) had PD-L1 expression with CPS &#8805;20. In addition, 337 pts (83.8% [95% CI 79.86-87.29]) had PD-L1 expression (CPS&#8805;1). For the testing pts, there were statistically significant differences in variables of gender (P &#60; 0.001), smoking habit (P = 0.0138 for non-smokers versus current smokers), and primary tumor site (P &#60; 0.001 for hypopharynx versus oral cavity and P = 0.0304 for larynx versus oral cavity) between the PD-L1 CPS&#8805;20 group and the PD-L1 CPS&#60;20 group. In summary, in Chinese R\/M HNSCC pts, most pts (83.8%) had PD-L1 expression, and two-fifths (41.8%) had PD-L1 expression with CPS &#8805;20. Prevalence of PD-L1 among Chinese pts with R\/M HNSCC was consistent with that reported in the global KEYNOTE-048 study. PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with gender, smoking history and primary tumor site. Our findings of the variables related to the PD-L1 expression levels can supply adjuvant evidence for clinical practice and are a solid basis for future research on immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,PD-L1,Immunotherapy,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Haizhen Lu<sup>1<\/sup>, Dong Kuang<sup>2<\/sup>, Lili Jiang<sup>3<\/sup>, Jingping Yun<sup>4<\/sup>, Qingxin Xia<sup>5<\/sup>, Jian Wang<sup>6<\/sup>, Pei Duan<sup>2<\/sup>, Ping Zhou<sup>3<\/sup>, Shengbing Zang<sup>4<\/sup>, Yiping Jin<sup>5<\/sup>, Xiangnan Jiang<sup>6<\/sup>, Jielin Li<sup>7<\/sup>, Wenmin Tang<sup>7<\/sup>, Jiansong Zhou<sup>7<\/sup>, Jihua Chen<sup>7<\/sup>, <b>Jianming Ying<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>National Cancer Center\/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer\/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Wuhan, China,<sup>3<\/sup>West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China,<sup>4<\/sup>Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China,<sup>5<\/sup>Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China,<sup>6<\/sup>Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China,<sup>7<\/sup>MSD China, Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"055fb738-0371-4a17-9f82-6bfba06c61fe","ControlNumber":"4266","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

Single agent immunotherapy or combined immunotherapy have become the standard of care in advanced HCC. Recently, the combination of durvalumab (dur) plus a single dose of 300 mg tremelimumab (trem) (STRIDE regimen) have received FDA approval based on results from the HIMALAYA trial. However, immune responses have not been studied in detail. We tested the combination of 4x 75 mg trem plus dur and locoregional therapies in HCC at and conducted correlative studies.<br \/>Methods: We enrolled 28 patients with biopsy proven advanced HCC in an open-labeled phase 2 trial using dur and trem combined with ablative therapies (NCT02821754). Patients received four doses of 75mg trem every 4 weeks and 1500mg dur every 4 weeks until progression. Patients underwent an interventional radiologic procedure (RFA\/TACE) on day 36. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and serum from patients enrolled were collected at baseline and after 1 cycle (day 28). PBMC was analyzed by multicolor spectral cytometry using a 17 antibody pan immune cell panel and a 25 antibody T cell panel. Serum samples from patients were collected at baseline and on day 28. Serum samples were analyzed with a 34-plex cytokine\/chemokine array. Mice with orthotopically injected HCC (RIL-175 and Hep55.1C) were treated with anti-PD-L1 plus anti-CTLA4 and followed for tumor responses. Hepatic lymphocytes, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and splenocytes were analyzed by spectral cytometry from mice treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.<br \/>Results: 28 patients with advanced HCC were enrolled in this study. The best clinical response for treatment was the following, partial response (PR, n=5), stable disease (SD, n=12), progressive disease (PD, n=8), and not evaluable (n=3). Median PFS and OS were 4.5 and 20.8 months respectively. Patient PBMC analysis demonstrated an increase of regulatory T cells 1.65 times from baseline after 28 days in all patients. The frequency of Tbet<sup>+<\/sup>CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells showed a non-significant increase in patients demonstrating a PR. Serum cytokine analysis revealed the levels of IL-18, IL-10, CCL-2, and VEGF-a increased in responders after treatment. in contrast, an increase of IL-6 and TNF-alpha after treatment was found only in patients with PD. In animal experiments, the size of liver tumors treated with anti-PDL1 and anti-CTLA4 were significantly smaller than that with isotype controls. The lymphocytes in the adjacent livers and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were analyzed. PD1<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and Tbet<sup>+<\/sup>CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the liver and TILs increased with combination treatment.<br \/>Conclusion: Anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA4 combination therapy have an anti-tumor effect on HCC.

In prior work using computational image analysis of multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF), we have shown the positive impact of CD68+ PD-L1+ macrophages in combination with CD8+ T cells in predicting long-term OS benefit in NSCLC patients treated with durvalumab (anti-PD-L1), highlighting the impact of the myeloid compartment on IO responses. In part, using proteomics mass spectrometry we sought to investigate further the functional impact of myeloid cells on the IO response and in particular, suppressive (M2) tumor associated macrophages (TAMs).<br \/>Methods: Pre-treatment tumor samples from 66 patients with advanced NSCLC patients enrolled in durvalumab nonrandomized phase 1\/2 trial (10 mg\/kg Q2W, CP1108\/NCT01693562) were processed for global and targeted proteomics. A pathologist determined the tumor area and a single FFPE tumor tissue section was used for laser-capture macrodissection and protein extraction followed by mass spectrometry analysis using label-free, data-independent and parallel reaction monitoring.<br \/>Results: Among the immune associated proteins detected by proteomics mass spectrometry, we evaluated CD163 protein expression, a well-described marker of suppressive (M2) macrophages, and its impact on durvalumab clinical outcomes, alone and in relationship with PD-L1 and immune infiltration. While proteomics-based biomarker evaluable population (BEP) shows shorter median (m) OS compared to intended to treat population, we validated that high expression of PD-L1 as measured by IHC or proteomics associates with greater OS benefit as expected when treating with durvalumab. Building on this, the evaluation of protein associated with suppressive M2 macrophages, revealed that approximately 30% of NSCLC patients with high CD163 protein expression show poor OS benefit (5 months mOS) following durvalumab treatment. In contrast, patients with PD-L1 TC &#8805;50% and low CD163 expression derive greater OS benefit (13.4 months mOS) than those with high CD163 expression (5 months mOS) or with PD-L1 TC &#60;50% regardless of level of CD163 expression (4.1-7.4 months mOS). Moreover, patients with poorer outcome have significantly higher baseline CD163 protein expression as a proportion of total CD45 protein expression.<br \/>Conclusion: This analysis further confirms the importance of myeloid cell function within the tumor microenvironment (TME) in determining the outcome to T cell-directed IO therapy and highlights the utility of proteomics mass spectrometry in assessing more broadly and quantitatively the TME complementing findings based on RNAseq and IHC\/mIF assays.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Macrophages,Anti-PD-L1,CD163,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anna Margaret Hansen<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Vivian Ying Wang<sup><\/sup>, Andrew Chambers<sup><\/sup>, David Chain<sup><\/sup>, Jaime Rodriguez Canales<sup><\/sup>, Jorge Blando<sup><\/sup>, Steve Sweet<sup><\/sup>, Zachary  A.

In order to detect aberrant HSC differentiation in blood samples sensitively and accurately, we explored the use of scRNA-seq of CD34-enriched cells from peripheral blood in identifying differentiation trajectories that are abnormal in patient samples versus expected normal development.<br \/>A total of 685,000 CD34-enriched PBMCs from 93 samples were analyzed using 10X 3&#8217; v3 scRNA-seq library preparation. For increased efficiency, the samples were multiplexed in groups of 5 individuals and were later identified based on individual natural genetic variation using a custom genotyping assay or low-pass WGS. We then sequenced these 24 libraries on a UG100 sequencer to yield an average of 20,000 reads per cell. Six of these libraries were also sequenced on a NovaSeq. Comparison between scRNA profiles generated on the two different sequencers yielded highly similar results, including a similar ability to demultiplex the patient samples using genetic markers, accurately quantify gene modules and determine cell populations.To analyze the scRNA data, we used a novel computational framework, Metacell, to reconstruct metacell modules for both healthy and disease samples allowing us to find variability in the differentiation process between the disease samples and the normal baseline state. Two patients with MDS which had transformed to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) demonstrated unique and distinct metacell clusters that were significantly separate from normal HSPC differentiation patterns, demonstrating distinct clusters with elevated levels of BCL2 which is an existing therapy target in secondary AML. Our results demonstrate that scRNA-seq analysis of peripheral blood HSPCs samples can be used to detect aberrations in HSC development in MDS patients and serve as a prognostic tool for stratification of patients with aggressive disease and drug response. Given the cost-efficiency of the entire process, we believe this is one of the first examples of the potential practical utility of single-cell analysis in a clinical setting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,CD34,Bone marrow,Cancer diagnostics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Eti Meiri<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nili Saar-Furer<sup>2<\/sup>, Nimrod Rappoport<sup>2<\/sup>, Sarah Pollock<sup>1<\/sup>, Gila Lithwick-Yanai<sup>1<\/sup>, Zohar Shipony<sup>1<\/sup>, Nika Iremadze<sup>1<\/sup>, Doron Lipson<sup>1<\/sup>, Amos Tanay<sup>2<\/sup>, Liran Shlush<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Ultima Genomics, Newark, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a6ef1fd1-f33e-4a6b-8f64-99bd9ca671f2","ControlNumber":"6329","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;E.

However, a high proportion of patients will present disease progression due to the resistance of cancer cells to CDK4\/6 inhibitors. Loss of retinoblastoma function, dysregulation of several signaling pathways and overexpression of CDK6, CDK7 and cyclin E have been described as main actors in the development of resistance to CDK4\/6 inhibitors. Despite these findings on the role of new emerging biomarkers, we wondered if the clinicopathological characteristics could be useful to identify the patients that will respond to CDK4\/6 inhibitors by the analysis of a retrospective case series of patients with HR+ mBC treated with hormone therapy plus CDK4\/6 inhibitors (ribociclib, palbociclib, abemaciclib) at IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori (IRST) \"Dino Amadori\" (Meldola, Italy). 177 mBC patients 66 of whom were treated with CD4\/6 inhibitors plus letrozole and 111 treated with CDK4\/6 inhibitors and fulvestrant were enrolled in the study. The median age was 63 years (range 38-92), of whom 103 younger than 65 years. 152 were in postmenopausal status. Among the clinical characteristics, neutropenia was developed in 80 patients. ki67 was low (&#60;20%) in 85 patients. 21 (23.3%) patients had bone metastases, 36 visceral metastases (23.3%) and 33 (36.7%) in other organs. The multivariable Cox PH model showed that having received a prior adjuvant treatment and the number of metastases were the only factors associated with the progression-free survival (PFS). Furthermore, when introducing the presence of neutropenia as a potential predictor of PFS in the Cox PH model, it resulted to be a risk predictor of progression. To better describe the mechanism linking PFS and neutropenia a multistate model was developed. Low body surface area and older age were associated with an increased risk of developing neutropenia. High Ki67, the presence of visceral metastases and the absence of a prior adjuvant chemotherapy were prognostic factors of progression\/death. As expected, among neutropenic patients, those with multiple previous lines of treatment were at higher risk of disease progression\/death. Finally, the neutropenia status was associated with a more than double risk of progression\/death with respect to patients without neutropenia (HR=2.311; p=0.025). Given that we identified a set of factors associated with the probability to develop neutropenia and considering that neutropenia itself is associated with an increased risk of progression, these baseline characteristics should be taken into account in order to reduce the occurrence of both neutropenia and disease progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,Hormone-related cancer,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sara Bravaccini<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Andrea Roncadori<sup><\/sup>, William Balzi<sup><\/sup>, Giovanni Martinelli<sup><\/sup>, Maria Teresa Montella<sup><\/sup>, Michela Palleschi<sup><\/sup>, Roberta Maltoni<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori (IRST) “Dino Amadori”, Meldola, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e9872279-405c-4a43-88b8-9b47c62e3178","ControlNumber":"4433","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Therapeutic approaches to target cancers harboring <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplification are being developed (e.g. PKMYT1, WEE1, and CDK2 inhibitors). In this study, we report the genomic landscape and architecture of <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplifications using a combination of whole-exome (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) approaches. WES data from 361 ovarian and 580 uterine cancers was retrieved from TCGA. WGS data from 113 ovarian and 51 uterine cancers was retrieved from PCAWG. For both WES and WGS, amplification was defined as CN minus ploidy (CN-ploidy) &#62;= 4. <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplification was detected in up to 21.2% of ovarian and 13.7% of uterine cancers from both methods. A review of the co-alteration landscape using WES revealed that <i>TP53<\/i> alterations frequently co-occurred with <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplifications in both ovarian and uterine cancers (ovarian: 95.8% vs 87.6%, OR = 3.24, p=0.1; uterine: 89.6% vs 36.0%, OR = 15.2, p =2.14e-13) and <i>BRCA1<\/i> alterations were mutually exclusive with <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplifications in ovarian cancer (2.1% vs 17.9%, OR=0.2, p = 3.1e-3). In addition, alterations in <i>ARID1A<\/i> (0% vs 40.5%, OR = 0, p = 1.3e-10) and <i>PTEN<\/i> (4.2% vs 60.1%, OR = 0.03, p =2.7e-15) were mutually exclusive with <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplifications in uterine cancer. The number of <i>CCNE1<\/i> copies ranged widely, with median CN-ploidy values of 9.3 (range: 4.0 -35.0) in ovarian and 7.7 (range: 4.0 -40.3) in uterine cancers from the WES cohort, and 7.4 (range: 4.1 -34.3) in ovarian and 11.0 (range: 4.6 - 81.9) in uterine cancers from WGS. We also observed a broad range of <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplicon sizes, from highly focal to chromosome arm-level amplifications. WGS data showed frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 19 arms and an enrichment of fold-back inversions proximal to the <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplicon implicating breakage-fusion-bridge in formation of <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplicons. Whole genome duplication (WGD) was detected significantly more frequently in ovarian and uterine cancers with <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplification than the wild-type group (ovarian: 90.9% vs 48.3%, p = 6.4e-10; uterine: 78.7% vs 21.9%, p = 7.1e-15). As compared to <i>CCNE1<\/i> wild-type cancers, <i>CCNE1<\/i>-amplified cancers were found to display an enrichment for certain structural variant signatures: RS1, dominated by 100Kb-1Mb duplications (median = 30, p=0.08); RS2, dominated by translocations (median = 16, p=0.001); and RS7, dominated by 100Kb-1Mb deletions (median=23, p=0.0002). In conclusion, <i>CCNE1<\/i>-amplified ovarian and uterine cancers are enriched for <i>TP53<\/i> alterations and display a high degree of genome instability manifested as WGD and characteristic structural variants. Fold-back inversions and LOH were frequently observed at the <i>CCNE1<\/i> locus in tumors with <i>CCNE1<\/i> amplification, suggesting a potential breakage-fusion-bridge mechanism in the genesis of this amplicon.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cyclin E,Ovarian cancer,Uterine carcinosarcoma,Genomic instability,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sunantha Sethuraman<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Dominik Glodzik<sup>1<\/sup>, Pier Selenica<sup>2<\/sup>, Adrienne Johnson<sup>1<\/sup>, Jorge  S.

Due to the lack of targeted therapies for LUSC, the prognosis is poor and chemotherapy still plays a full role in the treatment of LUSC patients currently. However, a significant proportion of patients showed a bad response to chemotherapy. The development of predictive biomarkers is urgent. We aimed to identify new chemotherapy biomarkers based on genomic alterations.<br \/>Methods: We retrospectively analyzed DNA sequencing data of 317 LUSC patients (pts) at West China hospital. We collected the clinical features and progression-free survival (PFS) of 35 pts with chemotherapy only. Pts were assigned to different subgroups based on genomic alterations using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering. Based on the characteristics of the cluster, we then explored clear gene signatures to predict the prognosis of chemotherapy. The clinical information and sequencing data of TCGA LUSC with chemotherapy were used to validate the prognostic value of the signature.<br \/>Results: The 317 LUSC pts were grouped into 4 clusters characterized by different genomic alterations. Cluster 1 (C1) had 129 pts and was characterized by <i>TP53<\/i> alterations. There were 116 pts in cluster 2 (C2) characterized by <i>PIK3CA<\/i> amplification (amp). Cluster 3 (C3) had 33 pts and was characterized by gene amp of <i>CCND1<\/i>, <i>FGF3<\/i>, <i>FGF4<\/i>, and <i>FGF19<\/i>. Cluster 4 (C4) was characterized by gene amp of <i>FGFR1<\/i>, <i>KDR<\/i>, <i>KIT<\/i>, and PDGFRA. The 35 pts treated with chemotherapy only were also classified into 4 clusters. C1 was associated with the shortest PFS (hazard ratio (HR), 2.87; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.15-7.13; p = 0.018) independently of the clinical stage, but C2, C3, and C4 showed no significant difference. In addition, we also found that pts with <i>TP53<\/i> loss of function (LOF) alteration had significantly shorter PFS than those without<br \/><i>TP53<\/i> LOF (wildtype or not LOF, p = 0.029). So we further modified the clustering by <i>TP53<\/i> alteration from C1 and gene amp from C2, C3, and C4. Therefore, 35 pts were then grouped into 3 subtypes based on <i>TP53<\/i> LOF and gene amp characteristics, and the PFS was significantly different. Pts (n = 8, 23%) with at least one amp of 9 genes (<i>PIK3CA, CCND1, FGF3, FGF4, FGF19, FGFR1, KDR, KIT,<\/i> and <i>PDGFRA<\/i>) but no <i>TP53<\/i> LOF had the longest PFS (HR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02-0.66; p = 0.011). Pts (n = 6) with <i>TP53<\/i> LOF but no 9-gene amp had poor survival compared with pts in other subtypes. This gene signature was validated in TCGA pts. The signature of 9-gene amp without TP53 LOF also indicated the best PFS and <i>TP53<\/i> LOF without 9-gene amp indicated the worst PFS (p = 0.081).<br \/>Conclusion: We develop a biomarker signature that consists of 9-gene amp and <i>TP53<\/i> LOF to indicate the prognosis of chemotherapy. Our results suggest that 9-gene amp without <i>TP53<\/i> LOF in LUSC is a favorable prognostic marker for patients taking chemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene expression patterns,Lung squamous cell carcinoma ,Chemotherapy ,Predictive biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yuan Tang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yuli Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Ting Hou<sup>2<\/sup>, Lili Jiang<sup>1<\/sup>, Hongjie Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Chunxiao Pan<sup>2<\/sup>, Weiya Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Li Qiu<sup>1<\/sup>, Yajing Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Guiping Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Ke Zheng<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Pathology, West China Hospital, Chengdu, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Burning Rock Biotech, Guangzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d5090cf1-1b3b-4f8a-aef4-9d52a50daba8","ControlNumber":"4371","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

This study aimed to investigate whether integrating immunological and tumor-intrinsic factors could identify patients who may be candidates for de-escalation of radiotherapy (RT).Experimental<br \/>Design: The practice-changing SweBCG91RT trial included 1178 patients with stage I-IIA breast cancer, randomized to breast-conserving surgery with or without adjuvant RT with sparse use of systemic therapy (95% without systemic therapy) and followed for a median time of 15.2 years. We developed two gene expression models to capture immunological activity and immunomodulatory tumor-intrinsic qualities, respectively. We then analyzed if combining these two variables could identify a subgroup where RT de-escalation is feasible.<br \/>Results: The immunomodulatory model correlated with proliferation and was named Proliferative Index. The immunological model was enriched for T cell signatures and was named Immunescore. Increased Proliferative Index predicted an increased prognostic benefit from Immunescore (p<sub>interaction<\/sub>=0.01). Combining the two models stratified patients who may be recommended an escalated RT (RT boost) by RT benefit and prognosis. Patients with a low predicted risk benefited from standard RT (HR: 0.28, CI 95% 0.09-0.85, p=0.025) and had a 5.4% 10-year incidence of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) after radiation. In contrast, the group with a high predicted risk, characterized by rapidly proliferating tumors without an immune infiltrate, had a clinically meaningful high 10-year incidence of IBTR despite RT treatment (19.5% (CI 95% 12.2-30.3)).<br \/>Conclusions: Integrating tumor-intrinsic and immunological factors may identify immunogenic tumors in early-stage breast cancer populations and identify patients for whom de-escalated RT may be appropriate.

A challenge in developing robust immunogenicity prediction models is limited availability of sequencing-associated immunogenicity data for evaluating methods due to the complexity of generating such datasets. We propose a novel approach to optimize prediction models of immunogenic neoantigens using a meta-analysis framework based on multiple ICB cohorts.<br \/>Methods: To build on the 110 mono-allelic immunopeptidomics-derived SHERPA&#174; MHC binding prediction framework, we engineered T-cell recognition features on two datasets: peptide-centric data aggregated by Schmidt et al. and patient-specific exome and transcriptome sequencing data from the TESLA consortium. We developed two-tiered models based on the feature landscapes of both datasets to predict peptide-MHC (pMHC) immunogenicity, incorporating features with significant performance gains. We systematically re-processed publicly available DNA and RNA sequencing data from over 500 ICB treated patients spanning 12 different cohorts across five different cancer types with a harmonized bioinformatics pipeline. We then evaluated the performance of each model consisting of a unique combination of immunogenic features across the ICB training (N=7) and validation (N=5) cohorts using a meta-analysis framework.<br \/>Results: We evaluated iterations of SHERPA-Immunogenicity (SI) models using the Schmidt et al. and TESLA datasets, resulting in a range of performance metrics (area under the precision recall curves of 0.74-0.84 and positive predictive values of 0.32-0.54). After aggregating pMHC predictions into patient-specific scores based on the most immunogenic peptide present (SHERPA-Immunogenicity Maximum - SIM) or the quantity of immunogenic peptides identified (SHERPA-Immunogenicity Burden - SIB), we observed that responders had higher SIM and SIB scores compared to non-responders across the melanoma training cohorts. We found SIM scores outperformed SIB scores, suggesting the degree of epitope immunogenicity may be a critical factor in predicting response. The model with the most significant meta p-value for ICB response in melanoma cohorts (OR=2.43, p=0.006) also predicted overall survival in 3\/5 melanoma cohorts (p&#38;lt0.05).<br \/>Conclusions: We developed a novel framework to predict neoantigen immunogenicity utilizing meta-analysis of ICB cohorts to overcome dataset limitations and gain prediction performance confidence. We look forward to supporting personalized cancer vaccine development with our pMHC immunogenicity predictions and applying our predictive biomarker on additional ICB cohorts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,Immune checkpoint blockade,Predictive biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Hima Anbunathan<sup><\/sup>, Neeraja Ravi<sup><\/sup>, <b>Rachel Marty Pyke<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Steven Dea<sup><\/sup>, Richard  O.

Hematopoietic lineage differentiation is subjected to genetic mutations that, due to fitness advantages, might give rise to clonally expanded populations. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is defined as the outgrowth of a single clone driven by acquired somatic mutation(s) in HSCs, in the absence of hematological abnormalities. Previous studies have been shown the association of CH with aging and a higher risk of developing secondary hematologic malignancies in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy agents. It is therefore of great interest to study CH incidence prior to and post chemotherapy exposure and its association with the evolution of hematologic malignancies. We aimed to characterize CHIP variants of a highly selected group of patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy; moreover, while previous CHIP studies are largely knowledge based and are limited to known hematologic genes or target gene panels, our study discovers novel CHIP mutations.<br \/>Methods: Comprehensive ultra-high-depth whole exome sequencing using unique molecular barcode technologies was performed using plasma-derived cell-free DNA and matched white blood cells DNA and tumor DNA from pre-NACT (n=12) and post-NACT (n=12) samples of patients with HGSC who have excellent or poor response to NACT. Using spike-in mutated DNAs as positive controls, we detected variant alleles at 1% variant allele frequency.<br \/>Results: We identified on average about 3,000 candidate CHIP variants in one patient. Among these, 1,977 variants affecting 1,375 genes were recurrently found in more than one patient. These CHIP genes include not only previous reported CHIP genes (e.g. DNMT3A, JAK2, TET2, and KMT2D) but also many novel CHIP candidates (such as RPTN, MTCH2, FAM186A, CACNA1A, FCGBP, and MUC3A). A number of CHIP mutations were uniquely found enriched in post-chemotherapy samples (e.g. ARID1A T290P, TP53 G245D, SMARCA4 G495D, and CIC T2456P). Interestingly, there is a strong enrichment of COSMIC cancer census genes in CHIP genes identified in every patient.<br \/>Conclusions: Our findings corroborate the notion that CHIP mutations are present in nonmalignant blood cells of patients with HGSC, and some are enriched after chemotherapy. Moreover, our innovative sequencing approach allowed discovery of novel candidate CHIP genes. The systematic identification of CHIP in patients with HGSC might be an important new clinical consideration when establishing chemotherapy protocols.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Circulating tumor DNA,Sequencing,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Sara Corvigno<sup><\/sup>, jun yao<sup><\/sup>, Li Zhao<sup><\/sup>, amma asare<sup><\/sup>, Joseph celestino<sup><\/sup>, richard hajek<sup><\/sup>, Ency Arboleda Goette<sup><\/sup>, Elaine Stur<sup><\/sup>, <b>Emine Bayraktar<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Mark S Kim<sup><\/sup>, ping song<sup><\/sup>, Qingxiu Zhang<sup><\/sup>, xingzhi song<sup><\/sup>, Mohammad Mohammad<sup><\/sup>, kenna Shaw<sup><\/sup>, Jianhua zhang<sup><\/sup>, karen lu<sup><\/sup>, amir jazaeri<sup><\/sup>, shannon westin<sup><\/sup>, anil sood<sup><\/sup>, Sanghoon Lee<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b189a06c-475d-4961-b8fc-c6386ea390f6","ControlNumber":"928","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

It is a highly infiltrating tumor. Complete eradication by surgery is difficult. The probability of survival beyond two years is very low. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a routine procedure for diagnosing gliomas. However, morphological MRI often fails to identify and quantify the presence of infiltration in peritumoral non-enhanced areas, resulting in inaccuracy in the assessment of invasive margins. Up to 50% of the patients show pseudo-progression. Morphological MRI fails to distinguish the marked enhancement in the tumor bed caused by radionecrosis from actual tumor progression. Diagnosis of GB recurrence through MR morphological sequences has a sensitivity and specificity of about 68% and 77%. Such percentages rise thanks to the use of non-morphological sequences (PWI, DWI, MRS), which are used in routine tumor protocols only in large centers and interpreted by expert neuroradiologists. Biomarkers in conjunction with MRI may help improve the classification, prognosis, and treatment choice. GB is highly infiltrated with monocytic cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), that invade the peripheral blood. Our group has recently identified a splice isoform of FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) as a reliable TAM marker. We found an expansion in circulating CD163\/FKBP51s monocytes in a cohort of GB patients. In patients with an MRI diagnosis of complete surgical tumor removal, these monocytes dramatically decreased. In patients with an MRI diagnosis of residual tumor, most of the peripheral CD163 monocytes that in the preoperative stage were FKBP51s- had turned into FKBP51s+. CD163\/FKBP51s+ monocytes helped to distinguish between radionecrosis and actual tumor progression. These results suggest that circulating CD163\/FKBP51s+ monocytes are associated with GB and can be helpful in monitoring GB patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Flow cytometry,Magnetic resonance imaging,Glioblastoma,Tumor associated macrophages,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Carolina Giordano<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Giuseppe Maria Della Pepa<sup>1<\/sup>, Simona Romano<sup>2<\/sup>, Laura Marrone<sup>2<\/sup>, Carlo Maria Donzelli<sup>1<\/sup>, Maria Fiammetta Romano<sup>2<\/sup>, Simona Gaudino<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore - Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli, Rome, Italy,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Naples Federico II, Napoli, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a87946fd-3425-40a1-9307-c8563d288a02","ControlNumber":"4321","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

In this work, we propose an improved predictor of ICI responses on the basis of our previous findings on the role of neoantigen functionality and genomic hypomethylation in tumor immunity. Specifically, we developed a metric of constitutive neoantigen load given the association of constitutive neoantigens derived from genes indispensable for cancer growth with favorable clinical responses to ICI (Clin. Transl. Med. 12:e714). A panel that captures somatic mutations on the 300 most essential genes identified by genome-wide screening in ~1,800 pan-cancer cell lines was used. Our DeepNeo algorithm (Nat. Commun. 11:951; Nat. Genet. 2023) was employed to identify T cell-reactive neoantigens from somatic mutations binding patient-matched HLA proteins. Also, considering the role of genomic hypomethylation in inducing resistance of tumors to ICI therapy (Nat. Commun. 10:4278), we developed an assay that estimates genomic hypomethylation by targeted sequencing of LINE-1 elements. Constitutive neoantigen load and LINE-1 methylation status were evaluated in our cohort consisting of 335 lung cancer patients treated with ICIs. As a result, constitutive neoantigen load (HR=0.671; p-value=3.13E-03) and LINE-1 methylation (HR=0.597; p-value=0.012) outperformed PD-L1 (HR=0.74; p-value=0.199), TMB (HR=0.917; p-value=0.511), and the combination of PD-L1 and TMB (HR=0.707; p-value=0.218). The combination of constitutive neoantigen load and LINE-1 methylation (HR=0.245; p-value=1.11E-05) showed even better predictive power. In conclusion, our approach can be used as new companion diagnostics for ICI-based immune-oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neoantigens,Immune checkpoint blockade,Methylation,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hyoeun Bang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jeong Yeon Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Cheolyong Joe<sup>3<\/sup>, Kyeonghui Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Younghak Bang<sup>3<\/sup>, Hyemin Kim<sup>4<\/sup>, Honghi Cha<sup>4<\/sup>, Eunjoo Oh<sup>4<\/sup>, Naeun Lee<sup>3<\/sup>, Inkyung Shin<sup>1<\/sup>, Seung-Jae Noh<sup>1<\/sup>, Dae-Yeon Cho<sup>1<\/sup>, Se-Hoon Lee<sup>4<\/sup>, Jung Kyoon Choi<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>PentaMedix Co., Ltd., Seongnam, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Bio and Brain Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Health Sciences and Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>Medicine, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c5d96355-ed8f-4fc0-8d39-ca77ee808636","ControlNumber":"2747","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;H.

However, ITs are still efficient only on a minority of the patients, especially for colorectal cancer (CRC), a high-incidence cancer. One hypothesis to explain the heterogeneity of the response to IT is that the presence or absence of immune factors within the tumor micro-environment (TME) may critically impact the efficacy of treatments. In this context, a deeper molecular understanding of the TME could be key to stratify patients. Here, we describe a proof of concept of the Veracyte Biopharma Atlas for CRC based on a multi-omics approach which integrates a unique range of assays allowing to decipher the immune contexture of tumors and offer a personalized and dynamic &#8220;fingerprint&#8221; of the interactions between the tumor and the immune system.<br \/>(b) Veracyte Biopharma Atlas characterizes the tumor microenvironment by analyzing information from 3 different modalities: (i) proteomics (Brightplex&#174; multiplex immunohistochemistry panels), (ii) transcriptomics (RNA sequencing) and (iii) genomics (somatic mutations by exome sequencing). This deep characterization of the tumor and its micro-environment requires the integration of thousands of features. The innovative Veracyte Biopharma Atlas approach relies on linear (multimodal factor analysis) and non-linear (self-organizing map) approaches with graphical representation of the data to integrate this multi-omics information.<br \/>(c) Gene expression profiling, genomics analysis and proteomics by multiplex spatial technology were performed on 47 CRC FFPE samples to characterize the immune contexture of this disease. Multimodal analysis was used to derive a unique atlas map highlighting clusters distinguished by complex features and their immune tumor contexture. Indeed, as examples, the atlas map allows the identification of a group of patients displaying high immune cell infiltration, including T cell and macrophages. They are also characterized by an immune genes signature.

Lung cancer has the highest percentage of incidence and is responsible for 27% of cancer-related deaths. The prevalence of lung cancer worldwide led us to investigate differential gene expression in lung adenocarcinoma and small cell lung cancer cell lines in comparison to a healthy lung cell line. We also investigated the effect of lung tumor microenvironment to bone marrow derived pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells (PMSC) and tumor associated macrophages. This research involved cancer and healthy cell line culture with appropriate medium. Whole transcriptomic and small non-coding RNA sequencing and analysis by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen, USA), Quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA assays. We further studied morphological changes and differential gene expression in extracellular vesicles(exosomes) isolated from the TAM and TME exposed PMCs by atomic force microscopy and RNA sequencing techniques. The results of our investigation showed differential gene expression and novel core canonical pathways in the lung cancer cells, TME exposed TAM, and PMSC. We also observed morphological changes in TME derived exosomes from TAM and PMSC. RNA sequencing results showed differential gene expression of both coding and non-coding RNAs including tRNA fragments. Thus, our findings of this investigation led to identification of multiple cancer related genes and small non-coding microRNA, long non-coding RNA, and tRNA fragments which will have potential diagnostic and therapeutic target value that demands further future research.

Despite the advances in immunotherapy (IO) treatment, robust predictive biomarkers are still required. The aim of this study was to identify a prognostic and predictive protein-based signature for advanced CM.<br \/>Methods: A training cohort of 142 pretreatment tumor samples from 71 patients with metastatic CM treated with IO (anti-PD-1) and an independent validation cohort from 67 patients with stage III treatment-na&#239;ve CM were analyzed by data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS). Survival analysis based initially on univariate regression and subsequently on 100 runs of 20-fold cross-validation of multivariate Cox regression with Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) was performed to obtain a reduced list of candidate proteins associated with melanoma-specific survival. A risk score was built from the final six proteins. The prognostic ability of this 6-protein signature for melanoma-specific survival was demonstrated by a time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and validated by four independent datasets. The predictive ability of the 6-protein signature was also explored in the training dataset using response to IO as the outcome of interest. Finally, differential expression analyses were conducted on the training data to identify the top proteins associated with response to IO. Proteins that were highly correlated (Pearson R<sup>2<\/sup> &#62;0.9) with the 6-protein signature were identified and subjected to pathway enrichment analysis (PEA).<br \/>Results: Proteomic analyses identified 4298 and 4577 proteins in the training and validation cohorts respectively, with 81.1% overlap between the two sets. Using LASSO multivariate Cox modeling, six proteins were identified in the training cohort, from which a risk score was calculated that dichotomized patients into high- and low-risk groups (Hazard ratio (HR) 2.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9-3.9, and, AUROC 0.86). The 6-protein signature&#8217;s prognostic performance was validated using the RNAseq dataset from the same training cohort (HR 2.7, p&#60;0.001), a second RNASeq dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (HR 1.7, p&#60;0.001), a single-cell RNASeq dataset from patients treated with IO (HR 1.2, p&#60;0.001) and finally a proteomic dataset in an independent cohort (stage III treatment-na&#239;ve CM) (HR 2.4, p&#60;0.001). The 6-protein signature was also associated with response to IO (HR 2.3, p=0.005). PEA showed that the highly correlated proteins were mostly related to DNA repair and DNA metabolic pathways. PEA revealed activation of immune-related pathways in patients who achieved a good response to IO.<br \/>Conclusion: A 6-protein signature identified a sub-group of patients with advanced CM who are at higher risk of progression on IO and death from melanoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Immunotherapy,Proteomics,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Srikanth Manda<sup>1<\/sup>, Adel  T.
