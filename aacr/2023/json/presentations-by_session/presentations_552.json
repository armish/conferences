The incidence of HNSCC in Puerto Rico is 2.5 higher than for Hispanics\/Latinos living in the United States. These health disparities are a serious public health concern due to HNSCC high mortality and morbidity rates, higher treatment costs, and significant quality of life burden. We hypothesized that the discovery of actionable targets for HNSCC early detection, diagnosis, prognostication. Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs) can be used as HNSCC diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic targets in precision medicine workflows. DNA from 23 HNSCC samples and 10 healthy oral tissue samples from patients in Puerto Rico were hybridized to a genome-wide tiling array to identify DMRs in a discovery cohort. Downstream analyses identified differences in promoter DNA methylation patterns in oral, laryngeal, and oropharyngeal anatomical regions associated with tumor differentiation, nodal involvement, and survival. Genome-wide DMR analysis showed 2,565 DMRs common to the three subsites. We identified 738 DMRs unique to laryngeal cancer (n=7), 889 DMRs unique to oral cavity cancer (n=10), and 363 DMRs unique to pharyngeal cancer (n=6). Based on the genome-wide analysis, and a gene ontology analysis, we selected 10 candidate genes to test for prognostic value and association with clinicopathological features. <i>TIMP3<\/i> was associated with tumor differentiation in oral cavity cancer (<i>p<\/i> =0.039), <i>DAPK1<\/i> was associated with nodal involvement in pharyngeal cancer (<i>p<\/i> = 0.017), and <i>PAX1<\/i> was associated with tumor differentiation in laryngeal cancer (<i>p<\/i> = 0.040). We selected 5 candidate genes, <i>DAPK1, CDH1, PAX1, CALCA, <\/i>and <i>TIMP3<\/i>, for a prevalence study in a larger validation cohort: 42 oral cavity; 25 pharyngeal; and 52 laryngeal cancer samples. <i>PAX1<\/i> hypermethylation differed across HNSCC anatomic sub-sites (p<i>=<\/i> 0.029), and predominantly detected in laryngeal cancer. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (p=0.043) and Cox regression analysis of overall survival (p=0.001) showed that <i>DAPK1 <\/i>methylation is associated with better prognosis in HNSCC.<b> <\/b>Our findings show that HNSCC sub-sites (oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx) display substantial differences in aberrant DNA methylation patterns among Hispanic\/Latinos HNSCC patients in the US. These data suggest further research may lead to the development of diagnostic medical devices, prognostic biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets that may lead to a reduction in HNSCC disparities among Hispanic\/Latinos in the US.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hispanic,DNA methylation,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"BIanca Rivera-Peña<sup>1<\/sup>, Oluwasina Folawiyo<sup>2<\/sup>, Nitesh Turaga<sup>2<\/sup>, Rosa  J.

Greater uptake of LDCT is hampered in part by its cost, inaccessibility, and balance of benefit to risk. A blood-based, low-cost, widely available initial blood test could boost screening participation and improve the net benefit of screening, if it were sensitive for cancer detection and affordable. The DELFI (DNA evaluation of fragments for early interception) technology uses low-coverage, whole-genome sequencing and machine learning to identify patterns of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentation indicative of cancer. We report initial results of the cfDNA analysis from DELFI-L101 (NCT04825834), a prospective, observational, national case-control study to train and test DELFI classifiers for lung cancer detection.<br \/>Methods: Eligible participants were adults &#8805;50 years old with current or previous smoking histories of &#8805;20 pack-years and recent or planned thoracic CT imaging. At enrollment, medical history was recorded and blood samples were collected for DELFI analysis. A classifier for lung cancer detection was developed using repeated 10-fold cross-validation. A split study approach for the purposes of independent validation of the classifier is forthcoming.<br \/>Results: The study cohort included 242 patients with lung cancer and 652 individuals without cancer. Study participants largely represented those of a lung cancer screening population, with 45% stage I\/IA. Most participants were &#8805;65 years old with roughly equal proportions of men and women. There was broad representation across lung cancer risk factors among both cases and controls. The cross-validated area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.81 for lung cancer detection. AUCs for adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma were not significantly different, but the AUC for small cell lung cancer was significantly higher than that for adenocarcinoma (p&#60;.001) and squamous cell carcinoma (p=.02). Clinically meaningful sensitivity to detect all stages of disease was achieved.<br \/>Conclusions: A classifier developed using samples collected prospectively distinguished between lung cancer cases and controls with robust cross-validated performance across all stages and lung cancer subtypes. A cfDNA DELFI fragmentome test could represent an affordable, high-performing blood test that may improve lung cancer screening.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-15 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Circulating cell-free DNA,Screening,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Peter J.

The poor screening and diagnosis of HCC and differences between racial\/ethnic groups show a disproportion in mortality rates. Examining an individual&#8217;s viral exposure history might serve as a useful biomarker of early disease that could address and, potentially, alleviate this disparity. We aim to investigate whether viral features can be used to identify HCC and individuals at high risk (HR) of HCC. Additionally, we examine the racial\/ethnic differences in viral exposures and whether viral exposure history accounts for epidemiological disparity described previously. Herein we use a technique called VirScan, which conjugates Phage Immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-seq) and DNA sequencing, to profile an individual&#8217;s epitope antibody repertoire upon viral exposure. We performed VirScan on serum and plasma samples from 199 AA (130 HR and 79 HCC) and 260 European Americans (EA) (210 HR and 50 HCC) participants from the NCI-UMD cohort (NCT00913757; clinicaltrials.gov). We used a machine-learning XGBoost model to classify viral features that can discriminate HCC or HR. A composite viral score was generated using the SHAP value of the most significant viral features from the model with a higher score more predictive of HCC. Secondary analyses using Wilcoxon-Rank sums tests and Cox proportional hazard analysis revealed that while race\/ethnicity did not differentially predict HCC in this cohort, the viral score was significantly higher in AA compared to EA in the HR group (p = 0.027). XGBoost search identified 235 important viral features which distinguish HCC from HR. Out of the 235 viral features, 20 viruses were different between AA and EA (FDR &#60; 0.05). We also found the viral score was positively associated with incident mortality in HCC group over the study period of 8 years (p=0.03). Thus, we demonstrate that the viral history of an individual might be useful in early detection of HCC. This approach could be used to account for the disparities we see in both incidence and mortality of HCC between AA and EA.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Early detection,Hepatocellular carcinoma,African American,VirScan,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Theressa Ewa<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Whitney L.

Selection of individuals for genetic testing for these conditions is based on personal and family history. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether screening in a tertiary medical center using exome sequencing could efficiently identify carriers of HBOC and LS and to determine the frequency of incremental carriers identified outside of traditional clinical practice guidelines.<br \/>Participants from three geographically diverse Mayo Clinic practices in the USA (Rochester MN, Phoenix AZ, Jacksonville FL) consented to clinical &#8220;Exome+&#8221; sequencing (Helix, San Mateo, CA; Mayo GeneGuide, Rochester, MN) in the TAPESTRY study (NCT05212428), which links sequencing data with electronic health records and the return of CDCT1 genetic findings. For this study we focused on two inherited cancer predisposition conditions: BRCA-related HBOC <i>(BRCA1<\/i> and <i>BRCA2<\/i>) and LS (<i>MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2<\/i> and <i>EPCAM<\/i>). Detailed chart review to collect demographic information, personal and family history, and assessment of clinical practice guidelines for genetic evaluation (National Cancer Control Network 2021).<br \/>To date, 44,306 patients have enrolled and sequenced in TAPESTRY. Annotation and interpretation of all variants in 7 genes for HBOC and LS resulted in identification of 550 carriers (prevalence 1.24%) which included 387 with HBOC (27.2% <i>BRCA1<\/i>, 42.8% <i>BRCA2<\/i>) and 163 with LS (12.3% <i>MSH6<\/i>, 8.8% <i>PMS2<\/i>, 4.5% <i>MLH1<\/i>, 3.8% <i>MSH2<\/i> and 0.2% <i>EPCAM<\/i>). Demographics of the cohort included: 62.7% female, mean age 55.2 years, non-white race 9.6% and 3.8% Hispanic\/Latino ethnicity. A personal history of cancer was present in 46.4% of test positive patients, including 22.5% of HBOC patients with breast or ovarian cancer and 20.9% of LS patients with colorectal or uterine cancer. More than half of the patients (52.1%) were newly diagnosed with HBOC and LS based on the results of this study. Overall, 39.2% of HBOC\/LS carriers identified through Exome+ sequencing did not satisfy NCCN criteria for genetic evaluation, this was higher for LS (56.2%) compared to HBOC (32%). Amongst those newly diagnosed with HBOC\/LS (n=286), NCCN criteria were not satisfied in 60% of cases (78% for LS and 51% for HBOC). Of the pathogenic germline variant carriers who met NCCN guidelines for testing, 34.2% were not aware of their diagnosis prior to participation in this study.<br \/>Our results emphasize the need for wide genomic screening for CDCT1 cancer predisposition syndromes. Such screening could identify at-risk carriers of HBOC and LS, who would not otherwise be identified through clinical practice guidelines.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-15 Screening and early detection,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomics,Cancer prevention,Cancer genomics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Emily Gay<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Niloy Jewel Samadder<sup>2<\/sup>, Michelle L.

We aimed to understand current patterns of LNG-IUS use and identify disparities that could inform implementation strategies for more effective and equitable uterine cancer primary prevention.<br \/>Methods: We analyzed LNG-IUS use among U.S. women aged 18-50 with the 2017-2019 National Survey of Family Growth. Statistical analysis was stratified by race, sociodemographic, and health factors. Predictors of LNG-IUS use were assessed through weighted multivariable logistic regression using the Wald chi-square test.<br \/>Results: Current LNG-IUS use was significantly lower in Hispanic women compared to White women (AOR 0.65, <i>P<\/i>=0.049). Compared to women with up to a high school education, LNG-IUS use was higher for women with a college degree or higher in the overall sample (AOR 1.86, <i>P<\/i>=0.009), White women (AOR 1.91, <i>P<\/i>=0.04), and Black women (AOR 4.54, <i>P<\/i>=0.007),<i> <\/i>but not for Hispanic women (AOR 0.79, <i>P<\/i>=0.64). All racial\/ethnic subgroups had lower odds of LNG-IUS for non-parous women than parous women (all <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.002). Although a known uterine cancer risk factor, obesity was not associated with LNG-IUS use.<br \/>Conclusions: Hispanic women, women with lower educational levels, and nulliparous women have disproportionately low LNG-IUS use despite being at increased uterine cancer risk. Community-based educational interventions for high-risk women and their providers on the benefits of LNG-IUS on uterine cancer prevention are needed to mitigate uterine cancer disparities.<br \/>Table

CRF was assessed as maximal aerobic workload on a cycle ergometer test and was classified as low, moderate, or high. BMI (kg\/m2) was classified as underweight (&#60;18.5), normal weight (18.5-24.9), overweight (25-29.9), or obesity (&#62;30). Data was cross-linked on individual level through the Swedish unique identification number with follow-up data from national registers with high validity containing information on cancer diagnosis and mortality. Follow-up started at diagnosis and continued until death, emigration, five years after diagnosis, or end of follow-up (2019-12-31), whichever happened earliest. Time-to-event multivariable Cox regression analyses included CRF and BMI as well as age, year, and site of conscription and age at diagnosis. For CRF, primary analyses tested linear trends with categorical comparisons for interpretation while categorical comparisons were primary analyses for BMI.<br \/>Results: 84,621 cancer cases were included in the main analyses. The mean age at diagnosis of any cancer was 53 years and follow-up data were available during a mean of 6.5 years. Lower CRF and higher BMI were independently associated with higher mortality for several cancer sites (table 1).<br \/>Conclusion: We report clinically relevant, dose-dependent associations between CRF and BMI in youth and 5-year mortality after diagnosis of 18 site-specific cancers in men. The associations with mortality may be due to both direct cancer inhibition and an improved tolerance to withstand cancer treatment. These results further strengthen the incentive for promoting a healthy lifestyle during the whole lifespan of the population.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{08A2374F-2617-47A0-89F2-2AC93B0BFE48}\"><caption>Table 1.

The VMB is taxonomically diverse, immunomodulatory, and racially differentiated. The VMB of Black women exhibits increased microbial diversity (associated with HPV tumorigenesis) and lower prevalence of taxa such as <i>Lactobacillus <\/i>(inversely associated with severity of cervical abnormalities) compared to white counterparts. Black women also have more persistent HPV infections and higher incidence of HSILs than whites. Our prior publication suggests the relationship between the VMB and HSIL might be differential by self-reported race. Herein we explore the underlying mechanisms by which race may lead to risk of HSIL through the VMB. We used 16S-rRNA VMB taxonomic profiles of 1,168 consented women receiving their annual routine exam between 2009-2013. Of these, 74 (6%) developed HSIL after the VMB sample collection (followed through 10\/2020). The VMB profiles were categorized into three subgroups, based on <i>a priori <\/i>knowledge, by taxonomic abundance as &#8220;<i>Lactobacillus crispatus&#8221;<\/i> (including <i>L. crispatus<\/i>, <i>L. gasseri <\/i>and <i>L. jensenii<\/i>, all generally associated with gynecologic health), &#8220;<i>L. iners&#8221; <\/i>(considered a transitional state), and &#8220;Other&#8221; (including taxa, such as <i>Gardenerella vaginalis<\/i>, <i>Atopibium vaginae<\/i>, <i>Lachnocurva vaginae<\/i> and others often associated with adverse gynecologic outcomes). HPV status was obtained by sequencing a fragment of the L1 gene. We used self-reported health histories, confirmed by electronic health records where available, and other socio-demographic information. HIV-positive women were excluded. We used structural equations modeling, following a normal theory maximum likelihood approach with robust errors to estimate the proportion of the association between race and HSIL mediated by the VMB, using STATA version 13.1. The cohort was predominantly Black (72%), with VMB prevalence by subgroup of 18%, 29% and 52% for <i>L. crispatus<\/i>, <i>L. iners<\/i>, and Other, respectively. Blacks had a higher prevalence of the &#8220;Other&#8221; VMB subtype, compared to nL-whites (59% vs. 49%). Forty-five percent of the sample tested positive for HPV, with no significant difference by race (p=0.9). The incidence of HSIL was nearly double for Blacks compared to whites (7% to 4%). Women with HSIL exhibited a higher prevalence of the &#8220;Other&#8221; VMB (68% vs. 51%) and were more likely to be HPV positive (73%vs. 44%) than their healthy counterparts. In SEM, only the following path was statistically significant at p&#38;lt;0.05: race&#224;VMB&#224;HSIL, with an estimated proportion mediated by this path of 36%. Findings suggest the VMB is a mediator that might explain some of the underlying mechanisms of the relationship between race and risk of HSIL. If confirmed, this might have potential prophylactic and therapeutic implications as the VMB is amenable to pre and probiotics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PR01-03 Cancer disparities research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Microbiome,Cervical cancer,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Race,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Katherine Y.
