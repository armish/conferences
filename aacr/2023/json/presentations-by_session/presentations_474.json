[{"Abstract":"Introduction: Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is an asymptomatic premalignant plasma cell disorder with an annual risk of ~1% of progression to more advanced diseases, including multiple myeloma (MM). Few studies reported mortality risk in patients with MGUS, among which the diagnosis of MGUS was typically incidental due to unrelated symptoms or laboratory abnormalities. This study aims to compare the survival of MGUS patients with the U.S. general population using a nationally representative screening-based survey.<br \/>Methods: Data were obtained from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) 1988-1994 and continuous NHANES 1999-2004, with follow-up all-cause mortality data through December 31, 2019. Participants were screened for MGUS by protein electrophoresis, immunofixation, and kappa and lambda free light chain assays in serum. Multivariable Cox-proportional regressions were performed, adjusting for demographic characteristics (age, gender, race\/ethnicity, education, income, body mass index [BMI]), health behaviors (smoking, physical activity), baseline medical conditions (hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease [PVD], arthritis, liver diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal diseases, cancer), and survey year. We also tested the interaction between race\/ethnicity and MGUS diagnosis in the fully adjusted model. The NHANES complex sampling design was accounted for in all analyses to obtain population estimates.<br \/>Results: The prevalence of MGUS among the U.S. population aged 50 years or older was 2.5% in 1988-1994 (sample size n=6,557; population size N=56,136,480) and 2.3% in 1999-2004 (n=5,847; N=68,835,295). MGUS patients were older and more likely to have PVD (13.1% vs. 7.7%, p = 0.03). No evidence was found showing a difference in gender distribution, education, income, BMI, and other comorbidities between the two populations. In NHANES 1999-2004, MGUS was associated with an increased risk of death (Hazard ratios [HR] 1.20, 95% CI: 1.02-1.41, p = 0.03) compared to the general population. NHANES III also showed a trend toward increased risk of mortality (HR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.89-1.48, p = 0.27). No interaction between race\/ethnicity and MGUS diagnosis was found. It was notable that PVD was associated with an increased risk of death (HR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.43-1.94, p &#60; 0.001).<br \/>Conclusion: In the large cohort of NHANES participants, MGUS was associated with an increased risk of mortality. MGUS is typically viewed as a &#8220;benign&#8221; condition that has the potential to progress to cancer. These findings suggest that there may be alternate health implications to a diagnosis of MGUS. Future studies should focus on the causes of death in this population and the role of MGUS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-05 Descriptive epidemiology, covering cancer incidence, mortality, clusters, and trends,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mortality,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mengmeng Ji<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, John Huber<sup>1<\/sup>, Mei Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Yi-Hsuan Shih<sup>1<\/sup>, Yao-Chi Yu<sup>1<\/sup>, Lawrence Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Theodore Thomas<sup>3<\/sup>, Martin  W.

We thus searched related publications in the last decade and wrote an extensive literature review on the topic.<br \/>Method: We conducted an extensive search for electronic database via MEDLINE and PubMed. Using the key terms &#8220;progression-free survival (PFS) leukemia&#8221; and restricting the search to &#8220;English language&#8221; for the last decade, we initially found 1,083 published papers on the related topic. On the basis of review, we collected necessary data and extracted some recommendations for treatment of leukemia patients.<br \/>Results: Standard treatments such as Daunorubicin, Doxorubicin, or Asparaginase for leukemias in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) were associated with high rates of relapse and other complications within 5 years post-treatment. Of note, Blinatumomab and Ibrutinib-Rituximab showed higher success rates of PFS and overall survival compared to other chemotherapy treatments. Two-year disease free survival was 39.0% for patients with intensive chemotherapy while it was 54.4% for patients given the anticancer drugs. In addition, two-year overall survival was relatively worse (58.4%) in patients treated with chemotherapy compared with those with other treatments (71.3%). In comparison, radiotherapy has been used for patients who relapsed after remission and found to be more successful in the long run in preventing another relapse and leading to higher rates of overall survival. For example, patients previously experienced a 78% response rate to the treatment received cranial radiation; compared to the survival rate (11.3%) of patients who were not treated with the radiation, they experienced higher four-year survival rates (77.7%). For most pediatric leukemias, allogenic stem cell therapies have been the most effective treatment with a higher rate of remission. However, after this treatment, a majority of the patients relapsed soon after and were unable to continue fighting the disease, resulting in death. Of note, during the past 10 years, some immunotherapies have been discovered and reported more effective than traditional chemo\/radiotherapies and allogenic\/autologous stem cell treatments. In particular, Tisagenlecleucel, a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, has been approved to treat pediatric leukemias when they have relapsed after initial or tertiary remission. Their 5 or 10 year survival rate after this treatment was over 50%.<br \/>Conclusion: Among the standard treatments that have been studied during a decade for leukemia in children and adolescents, CAR T-cell immunotherapy appears to be the most effective after patient relapse. More research for the immunotherapies on different populations with diverse age groups is requested on a tertiary prevention perspective.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-24 Survivorship research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias,Tertiary prevention,Immunotherapy,Survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nikita Manyak<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Su Yon Jung<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UCLA - University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"62108cce-904e-416f-8c25-f9dd680ee4dd","ControlNumber":"4592","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>N.

Healthy food consumption is a modifiable factor shown to reduce obesity-related cancer mortality, but residing in geographical areas with poor access to grocery stores\/farmer&#8217;s markets (food deserts) or higher access to fast-food\/convenience stores (food swamps) reduces healthy food access and has been severely understudied.<br \/>Methods: We conducted an ecological study utilizing 2010 - 2020 data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Environment Atlas and Center for Disease Control and Prevention mortality. 3,041 U.S. counties with complete information on food environment scores and obesity-related cancer mortality data were included. Food swamp score was calculated as the ratio of fast-food and convenience stores to grocery stores and farmer&#8217;s markets. Obesity-related cancer (based on the International Agency for Research on Cancer evidence between obesity and 13 types of cancer) mortality rates were categorized as high (&#8805;71.8 per 100,000) versus low (&#60;71.8 per 100,000) per county. We performed an age-adjusted multivariable polytomous logistic regression for the association between food desert scores, food swamp scores, and obesity-related cancer mortality rates.<br \/>Results: Counties with high obesity-related cancer mortality rates had higher percentage of NH-black population (3.30 vs 1.80), persons older than 65 years (15.7 vs 15.4), poverty rates (19.0 vs 14.4), adult obesity rates (33.0 vs 32.1), and adult diabetes rates (12.5 vs 10.7) when compared to counties with low obesity-related cancer mortality (p-value &#60; 0.0001; Table 1). We observed 77% increased odds of having high obesity-related cancer mortality rates among U.S. counties with high food swamp scores (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.43 - 2.18). A positive dose-response relationship between three levels of food desert and food swamp scores and obesity-related cancer mortality was also observed (p-value &#60;0.0001).<br \/>Conclusions and Relevance: Policymakers, funding agencies, and community stakeholders should implement sustainable approaches at combating obesity and establishing healthier accessible food such as creating more walkable neighborhoods and community gardens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-05 Descriptive epidemiology, covering cancer incidence, mortality, clusters, and trends,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer prevention,Cancer risk,Diet,Environmental exposure,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Malcolm Bevel<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Meng-Han Tsai<sup><\/sup>, April Parham<sup><\/sup>, Sydney Andrzejak<sup><\/sup>, Samantha  R.

BRCA1\/2 germline mutation carriers have a high risk of developing breast cancer at young age, yet it is unknown if recent childbirth is a poor prognostic risk factor for BRCA1\/2 carriers. Here we assessed whether time between last childbirth and breast cancer diagnosis impacted survival among early-onset BRCA1\/2 breast cancer patients. METHODS: The study population includes 903 female BRCA1\/2 mutation carriers diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer at &#8804;45 years of age between 1950 and 2021 in the UK. The primary outcome of this study is all-cause mortality. The primary exposures were no prior childbirth (n=224), or time between last childbirth and breast cancer diagnosis grouped as 0-&#60;5 years (n=228), 5-&#60;10 years (n=191), or &#8805;10 years since last childbirth (n=260). Cox proportional hazards regression was applied to identify factors associated with risk of 20-year mortality. RESULTS: Breast cancer diagnosed 5-&#60;10 years after last childbirth was associated with an elevated risk for mortality [HR=1.56 (95% CI, 1.05-2.30)] compared to nulliparous cases after adjusting for patient age and tumor stage. Across groups, nulliparous women had the best prognosis, suggesting parity may increase risk of death in BRCA1\/2 carriers. ER-negative cancers were the dominant tumor type across all groups: 54.8% (nulliparous), 52.6% [postpartum breast cancer (PPBC) &#60;5], 58.4% (PPBC 5-&#60;10), and 54.0% (&#8805;10). ER-negative cases were more prevalent among BRCA1 carriers (77%) compared to BRCA2 carriers (24%). In stratified analyses by either ER or BRCA status, increased mortality in the PPBC 5-&#60;10 group was significant for ER-negative cases [HR=3.12 (95% CI, 1.22-7.97)] and BRCA1 carriers [HR=2.03 (95% CI, 1.15-3.58)], compared to nulliparous groups. For ER-positive cases, 71% of cases were BRCA2 carriers, and the most significant postpartum interval among ER-positive cases was observed in the 0-&#60;5 group [HR=2.35 (95% CI, 1.02-5.42)]. No association was observed for BRCA2 carriers with PPBC 0-&#60;5 vs nulliparous groups [HR=1.26 (95% CI, 0.73-2.16)].CONCLUSION: Results suggest that BRCA1\/2 breast cancer patients are at increased risk for all-cause mortality if diagnosed within 10 years of childbirth. For ER-positive disease, poorest prognosis occurs within 0-5 years postpartum, consistent with promotion of existing sub-clinical tumors. For BRCA2 carriers, the association between postpartum diagnosis and mortality is weak. For ER-negative disease, similar to BRCA1 carriers, poorest prognosis occurs 5-10 years postpartum, suggesting an interaction between BRCA1 and parity may result in increased tumor initiation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-05 Descriptive epidemiology, covering cancer incidence, mortality, clusters, and trends,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,BRCA1,BRCA2,Survival,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zhenzhen Zhang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Shangyuan Ye<sup>1<\/sup>, D Gareth Evans<sup>2<\/sup>, Pepper Schedin<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR,<sup>2<\/sup>The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d10b8005-6869-44e2-9f6e-fca6b732db23","ControlNumber":"4084","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Z.

At present, there are no standard of care biomarkers to inform the first-line treatment regimen (neoadjuvant chemotherapy vs. upfront surgical debulking) best suited for each patient or which patients are at the highest risk of recurrence. To address this unmet need, we identified pre-treatment computed tomography (CT) image-based radiomic features predictive of outcomes and primary treatment response among 298 women diagnosed with serous ovarian cancer from 2008 to 2019. A decision tree analysis identified a single volumetric feature, region of interest (ROI) volume center of mass (CoM) in the X direction, as the most informative radiomic feature that stratified patients with upfront surgery into high- and low-risk groups for overall survival. The high-risk group consists of patients with higher values of the radiomic feature. In the training (N=91) and test (N=91) cohorts of women treated with upfront surgery, high-risk patients had worse survival compared to low-risk patients (HR=2.01, 95% CI=1.07, 3.77 and HR=2.23, 95% CI=1.19, 4.17, respectively). This radiomic feature was not associated with survival among women treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (N=116; HR=1.23, 95% CI=0.73, 2.07). To reveal potential underlying biology of this radiomic feature, we performed RNAseq gene expression profiling on 47 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor specimens and correlated gene expression with the radiomic feature using DESeq2 from RSEM estimates. Dichotomized analysis (high- vs. low-risk) yielded 7 significant genes and continuous analysis yielded 15 significant genes (adjusted p&#60;0.05), with both approaches identifying <i>AKT2 <\/i>and <i>PSMC4<\/i>. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to identify enriched gene sets from continuous associations using the MSigDB Hallmarks pathways (adjusted p&#60;0.05). GSEA identified the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway as one of the gene sets most negatively associated with the predictive radiomic feature (Hallmark Normalized Enrichment Score=-2.28, adjusted p&#60;0.001). We derived a PCA-based gene signature from significantly associated OXPHOS genes (p&#60;0.01) resulting in a negative correlation with the radiomic feature (R=-0.65, p&#60;0.001). Prior studies have shown that high OXPHOS ovarian tumors are associated with an increased response to conventional chemotherapy, suggesting that OXPHOS may be a key pathway for chemoresistance in ovarian cancer. In summary, we identified an OXPHOS-associated radiomic feature predictive of survival among women with serous ovarian cancer treated with upfront surgery. Further research is needed to elucidate the biologic and mechanistic underpinnings of the identified radiomic feature and to validate these findings in a larger cohort of women with ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-03 Biomarkers of prognosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epidemiology,Ovarian cancer,Survival,Imaging,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Christelle Colin-Leitzinger<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jaileene Perez-Morales<sup><\/sup>, Steven Eschrich<sup><\/sup>, Jamie  K.

However, it remains unclear whether serum cholesterol and lipoproteins are associated with prostate cancer outcomes. Studies on serum cholesterol and cancer are often confounded by lifestyle factors such as diet and obesity. A possible solution is to use instrumental variables, such as SNPs predicting serum cholesterol. According to the Mendelian randomization theory, germline SNP distribution is unaffected by confounding variables such as diet and lifestyle factors. <b>Objective<\/b>: To estimate whether SNPs that predict serum cholesterol and lipoproteins also predict mortality among a cohort of men with prostate cancer. <b>Methods<\/b>: Our study cohort consisted of 3,241 men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1996-2015, using data collected by the Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer. Blood samples were genotyped by PRACTICAL consortium. A UCSC genome browser was utilized for selecting 85 SNPs in lipid metabolism-associated genes. Dates and causes of deaths between 1996-2015 were obtained from the Statistics Finland's statistics on causes of death. Information on serum cholesterol and lipoprotein measurements were obtained from a regional laboratory database.Scores predicting serum cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglyceride level by SNP genotype were created using linear regression and lasso regression. Risk of prostate cancer death and overall mortality by level of the SNP risk score were evaluated with multivariable-adjusted Cox regression.

While telomere shortening in blood cells is a biomarker of aging, its relationship to lung cancer prognosis remains unclear due to limited sample size, confounding, and reverse causation from observational studies. As telomere length could be a precursor of worse prognosis, a causal inference method is needed to clarify the role of telomere length in predicting lung cancer outcomes.<br \/>Methods: A Mendelian Randomization study for the causal relationship between telomere length and overall survival in lung cancer was carried out. We searched the GWAS catalog for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with telomere length and collected effect estimates for the association between each SNP and telomere length from the literature. The summary data for all SNPs were acquired by analyzing their associations with overall survival of lung cancer patients in the Boston Lung Cancer Study (BLCS) and through Cox proportional hazards regression. The effect size of telomere length on overall survival was calculated and compared through several weighting methods including inverse-variance weighting (IVW) and MR-Egger.<br \/>Results: A total of 16 SNPs were identified as the genetic instruments for telomere length. 1798 lung cancer patients from BLCS provided survival data with a median follow-up of 33 months. Surprisingly, a non-significant <i>positive<\/i> trend was observed for the association between telomere length and overall survival across the weighting methods (IVW: HR 1.718, 95%CI 0.849 - 3.476; MR-Egger: HR 2.347, 95%CI 0.592 - 9.309). Further analysis is ongoing to incorporate more patients and genetic instruments for additional markers of biological aging in the BLCS to explore the source of heterogeneity (I<sup>2<\/sup>= 98.1%) in the present study and gain more power for detecting the underlying relationship between telomere length and overall survival in lung cancer.<br \/>Conclusion: A positive trend between telomere length and risk of death in lung cancer patients is consistent with previous reports of an association between increased cancer risk and longer telomere length, but is seemingly at odds with an established link between chronological age and poor lung cancer prognosis. Since markers of biological aging are strongly correlated with chronological age, we conclude that a more robust assessment of biological age will be needed to clarify the causal relationship between telomere length and lung cancer prognosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-03 Biomarkers of prognosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Molecular epidemiology,Lung cancer,Aging,Prognosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ting Zhai<\/b><sup><\/sup>, David  C.

Data on number of actively practicing PCPs in all 50 states and D.C. for the year 2020 were obtained from Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) State Physician Workforce Data Report. The correlation between the ratio of number of PCPs per CRC case with age-adjusted mortality rate (AAMR) for CRC was studied by state and within White and African American (AA) populations from 2017-2019.

Statin is a class of commonly prescribed medications used for treatment of high cholesterol. Studies have shown that statin exhibits anticancer effects, and the use of statin is associated with improved survival of common cancers, such as prostate, breast and colorectal cancers. However, few research has been conducted on statin use in relation to the survival of HNSCC. This study assessed whether statin use after HNSCC diagnosis is associated with overall survival among patients with HNSCC in the U.S. military health system (MHS). The MHS provides universal health care to its beneficiaries with no or little out-of-pocket cost, thus a study in the MHS reduces the effects of prescription drug access related to patients&#8217; insurance coverage, race and socio-economic status. This study included 1,842 adult patients (18 or older) with histologically confirmed HNSCC identified from the MilCanEpi database which contains information from the Department of Defense&#8217;s Central Cancer Registry (CCR) and the Military Health System Data Repository (MDR). Patients were diagnosed between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2014 and followed up through December 31, 2015. Statin use was extracted from the MDR pharmacy data containing prescription records from all sources. Among the 1,842 patients, 389 patients used statin after HNSCC diagnosis. Time-dependent multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the relationship between post-diagnosis statin use and overall survival, reducing the potential effects of immortal time bias. Statistical adjustment was made for covariables including age, sex, race, Hispanic ethnicity, active-duty status, history of cardiovascular diseases, Charlson comorbidity index, baseline statin use, tumor site, tumor stage and cancer treatments. Increased post-diagnosis cumulative use of statin (per one-year of use) conferred a significant improved survival with adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.70 (95% CI=0.55 to 0.90). When analysis was stratified by status of statin use prior to HNSCC diagnosis, the HRs were 0.36 (95% CI=0.19-0.69) and 0.81 (95% CI=0.59-1.11) for those who used and did not use it before the diagnosis, respectively.

The breast cancer mortality rate is higher in Guam than in the U.S. (27.3 vs 20.3 per 100,000 women, age-adjusted, 2013-2017 data); even though the incidence rate remains lower (86.6 vs 126.8 respectively). Guam has major ethnic disparities in breast cancer survival with CHamoru (indigenous people) and Micronesian (immigrants from other Micronesian Islands) faring much worse than other ethnic groups. The purpose of this study was to determine the survival rates of breast cancer patients in Guam and examine the effects of demographic and other mortality risk factors on breast cancer survival.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: This study included 1105 women diagnosed with primary invasive breast cancer and reported to the Guam Cancer Registry from 1998-2020. Five-year and 10-year survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared using the log-rank test across different ethnic groups: CHamoru (N = 528), Filipino (N = 336), Asian (N = 66), Micronesian (N = 51), and Caucasian (N = 71). The Cox proportional hazards regression was used to investigate the effects of age, year of diagnosis, ethnicity, breast cancer staging, and cancer treatment status on the risk of all-cause mortality.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Mean age at diagnosis was 58.2 years. Significant differences in the 5-year and 10-year survival rates were found across ethnic groups. Micronesians had the lowest 5-year and 10-year survival rates (55.9% and 48.5%) followed by CHamorus (81.1% and 68.1%, respectively). All-cause mortality was higher among CHamoru (HR = 2.28, 95% CI: 1.65, 3.16) and Micronesian women (HR=5.33, 95% CI: 3.30, 8.61) compared with Filipino women after adjusting for age, year of diagnosis, staging, and cancer treatment status. All-cause mortality among White and Asian women was not statistically significantly different from that among Filipino women.

Large prospective studies have found significant correlations between dietary intake and cancer. Chronic inflammation promotes pro-cancer inflammatory environments and nutrition can influence inflammation, with the intake of certain food items increasing inflammatory biomarkers. The objective of this research was to explore the relationship between inflammatory diet score measured by the Dietary Inflammatory index and all-cause mortality, cancer-specific mortality, and cancer recurrence among cancer survivors.<b> <\/b>Web of Science, Medline, CINHAL, and PsycINFO<b> <\/b>databases were searched to collect potentially eligible sources that focus on dietary inflammation and cancer outcomes. All sources were uploaded to Covidence software and screened by two independent blinded reviewers. The quality of the sources was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa scale and relevant data was extracted and transferred<b> <\/b>to the Comprehensive Meta Analysis software and a random effects model was used to perform meta-analysis.<b> <\/b>Of the 1444 studies imported into the Covidence software, 13 passed all the screening stages and were included in the final analysis. Eight studies reported on pre-diagnosis diet while five others reported on post-diagnosis diet. Five studies reported on colorectal cancer, four on breast cancer, two on ovarian cancer, one on endometrial cancer and one on prostate cancer. Meta-analysis of the studies found that being in the highest postdiagnosis DII score indicating pro-inflammatory diet significantly increased the risk of all-cause death among cancer survivors by 33.5% (HR = 1.335, 95% CI = 1.049, 1.698, <i>n<\/i> = 6). Analysis did not show a statistically significant association between DII score and cancer mortality or recurrence (HR = 1.097, 95% CI = 0.939, 1.281, <i>n<\/i> = 6). Analysis by cancer subtype found a significant correlation between postdiagnosis DII score and all-cause mortality among the breast cancer survivors (HR = 1.335, 95% CI = 1.041, 1.711, <i>n<\/i> = 3) though there were no significant associations between DII and the outcomes of interest from the other cancer types. The meta-analysis concludes that being in the highest postdiagnosis DII score group significantly increased the risk of all-cause death among cancer survivors. This suggests that risk of all-cause mortality could be reduced for cancer survivors by consuming more anti-inflammatory food components and reducing consumption of pro-inflammatory foods.

A recent review summarized 76 studies using this approach, finding that several factors (alcohol consumption, BMI, telomere length, hormones) likely cause cancer. However, this article also highlighted the need for larger studies incorporating more, newly discovered associated, variants in the E-PRS and investigating specific cancer types vs. all cancers and cancer subtypes.<br \/>Methods: We used 21 published E-PRS that were derived from summary statistics of large genome-wide association studies using PRSCS. We evaluated 15 continuous and 6 binary E-PRS for factors that are known or hypothesized to contribute to cancer risk or progression and their association with prostate cancer aggressiveness and death. Our sample included 1784 unrelated, genotyped prostate cancer patients from the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI). Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate these 21 E-PRS's odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for high- vs. low-stage, high- vs. low-grade, and aggressive (high-stage or -grade) vs. non-aggressive (low-stage and -grade) prostate cancer. Cox regression was used to evaluate the hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% CI of prostate cancer deaths by E-PRS. Lasso and Ridge regressions were used to reduce model complexity and prevent overfitting for the final E-PRS model. All multivariable models were adjusted for age, genotyping batch, recruiting study, and genetic PCs.<br \/>Results: For high- vs. low-stage prostate cancer, we detected statistically significant associations with E-PRS for type 2 diabetes (per standard deviation (SD) change OR=0.86, 95% CI=0.77-0.97) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (per SD change OR=1.19, 95% CI=1.00-1.41). We also observed a suggestive inverse association with sleep apnea E-PRS. We observed no statistically significant associations for high- vs. low-grade prostate cancer, but there was a possible inverse association with the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) E-PRS. We noticed no statistically significant associations when comparing aggressive vs. non-aggressive prostate cancer; however, suggestive inverse associations with E-PRS for DBP and smoking were found. For prostate cancer death, we observed a statistically significant decreased risk of death with higher BMI E-PRS (per SD HR=0.29, 95% CI: 0.09 - 0.89). We also observed a suggestive inverse association with the eGFR E-PRS. Similar results were found in Lasso and Ridge regression.<br \/>Conclusions: Several E-PRS were significant predictors of aggressive or fatal prostate cancer. In the future, we will test significant E-PRS from this analysis to determine whether they predict aggressiveness or mortality in newly recruited MGI prostate cancer cases in 2022.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-21 Risk prediction models for incidence, prognosis, and\/or mortality,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Electronic Health Records,Polygenic Risk Scores,Survival and Aggressiveness,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xinman Zhang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Lars G.

Early identification of signs and symptoms, and prompt specialist availability and referral, are crucial for diagnosis and treatment at earlier stages. Mounting physician shortages are a growing concern, and we sought to analyze their effect on NHL mortality rates.<br \/>Methods: We extracted data on the age-adjusted mortality rate (AAMR) and crude incidence rate (CIR) of NHL for all U.S. states and the District of Columbia from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) database (2017-2019). Nevada was excluded due to missing information. Data on the state-wise number of primary care physicians (PCPs) was obtained from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) state physician workforce data report (2020), and of Hematology\/Oncology specialists (HOs) was gathered from the National Provider Identifier (NPI) registry (2020). The number of PCPs and HOs per each NHL incidence (PCP\/CIR, HO\/CIR respectively) was then calculated. Correlations were analyzed using Pearson&#8217;s coefficient. Statistical analysis was performed using VassarStats.<br \/>Results: Median AAMR for NHL in the US was 5.15 (IQR 4.35, 5.95) per 100, 000 population. The median number of PCP and HO per each case of NHL incidence was 4.32 (IQR 3.43, 5.21), and 0.28 (IQR 0.1, 0.37) respectively. States with fewer PCPs per each NHL incidence had higher AAMR (r=-0.37, p=0.007). States with a lower number of HOs per each NHL incidence had higher AAMR (r=-0.41, p=0.003)<br \/>Conclusions: Based on the analysis, the availability of a lower number of PCPs and HOs per each NHL incidence is associated with increased AAMR of the disease. This data may strengthen the need for intensification of focus on decreasing the soaring physician shortages in the states, in order to help decrease the overall mortality associated with NHL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-12 Health services and comparative effectiveness research,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Databases,Mortality,Primary care access,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shiva Jashwanth Gaddam<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Udhayvir Singh Grewal<sup>2<\/sup>, Zara Hassan<sup>1<\/sup>, Poornima Ramadas<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Feist Weiller Cancer Center, Shreveport, LA,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"28b7e266-1c1f-47e8-b703-f26f2e63bef7","ControlNumber":"7888","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Lifestyle risk factor modifications have improved the quality of life in MM patients, however, their effect on the survival outcomes in these patients remains unknown.<br \/>Methods: We extracted data on age-adjusted mortality rate (AAMR) rates of MM (per 100,000 population) for all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) WONDER database (2015-2019). Data on risk factors such as obesity, physical activity, alcohol, tobacco abuse, and nutrition were obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS, 2021). Florida was excluded due to missing information. Correlations were analyzed using Pearson&#8217;s coefficient. Statistical analysis was performed using VassarStats.<br \/>Results: Median AAMR of MM in the US was 3.2 (IQR 2.7, 3.7) per 100,000 population. States with higher age-adjusted prevalence (AAP) percentages of obesity had higher AAMR (r=0.39, p=0.004) of MM. This association was significant in non-Hispanic white (r=0.32, p=0.021), and non-Hispanic black (r=0.31, p=0.034) subgroups as well. States with a higher AAP of adherence to recommended weekly aerobic activity had lower AAMR (r=-0.37, p=0.007). We did not identify any correlation of AAMR with AAP of binge drinking (r=-0.036, p=0.803), consumption of fruits (r=0.04, p=0.75), vegetables (r=-0.133, p=0.357), and smoking history (r=0.052, p=0.72).<br \/>Conclusions: In the current analysis, a higher prevalence of obesity and lower rates of aerobic physical activity were strongly associated with increased AAMR of MM. Our results, therefore, underscore the need for emphasis on a holistic approach in the management of MM by including lifestyle-based risk factor modification, to further improve the survival outcomes in patients with MM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-06 Diet, alcohol, tobacco use, and other lifestyle risk factors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mortality,Multiple myeloma,Obesity,Physical activity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shiva Jashwanth Gaddam<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Udhayvir Singh Grewal<sup>2<\/sup>, Himaja Kumari Avvaru<sup>3<\/sup>, Poornima Ramadas<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Feist Weiller Cancer Center, Shreveport, LA,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA,<sup>3<\/sup>LSU Health Shreveport, Shreveport, LA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a6868967-ecb3-4ac8-896f-ce09b4a7b9b5","ControlNumber":"7805","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

There is growing interest in the biological relevance of subtyping using immunohistochemistry (IHC).<br \/>Methods: Women with primary invasive OEC diagnosed from 1989 to 2010 were retrospectively identified from the population-based Alberta Cancer Registry, Canada. Pathology slide review and IHC staining for Napsin A, TP53, and WT1 were used to reduce histologic misclassification, resulting in N=166 participants (low-stage N=138, high-stage N=28), excluding those who received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. The following markers were stained and scored on tissue microarrays: TP53<i> <\/i>(normal\/abnormal), PMS2\/MSH6 (mismatch repair proficient [MMRp]\/deficient [MMRd]), PGR (loss\/retained), and CTNNB1 (nuclear\/cytoplasmic). Using a hierarchical decision tree by stage group (low\/high), we categorized tumors as TP53 abnormal, MMRd, PGR loss, nuclear CTNNB1, and no specific immunohistochemical profile (NSIP). Distributions and five-year disease specific survival (DSS) was estimated for each group; hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for age were estimated using Cox regression with NSIP as referent group.<br \/>Results: Among low-stage cases, five-year survival was as follows: 80% for TP53 abnormal (N=10, 7%), 87% for MMRd (N=15, 11%), 80% for PGR loss (N=10, 7%), 98% for nuclear CTNNB1 (N=63, 46%), and 95% for NSIP group (N=40, 29%). Overall, IHC group was associated with DSS among low stage cases (LRT p-value=0.006), and the group with nuclear CTNNB1 had a small but statistically significant DSS advantage (HR=0.089, 95% CI 0.011-0.742, p=0.025). TP53 and PGR loss suggested shorter DSS than the referent NSIP group, but not statistically significantly so (HR=1.26 and 3.08, respectively). Among high-stage cases, five-year DSS was as follows: 57% for TP53 abnormal (N=7, 25%), 75% for MMRd (N=8, 29%), 33% for nuclear<i> <\/i>CTNNB1 (N=3, 11%), and 17% for NSIP (N=10, 36%). There were no high-stage cases in the PGR-loss group. Nuclear CTNNB1 group had a shorter DSS among high-stage cases, but this was not statistically significantly so (HR=1.16, p=0.85).<br \/>Conclusion: Pending replication in additional datasets, results suggest that OEC cases in nuclear CTNNB1 or NSIP IHC groups may have a favorable prognosis in which de-escalation of therapy can be considered. In addition, abnormal TP53 and loss of PGR may identify a high-risk subset of low-stage OEC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-03 Biomarkers of prognosis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Protein expression,Gynecological cancers: ovarian,Survival,Tumor markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Brooke Jorgensen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Stacey Winham<sup>1<\/sup>, Julie Cunningham<sup>2<\/sup>, Sebastian Armasu<sup>1<\/sup>, Chen Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Hunter Atkinson<sup>1<\/sup>, Bryan McCauley<sup>1<\/sup>, Linda Kelemen<sup>3<\/sup>, Martin Koebel<sup>4<\/sup>, Ellen Goode<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, Columbia, SC,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"40bc25cc-772e-4efd-b207-e65b4b175943","ControlNumber":"2303","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>B.
