[{"Abstract":"Background: Novel immune-promoting therapeutics for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), such as oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (oHSV) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), have the potential to improve overall survival and lead to long-term remission, however their clinical benefit remains inconsistent. Under standard of care imaging, assessment of immunotherapeutic response can be limited by apparent radiological tumor progression associated with treatment-induced inflammation and immune infiltration. This has led to a need for better understanding of immune cell dynamics and immunotherapy response in GBM. The objective of this study is to evaluate changes in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> infiltration and its relation to therapy response, through positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, in preclinical GBM.<br \/>Methods: GSC005-luc orthotopic GBM models (n= 40) were treated with saline, M002 oHSV, anti-PD1 or combination immunotherapy following three weeks of tumor growth. One-week post-treatment, [<sup>89<\/sup>Zr]-CD8 PET imaging was performed and biologically validated through <i>ex vivo<\/i> PET, autoradiography and staining for H&#38;E and CD8 immunohistochemistry (IHC). Further, longitudinal changes in CD8 infiltration were evaluated via [<sup>89<\/sup>Zr]-CD8 PET imaging one- and three-weeks post-immunotherapy with responses monitored every three days via bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Statistical analysis involved one-way ANOVA and unpaired T-test, with p&#60;0.05 considered significant.<br \/>Results: Linear correlations were seen between <i>in vivo <\/i>PET signal and <i>ex vivo<\/i> uptake (r=0.61, p&#60;0.01), autoradiography (r=0.46, p&#60;0.01), and IHC tumor CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cell density (r=0.55, p&#60;0.01) one-week post-treatment. Immunotherapy efficacy, defined by decreased BLI signal, resembled clinical findings as only a subset of mice exhibited long-term positive response measured by BLI signal decrease (n=9\/24). Response classification revealed increased CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cell tumor localization, as measured by peak standardized uptake value (SUV<sub>peak<\/sub>) tumor to background ratio (TBR), in non-responders (p&#60;0.01) and decreased heterogeneity in signal distribution in responders (p&#60;0.05) relative to controls early in the course of therapy.<br \/>Conclusions: Early CD8 infiltration and uptake distribution from CD8-PET imaging provides potential imaging metrics of therapeutic response to oHSV immunotherapy in GBM. Development of these immune-focused imaging approaches for the assessment of positive immunotherapeutic effects in GBM is beneficial for the better understanding of immune cell dynamics and their relation to clinical outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB03-06 Imaging the immune response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PET,Cytotoxic T cell,Oncolytic virus,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Carlos  A.

While immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been the method of choice to evaluate CD8+ tumor infiltration level, the utility of the CD8-PET\/CT imaging method offers an attractive non-invasive alternative to biopsies, with the potential to account for both intra-patient tumor heterogeneity and lesion-specific response.<br \/>Methods: Using the data from ImaginAb&#8217;s phase II trial<sup>2<\/sup>, we predict response to standard of care (SOC) IoT in patients with advanced solid malignancies. Solely based on CD8-PET\/CT scan data, the novel method scores each identifiable lesion by using its volume as measured in the CT data, and mean CD8-PET uptake values before and 4 to 6 weeks after treatment start. All lesion scores are aggregated to compute the patient score, to be subsequently compared to the best standard RECIST evaluation. This methodology was defined and developed using data from 14 patients, and later evaluated using the whole cohort of 40 patients.<br \/>Results: Despite the multiplicity of indications and SOC IoT in the patient cohort, the computed scores significantly identify and stratify responders (Complete or Partial Response, mean score = -0.78, 10 subjects) from non-responders (Stable or Progressive Disease, mean score = 0.088, 25 subjects): two sample t-test value = 5.378, p-value = 1e-05. RECIST evaluations remain too preliminary to report for 4 subjects. Furthermore, CD8-PET outcomes are available much earlier (median 35 days, median best of RECIST 105 days), which may facilitate important therapy decisions. In addition, the discriminative power between the response groups is reduced when restricting the method to either of the infiltration or lesion size measurements. This result highlights the complementarity of the two measurements.<br \/>Conclusions: CD8-PET offers new non-invasive opportunities in the early discrimination of responders and non-responders to IoT as well as visualization of the heterogeneity of tumor responses to IoT, supporting its use pre-IoT and early on IoT for adult solid tumors.<br \/>Acknowledgement: All the data used in this study come from clinical study <sup>2<\/sup>.

New systemic therapies for patients with PDAC are desperately needed. Upregulation or exposure of a new protein on the tumor cell surface can serve as a therapeutic or diagnostic target. Here, we highlight our recently developed strategy to induce localization of the reticular protein calreticulin (CALR) to the cell surface in PDAC cells and its subsequent detection using a novel radiolabeled peptide.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Surface translocation of CALR was detected by flow cytometry, western blot, and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy in PDAC cells treated with either doxorubicin or gemcitabine. The radionuclide-binding chelator &#8216;DOTA&#8217; was covalently linked to a CALR-specific peptide &#8216;KLGFFKR&#8217; and then labeled with <sup>68<\/sup>Ga. Samples were analyzed on HPLC with an average radiolabeling efficiency of 93%. Mice bearing Panc02 allografts were treated with doxorubicin for 24h, injected with ~3 MBq (5 &#956;g) of radiopeptide, and sacrificed after 1 hour to determine biodistribution.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Using flow cytometry, we found that treating PDAC cells with doxorubicin or gemcitabine increased both the total number and the median fluorescence intensity of surface staining for live cells expressing CALR. When membrane proteins were isolated from PDAC cells treated with doxorubicin at various time points, a peak in surface CALR protein was detected at 30 minutes with persistent expression lasting for 24 hours. TIRF microscopy showed that Panc02 cells treated with doxorubicin had approximately a 2-fold higher surface CALR expression as detected by enhanced membrane fluorescence compared to controls. <i>In vivo<\/i>, our novel [<sup>68<\/sup>Ga]-CALR peptide showed rapid clearance through the kidneys with no significant uptake in vital organs (n=4).

Four mice groups were formed to distinguish between bispecific (Atezo-J10 in h4-1BB KI B6), monospecific PD-L1 (Atezo-J10 in B6), monospecific 4-1BB (PRS-344\/S095012 in h4-1BB KI B6), and isotype (PRS-344\/S095012 in B6) binding up to 4 days post-injection (pi). In addition, a fifth group (5 MBq <sup>89<\/sup>Zr-Atezo-J10) was studied to visualize the bispecific biodistribution up to 7 days pi. At days 1, 2, 4, or 2, 4, 7 pi, mice underwent serial PET imaging to obtain mean and maximum standardized uptake (SUVmean\/max) and retro-orbital blood sampling, followed by ex vivo biodistribution.<br \/>Results: PET imaging showed <sup>89<\/sup>Zr-Atezo-J10 specific tumor accumulation with higher tumor-to-blood ratios of respectively 2.2-, 2.6-, and 2.4-fold (p&#60;0.01) at 4 days pi compared to monospecific binding of PD-L1, 4-1BB, and isotype.

SAR444245 reduces B16-F10 tumor proliferation in C57BL\/6 mice and induces a short transient migration of CD8+ T and NK cells from peripheral blood to lymphoid organs before a strong proliferation (Ptacin et al, Nat Commun 2021). Here we report CD8+ T cells imaging post SAR444245 as monotherapy in naive and tumor bearing mice using nuclear imaging. An anti-murine CD8+ PET probe was injected in mice 24 hours post SAR444245 administration and nuclear imaging was performed at different times over 6 days. In C57BL\/6 naive and in poorly immunogenic B16-F10 tumor bearing animals, images reveal a decreased Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) within blood in treated animals at 3mg\/kg compared to control ones. In parallel, blood SUV Ratio (SUVR) increases within spleen, lymph nodes and thymus after SAR444245 injection compared to control mice. On tumor site, a stronger SUVR is measured at 144 hours post injection in SAR444245 treated group than in the control group. A dose escalation ranging from 1 to 6 mg\/kg of SAR444245 was performed in highly immunogenic CT26 tumor bearing animal. Blood SUV decreases in the treated groups compared to the control group. In lymphoid organs, all SUVR increase at 144 hours post injection in the treated groups compared to the control one. In CT26 tumors, a slight increase of the SUVR is observed for groups treated at 3 and 6 mg\/kg. In parallel, a pronounced reduction of tumor growth is observed in the treated group at 6mg\/kg.

There are currently no standardized approaches for early detection of radiation-induced cardiotoxicity as a stage that offers potential for early intervention. In this study, we employ hyperpolarized <sup>13<\/sup>C- pyruvate magnetic resonance spectroscopy to non-invasively characterize early metabolic changes in the heart in response to radiation.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We established a pre-clinical model of radiation induced heart disease (RIHD) by performing whole heart irradiation (8Gy x 5) in rats.

VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors remain a second-line or concurrent (with immunotherapy) treatment option for advanced RCC, but resistance inevitably occurs. There remains a need for biomarkers predictive of response to VEGFR targeting. Anti-VEGFR therapy-induced hypoxia can result in changes to both tumor metabolism and vascularization that contribute to the aggressiveness of treatment-resistant tumors. In this study we used <i>in vivo<\/i> hyperpolarized <sup>13<\/sup>C-tert-butanol, a freely-diffusible novel MRI tracer that provides high-SNR tissue perfusion mapping, and hyperpolarized <sup>13<\/sup>C pyruvate MRI, which enables real-time investigation of glycolytic lactate production, to understand the evolution of RCC perfusion and metabolism in response to VEGFR targeting, while correlating to histologic measures of tumor proliferation (Ki67) and vascularization (CD34). A498, a human ccRCC cell line, was implanted subcutaneously into 12-week-old nude mice. When tumors reached 15mm, the mice were placed into three arms, untreated (UT), sunitinib sensitive (SS), and sunitinib resistant (SR). SS mice were treated with sunitinib (25 mg\/kg via gavage) then the mice were imaged with MRI at 48 hours. SR mice were treated with sunitinib daily until 2mm of re-growth was detected, then MRI was performed. UT mice were imaged when tumors reached 20mm. Pimonidazole infusion immediately after MRI, then the tumors were harvested. Histology included Ki67, CD34, and pimonidazole (hypoxia) staining. Ki67 expression was greater in the UT group compared to SS (37.56&#177;5.21 vs 26.23&#177;3.78, p=0.004), but not compared to SR (37.56&#177;5.21 vs 34.32&#177;1.12, p=0.93). The UT group demonstrated greater vascularization with CD-34 vessel counting than SS (UT 6.70&#177;1.81 vs. SS 2.39&#177;1.16, p=0.002), while vascularization was increased in SR compared to SS (SR 3.82&#177;1.81 vs SS 2.39&#177;1.16, p=0.05). Ki67 expression was positively correlated with CD34 expression. MR-measured tumor perfusion of the SS group was greater than UT (0.0086&#177;0.0056 vs 0.0035&#177;0.0026, p=0.0001) and SR (0.0086&#177;0.0056 vs 0.0043&#177;0.0033, p=0.0003). Tumor lactate production in the SS group was lower than UT (0.752&#177;0.268 vs 0.609&#177;0.188, p=0.04) and SR (0.752&#177;0.268 vs 0.593&#177;0.246, p=0.006). However, tumor perfusion was negatively correlated with lactate production ratio only in the SR group. Untreated and sunitinib-resistent RCC tumors are associated with increased perfusion and vascularity, and decreased lactate production. An inverse relationship between lactate production and perfusion in SR may be attributable to vascular normalization. Analysis of the spatial relationship between tumor metabolism and perfusion will further yield additional detail on the interplay between hypoxia and metabolism.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB03-03 Imaging in animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Renal cell carcinoma,Tumor neovasculature,In vivo imaging,Therapy resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Qianhui Dou<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Patricia Coutinho de Souza<sup><\/sup>, Xiaoen Wang<sup><\/sup>, Aaron K.

Early and accurate detection is crucial in improving survival rate and quality of life of patients. Folate receptor alpha (FR&#945;) is a folate transporter that has been reported to be overexpressed in approximately 90% of ovarian cancer, which makes it a suitable molecular target to use in developing tumor imaging methods. Iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) have been used in a variety of cancer detection\/imaging applications. Here we show that anti-FR&#945; targeted superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) can be used for <i>in vivo<\/i> detection by two different imaging methods. Superparamagnetic Relaxometry (SPMR) is a highly sensitive <i>in vivo <\/i>detection technology that is able to differentiate the magnetic signature of nanoparticles bound to tumor cells from unbound nanoparticles. Same targeted SPIONs accumulated in tumor are able to provide molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast as well. Our results have shown that the anti-FR&#945; NPs can distinguish high and low FR&#945; expression cell lines, such as KB and A549, respectively in an <i>in vitro<\/i> cell based assay by SPMR, demonstrating good sensitivity, specificity and selectivity. <i>In vivo<\/i> study using xenograph model with KB and A549 cells implanted subcutaneously on the flank region of female athymic nude mice demonstrated higher level tumor accumulation of anti-FR&#945; NPs in KB tumor compared to A549 tumor, measurable by <i>ex vivo<\/i> tumor detection using SPMR. Using a PEG NPs (without the target ligand) as control for the mice study have shown that minimum nanoparticle tumor accumulated were observed, demonstrating the specificity of the nanoparticles <i>in vivo<\/i>. Organ distribution study indicated that anti-FR&#945; NPs mostly accumulated in liver and spleen as these nanoparticles were cleared through these two organs. Other organs such as brain, heart, lung, kidney didn&#8217;t show appreciable accumulation. The repeat of same type of xenograph mice model used in the SPMR study is currently under the way using MRI as an alternative <i>in vivo<\/i> detection method with images taken pre- and post- dosing of the nanoparticles. Based on the specificity and sufficient accumulation of nanoparticles demonstrated in the SPMR study, it is expected that MRI will show similar performance with additional anatomical information.Our anti-FR&#945; NPs provided targeted and specific delivery to cancerous tissue and generated measurable signal by SPMR. Furthermore, demonstration of these anti-FR&#945; NPs generating tumor specific contrast in MRI is currently under the way. These studies lay the groundwork for use of bio-safe magnetic particles as a detection and contrast agent for early ovarian cancer detection with improved accuracy to minimize the needs of invasive biopsies\/surgery as well as potential utility for monitoring therapy response or recurrence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB03-01 Advanced nanotechnology and imaging,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Imaging,Folate receptor,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Marie Zhang<sup><\/sup>, <b>Kathirvel Kandasamy<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Yamitha Perera<sup><\/sup>, Dan Inglese<sup><\/sup>, Eric Smith-Nguyen<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Imagion Biosystems, Inc., San Diego, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"21c20602-9232-4a61-9618-a32a8238e9be","ControlNumber":"4877","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

Blocks were scanned using the Bruker Skyscan 1276 microCT at a resolution of 10 &#181;m. SkyScan analysis CTAn software was utilized to prepare and analyze morphological parameters and multiple MCs contained within each block were averaged. Paired morphological parameters were compared between the benign and subsequent cancer samples within women using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Median age of patients was 53 years (range 37-77 years) at initial benign biopsy and developed breast cancer at median of 5.6 years (range: 2.3-12.8 years) later. The initial benign biopsies were for proliferative disease without atypia in the majority (59%), while 23% had non-proliferative lesions and 18% atypical hyperplasia. The average structural model index was consistent with a near rod-like shape (median 2.99, range: 2.71-3.29). Paired comparisons between benign and cancer blocks showed that the average surface area of MCs was significantly higher in the cancer samples (p=0.0467), as was the average volume of MCs (p=0.0298) (Table 1).<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Preliminarily, we demonstrate that microCT of routinely prepared pathology blocks of breast tissues may be useful in characterizing the 3-D morphometry of MCs with suggestive differences in benign and cancer tissues.

Overexpression of NOS2 correlates with other prognostic biomarkers making it a unique multifunctional oncoprotein. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) is another enzyme associated with cancer inflammation and is overexpressed in &#62;50% of breast cancers. In our previous studies, we have shown that NOS2\/COX2 co-expression is a strong predictor of poor clinical outcome and promotes CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell exclusion from tumor epithelia in Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). This observation was further explored using multiplexing proteomics technologies. Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) has revolutionized tumor microenvironment research by allowing the interrogation of over 35 protein markers simultaneously for the elucidation of the spatial distribution of immune and tumor cells at sub-cellular resolution. Herein, we used multiplex capability IMC to explore the interactions of immune and tumor cell counterparts in ER-negative and TNBC tumors. We employed Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue from 26 ER-negative and TNBC samples from a clinical cohort of African American breast cancer patients in the Baltimore MD area. We developed a panel of 15 protein metal-labeled antibody markers including antibodies targeting NOS2, COX2, T cells (CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8,) endothelium (CD31), monocytes (CD14), macrophages (CD68), basal markers (&#945;-SMA), cancer stem cells (CD44v6), cancer cells (Pan-CK, B7H4, Cadherin), and serine proteases (granzyme B) secreted by T cells or Natural Killer (NK) cells. Single section slides of 4 &#181;m size were stained with the cocktail of metal-labeled antibodies. Multiple regions of interest (ROIs) representing the tumor and immune cells compartments and tumor-facing stromal cell areas were ablated with the Hyperion Imaging system. The data analysis was performed by the Bodenmiller lab pipeline and VisioPharm software packages. Our preliminary data suggest that patient tumors with high or low NOS2\/COX2 expression showed variable levels of CD68 positive macrophage population and T cells. We are currently analyzing the remaining data to understand the cell phenotypes associated with the immunosuppressive and immune-rich clinical samples and performing neighborhood analysis of tumor cells to immune cells and vessels.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB03-04 Imaging of molecular and cellular events in the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Imaging Mass Cytometry ,Breast cancer,NOS2\/COX2 ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Milind Pore<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lisa Ridnour<sup>2<\/sup>, Paul Mallory<sup>1<\/sup>, Ashley Cardamone<sup>1<\/sup>, Stephen Lockett<sup>1<\/sup>, William Bocik<sup>1<\/sup>, David Wink<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Cancer Research Technology Program, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD,<sup>2<\/sup>Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e0dea71b-3936-49b6-98a3-0ed6d7af0b4b","ControlNumber":"2825","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

ASAP1 expression levels correlate with progression of solid tumors (e.g. breast, colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian, gastric, and prostate cancer). The first evidence for a role of ASAP1 in cancer progression was the discovery that the amplification of ASAP1 gene on chromosome 8 correlates with poor prognosis in uveal melanoma. A similar amplification of chromosome 8 has been reported in ~72% of fusion negative rhabdomyosarcoma (FN-RMS) tumors, suggesting a potential role for ASAP1 signaling in the progression of FN-RMS. To determine the function of ASAP1 in tumor growth, invasion and metastasis, we used a tongue orthotopic xenograft of FN-RMS which recapitulates physiologically relevant tumor progression and metastasis to lymph nodes and lungs, two of the common metastatic sites in patients. Using intravital microscopy, we observed that injected FN-RMS cells formed elongated structures and exhibited dynamic branching, which might represent local invasion. H&#38;E stained of fixed tissue revealed invasion into the tongue and local metastasis. Metastases to the regional lymph nodes, lower mandible and lungs were also observed. Using this system, we are now able to determine effect of knocking down and knocking out ASAP1 on the progression of the xenografts, including invasion in real time and metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB03-03 Imaging in animal models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Rhabdomyosarcoma,In vivo imaging,Tumor invasion,Tumor metastases,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sarah M.

Nanoparticles that reach and bind to the target cells are measurable by superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometers (MRX instrument developed in house), while unbound nanoparticles such as those freely circulating in the bloodstream are not detected and bone and normal tissue do not produce any magnetic signal. We have developed a protocol to produce high precision 25nm<u>+<\/u>1nm (&#60;7% dispersion) Fe<sub>3<\/sub>O<sub>4<\/sub>&nbsp;nanoparticle core. These core nanoparticles are coated by a polymer shell functionalized with carboxylate groups. Antibody are then conjugated on the surface providing molecular targeting capabilities and PEG is also attached to the surface to reduce opsonization. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that when conjugated with anti-HER2 antibody such as Herceptin, these nanoparticles exhibited great specificity and selectivity towards HER2+ tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. In current studies, we expanded our nanoparticles applications to other type of cancers, such as ovarian cancer.<br \/>The CA125 is a tissue-specific antigen expressed in ovarian cancer. It is associated with greater than 80% of epithelial ovarian neoplasms. OC125, a murine monoclonal antibody, reacts with glycosylation-dependent antigens present exclusively in the cleaved portion of the molecule. OC125 antibody is conjugated to our nanoparticles using the same strategy developed for Herceptin nanoparticles. Each nanoparticle contains one to three OC125 antibody molecules covalently attached to the surface based on ELISA analysis. Our results have shown that OC125-NP can distinguish CA125+ and CA125- cell lines, OVCAR3 and HeyA8 respectively. Positive signal can be competed out by pre-incubation with free OC125 antibody and negative cell line produce undetectable SPMR signal, demonstrating good sensitivity, specificity and selectivity.<br \/>Antigen glypican-1 (GPC1) is a proteoglycan located on cell surface composed of a membrane-associated protein core anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane. GPC1 may play a functional role in the control of cell division and growth regulation. The expression of GPC1 has been found to be elevated in many cancer cells, including ovarian. Applying the same conjugation strategy developed for Herceptin NP, humanized anti-GPC1 antibody is conjugated to the nanoparticles with minor modification. GPC1-NP generate appreciable signal using SKOV3 cell line (GPC1+ ovarian cell lines) and the signal can be competed out by the presence of excess free GPC1 antibody.<br \/>Together, these results suggest that in additional to breast cancer application, our antibody functionalized nanoparticle system can be developed for other targeted cancer detection, such as ovarian cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB03-01 Advanced nanotechnology and imaging,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,Molecular imaging,Ovarian cancer,Cancer detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Marie Zhang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, eric Smith-Nguyen<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Imagion Biosystems, Inc., San Diego, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ee9d29bc-cb49-49e9-9ebb-5b8dbc8bb8d8","ControlNumber":"5719","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

Of these deaths, the majority are due to the formation of distant metastases. While new immunotherapies have shown some success in primary tumors, their efficacy in combating metastases has been lacking. Thus we aim to investigate the hypothesis that immune responses at the metastatic site contribute to limitations of current therapies.Within the last decade, new microscopy technologies now enable real-time visualization of immune responses at primary and secondary sites. Here, we present use of these microscope technologies, along with the development of novel probes to detect apoptotic cancer cells, to investigate the success of checkpoint inhibitors in the primary and secondary sites. We validate, in multiple in vitro and in vivo assays (including intravital imaging), that fluorescent cyclic amphipathic peptide probes specifically label cells undergoing therapy-induced cancer death. In addition, we introduce a newly developed fluorescent, enzyme-activatable, chemokine-conjugate capable of targeting defined macrophage subsets in live tumors. This chemokine-conjugate exploits the high expression of chemokine receptors (e.g. CCR2) and the activity of cysteine cathepsins in tumor associated macrophages to selectively target and eradicate them without affecting other macrophages or immune cells (e.g., neutrophils, T cells, B cells). This research will help to elucidate the role of combination therapy on the metastatic foci and will provide the first insights into the benefit and limitations of combination therapy on secondary site immune responses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB03-06 Imaging the immune response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Combination therapy,In vivo imaging,Apoptosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nicole  D.
