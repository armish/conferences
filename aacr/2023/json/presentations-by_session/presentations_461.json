[{"Abstract":"[Background] Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most frequently diagnosed malignant pediatric brain tumor. Multiple integrated genomic analyses have been used to stratify MB into four molecular subgroups, each unique in its gene expression profile, clinical characteristics, and prognosis. <i>MYC<\/i>-driven group 3 MB (G3MB) tumors are poorly understood entities, defined by metastasis down the leptomeninges, disease recurrence and particularly poor survival. <i>There is hence an urgent need for a more thorough molecular understanding of G3MB, particularly at recurrence, in order to develop more effective therapeutic modalities that will improve the durability of remission. <\/i><br \/>[Methods] We previously developed a therapy-adapted mouse model of G3MB disease progression from xenoengraftment through treatment-induced minimal residual disease until eventual relapse in the brain and spine compartments. Temporal transcriptomic profiling of tumor tissue at each stage revealed an enrichment of several metabolic pathways at recurrence. Here we mapped further functional insight into the G3MB metabologenomic landscape by performing a genome-wide loss-of-function CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screen in patient-derived G3MB cells, which we cross-referenced with screens performed in human neural stem cells (NSCs), the proposed cell- of-origin for G3MB.<br \/>[Results] By examining G3MB context-specific gene ontologies, we discovered differential essentiality of several metabolic processes exclusively in G3MB. In tandem, mass spectrometry-based global metabolomic profiling shows dysregulation of several metabolic pathways in in G3MB tumor cells in comparison to NSC, including the enrichment of <i>de novo <\/i>pyrimidine biosynthesis and depletion of salvage pyrimidine intermediates. We investigated a lead hit from our screen, DHODH (dihydroorotate dehydrogenase), which facilitates <i>de novo <\/i>pyrimidine biosynthesis. Our data demonstrate that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of DHODH selectively targets G3MB brain tumor initiating cell (BTIC) activity while sparing normal NSC, by disrupting hallmark MYC activity. We further show that MYC-amplified G3MB tumors harbor subgroup-specific transcriptomic signatures that delineate enrichment of <i>de novo<\/i> pyrimidine biosynthesis.<br \/>[Significance] Despite clear evidence favoring an altered metabolic landscape in <i>MYC<\/i>-driven cancers, there have been only a few reports into the role of metabolic reprogramming in <i>MYC<\/i>-amplified G3MB. Given the paucity of treatment options for patients with recurrent G3MB, this study has the potential for a significant impact on the field of pediatric oncology. Translation of therapies that target unique metabolic vulnerabilities exclusive to G3MB may lead to more durable cures and radical improvements in quality of life for survivors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Metabolomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Medulloblastoma,CRISPR-cas9 Screening,Metabolomics,DHODH,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>William  D.

Knowledge of these tumors is limited, and a lack of targetable genomic drivers means patients have few treatment options. To provide a detailed analysis on the influence of genomic alterations to proteome-level changes in SCC, we previously integrated DNA copy number, somatic mutations, RNA-sequencing, and expression proteomics in a cohort of 108 SCC patients. A major finding was identification of three proteomic subtypes, two of which made up the majority (87%) of tumors: the &#8220;Inflamed&#8221; subtype was enriched for B-cell rich tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), and the &#8220;Redox&#8221; subtype was enriched for redox pathways and NFE2L2\/KEAP1 alterations but had significantly less immune infiltration. We hypothesized these proteomic subtypes would give rise to distinct metabolic signatures. Therefore, we performed untargeted metabolomics on 87 tumors from the same cohort using chromatographic separation on a HILIC column, followed by analysis on a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer. This analysis yielded 7,344 features corresponding to 7,072 unannotated metabolites and 272 identified metabolites. Glutathione, a key redox metabolite, was anticorrelated with immune score (R = -0.44, padj = 0.004) calculated from our transcriptomic data with the ESTIMATE algorithm, and glutathione was elevated in the Redox proteomic subtype (0.58 log2 ratio, padj = 9.87E-04). Consensus clustering was next used to identify novel metabolomic subtypes of SCC. Surprisingly, none of the five metabolomic subtypes we identified corresponded to proteomic subtype or NFE2L2\/KEAP1 alteration (Fisher&#8217;s Exact test p-values &#62; 0.05). The fifth subtype had 332 metabolites (26 identified) differentially expressed (&#62; 1.5 fold-change, padj &#60; 0.05) with ascorbate and aldarate metabolism as the top enriched pathway (padj = 3.36E-04). Interestingly, this fifth metabolomic subtype had significantly higher DNp63-alpha (p = 2.40E-05), a primary transcript of delta-N p63 that is known to promote non-small cell lung cancer. Ongoing integrative analyses across omic types will determine how p53, p63, and p73 transcripts influence these metabolomic subtypes, how these transcripts relate to the poor immune infiltration in some SCC tumors, and if these transcripts relate to novel metabolic vulnerabilities in SCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Metabolomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Multiomics,Metabolomics,Squamous cell carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Paul Stewart<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ashley Lui<sup>2<\/sup>, Eric Welsh<sup>2<\/sup>, Dalia Ercan<sup>2<\/sup>, Vanessa Rubio<sup>2<\/sup>, Hayley Ackerman<sup>2<\/sup>, Guohui Li<sup>3<\/sup>, Bin Fang<sup>2<\/sup>, Steven Eschrich<sup>2<\/sup>, John Koomen<sup>2<\/sup>, Elsa Flores<sup>2<\/sup>, Eric Haura<sup>2<\/sup>, Gina DeNicola<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL,<sup>2<\/sup>Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL,<sup>3<\/sup>Zymergen, Emeryville, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cec0ff42-dd4a-4e1e-ac85-34e674030923","ControlNumber":"5296","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

NRF2 activation exerts pro-tumoral effects in part by altering cancer cell metabolism. We previously reported a novel mechanism of NRF2 tumoral immune suppression through selective upregulation of the tryptophan metabolizing enzyme kynureninase (KYNU) in lung adenocarcinoma. In the current study, we explored the Pan-Cancer relevance of NRF2-mediated KYNU upregulation. We analyzed the gene expression dataset for 9,801 tumors representing 32 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Elevated KYNU expression levels paralleled increased gene-based signatures of NRF2-activation and was strongly associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, marked by high expression of gene-based signatures of Tregs as well as immune checkpoint blockade-related genes CD274 (PDL-1), PDCD1 (PD-1), and CTLA4, regardless of cancer type. Cox proportional hazard models further revealed that increased tumoral KYNU gene expression was prognostic for poor overall survival in several cancer types, including thymoma, acute myeloid leukemia, low grade glioma, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Using PDAC as a model system, we confirmed that siRNA-mediated knockdown of NRF2 reduces KYNU mRNA expression, whereas activation of <i>NFE2L2 <\/i>(the encoding gene for NRF2) through either small molecule agonists or siRNA-mediated knockdown of <i>KEAP1 <\/i>upregulated KYNU. Metabolomic analyses of conditioned media from PDAC cell lines revealed elevated levels of KYNU-derived anthranilate, confirming KYNU as enzymatically functional. Collectively, our findings highlight the multi-cancer relevance of the NRF2-KYNU axis and of tumoral KYNU as a prognostic marker of poor overall survival associated with immunosuppression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Metabolomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nrf2,KYNU,Immune Suppression,Prognostic Marker,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ricardo  A.

The response to chemotherapy is substantially influenced by the high metabolic flexibility of ovarian cancer cells, which allows the cells to reprogram their metabolism and survive the treatment. Better understanding mechanisms regulating ovarian tumor metabolism could be exploited to develop new improved therapies. Our work demonstrated that the upregulation of mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDHA) is particularly prevalent (~20% of patients) in ovarian carcinoma and contributes to high energy tumor metabolism and cell survival. We observed that SDHA overexpressing ovarian cancer cells showed improved ability to survive and generate colonies in anchorage-independent conditions, which is an important feature of ovarian tumor cells surviving and spreading in peritoneal fluid (ascites). Proteomics data revealed that the SDHA overexpressing tumor cells showed reduced levels of proteins promoting anaerobic glycolysis (LDHA and HIF1&#945;), and increased levels of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) proteins. In addition, our tracer-based metabolomics data revealed that the elevated SDHA stimulates glutaminolysis by increasing mitochondrial glutamine supply fueling the TCA cycle with essential metabolites. We also demonstrated that the overexpression of SDHA is associated with a significant increase of OXPHOS and ATP production rate. Further, we reasoned that the SDHA overexpressing tumor cells could be particularly vulnerable to drugs disrupting glucose and\/or glutamine metabolism. We performed a drug screening and identified an anti-metabolic compound shikonin known to disrupt glucose and amino acid metabolism. In <i>in vitro<\/i> studies, shikonin exhibited a profound anti-tumor efficacy and selectivity towards SDHA overexpressing tumor cells superior to that observed with chemotherapy. Importantly, our <i>in vivo<\/i> study validated the <i>in vitro<\/i> observations, and showed that shikonin is highly effective in suppressing SDHA overexpressing patient-derived tumor growth. In summary, the unique metabolic state of ovarian cancer associated with SDHA amplification could be successfully targetable offering a potential new treatment strategy for ovarian cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Metabolism,Targeted therapy,Proteomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Lin Wang<sup><\/sup>, Magdalena Bulicz<sup><\/sup>, Patryk Mucha<sup><\/sup>, Michael Kinter<sup><\/sup>, Atul Pranay<sup><\/sup>, Timothy  M.

Based on this specific tumor need, efforts have been made to target the glutamine metabolism using glutaminase inhibitors. In this study, we present in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrating activities and target engagement of a new specific GLS1 allosteric inhibitor (RA123). In vitro, RA123 was tested in imid-resistant, CD38 low RPMI8226 multiple myeloma cell line using the ATP Cell titer Glo assay over a 72h treatment period. In vivo, RA123 was tested in mice xenografted with RPMI8226 multiple myeloma cell line. Compound was given at three different under a BID (twice a day) regimen. Tumor growth under treatment was monitored by caliper measurement for 20 days. A terminal PK\/PD study on the same model was setup measuring impact of the drug on the glutamine and glutamate tumor content post 24 hours after the last administration. Over the same period, PK measurements were planned to document drug exposure in the plasma and in the tumor. Finally, in a stand-alone study, target engagement was documented using imaging modality. [18F]FSPG PET radiotracer was used to visualize and quantify impact of RA123 on tumor (RPMI8226) glutamate pool. RA123 was given at three doses under a BID regimen. Treatment was administered for 3 days, and PET signal was recorded at baseline and at end of day 3. In vitro study demonstrated that RA123 was able to induce cell killing of RPMI8226 after 72 hours of treatment. These data translated in vivo by a dose-dependent effect on cell growth. In a terminal PK\/PD study, RA123 confirmed a dose-dependent impact on glutamine and glutamate tumor levels which correlated with both plasma and tumor exposure. Further confirmation of target engagement was observed with reduced PET uptake post- RA123 treatment at the three doses tested. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that RA123, a new specific GLS1 allosteric inhibitor was able to impact multiple myeloma tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. This effect was associated with reduced glutamate pools and accumulation of glutamine levels within the tumor cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glutamine metabolism,Multiple myeloma,Small molecule inhibitor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Christophe Henry<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Dimitri Gorge-Bernat<sup>1<\/sup>, Pascal Pannier<sup>1<\/sup>, Isabelle Meaux<sup>1<\/sup>, Jane Cheng<sup>2<\/sup>, Fangxian Sun<sup>2<\/sup>, Olivier Pasquier<sup>1<\/sup>, Philippe Lienard<sup>1<\/sup>, Erwan Jouannot<sup>1<\/sup>, Thierry Gouyon<sup>1<\/sup>, Geneviève Estenne-Bouhtou<sup>1<\/sup>, Bailin Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Bérangère Thiers<sup>1<\/sup>, Laurent Debussche<sup>1<\/sup>, David Machnik<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Sanofi, Vitry-sur-Seine, France,<sup>2<\/sup>Sanofi, Cambridge, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f19b2d31-3464-4414-a00c-1f229fb45a6a","ControlNumber":"4642","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;C.

Extracellular low pH activates metalloproteases and intracellular high pH activates ATP citrate lyase, inactivates caspases, etc. Hydrogen ions attracted to inner membrane fixed anions are putatively displaced by potassium ion flow through membrane channels. Altered expression of potassium channel (KCN) genes sensitive to pH in invasive brain tumors (Beckner, Proc AACR, A3039, 2022) and 2 mutated KCN genes (1 pH sensitive) in U87 glioblastoma cells (Clark MJ et al, PLOS Genet 2010, e1000832) led to this investigation. Published studies with altered expression or mutations in KCN genes qualifying them as genes of interest (GOI) were compared. Both study types included breast, lung, gastrointestinal, brain, bone marrow, liver, melanocytic malignancies, and 8 others were in either. At least 1 figure (heatmap, Venn diagram, phylogenetic tree, etc.) or table (not Supplemental) had 1 or more KCN genes in a group of GOI. Average numbers of GOI with 95% CI for 23 expression and 14 mutation studies were 38.5 &#177; 0.4 and 28.4 &#177; 0.4. No KCN GOI was further examined in the studies. Expression was according to tumor types, inhibitors, siRNAs, regulators of pathways, transcription factors, location, etc. Mutations were single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions, deletions, fusions, etc. Tissue from surgery, organoids, xenografts, cell lines, stem cells, etc. were analyzed. Of 27 KCN GOI in expression studies, 2\/3 were detected with other KCN GOI. For 12 mutated KCN genes there were no other KCN genes mutated in the same study.

In expression studies, 8 found pH sensitive KCN GOI including KCNK1 (2X), K3, K5, K6, K12, K15 (2X), and KCNJ16. In mutation studies, KCNK9 was the only one found. The most frequently mutated KCN subfamily was KCNJ, KCNJ5 (2X) and KCNJ12 (2X). All expression studies included at least 1 repeat GOI (KCN or other). APOE, RET, and RTN1 were each GOI 3 times. Additionally, 40 expressed GOI (including 6 KCN GOI) were found 2X. A small cell lung cancer study had 6 repeats (30%) in 20 GOI (ASCL1, BCL2, KCNA1, RET, SCN3A, and SOX2). KCN gene multiplicity, often pH sensitive members, among low to mid level GOI consistent with a Goldilocks' level of expression, and repeated association with cancer genes supports a pH related measured\/regulated role for potassium channels in malignancy. Mainly inward (and some outward for recirculation) potassium transmembrane flows in tumor cells potentially compete with hydrogen ions attracted to inner membrane anions to promote proton efflux by displacement with subsequent reversed pH gradients that aid invasion, cell survival, etc.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Invasiveness,Potassium ion channels,Expression analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Marie E.

About 30% of these patients return to clinic with recurrent prostate cancer that initially responds to androgen ablation therapy (ADT). Unfortunately, almost all of them fail ADT and develop castrate resistant disease (CRPC) that responds poorly to most cancer therapies and progress to often lethal metastatic CRPC (mCRPC). There are accumulating evidence that at a certain state of progression of hormone sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) to CRPC, prostate cancer cells adopt to androgen signaling axis targeted therapy (ASI) by switching their metabolism from glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). High OXPHOS activity induces mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagy, cancer invasion, and metastasis. A mitochondrial enzyme glutaminase (GLS) produces L-glutamate from L-glutamine. L-glutamate is utilized in mitochondrial metabolism for energy production through TCA cycle. GLS inhibitors CB-839 and IACS-6274 are being clinically developed for treatment of various human malignancies. We have shown that growth of prostate cancer patient derived xenografts (PDX) is markedly inhibited by a combination treatment of a clinically used ASI enzalutamide (ENZA) followed by a GLS inhibitor.<br \/>Methods: We followed the growth of one HSPC and two CRPC PDX tumors in mice and collected tumor tissues and circulating human tumor cells (CTC) from mouse blood samples at sacrifice. We used super resolution STED confocal microscopy to image mitochondria in the tissue samples and in the CTCs, desorption ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) imaging of multiple metabolites in the tissue samples as well as hyperpolarized MRI (HP-MRI) of the xenografted tumors to follow the changes in cellular central carbon metabolism <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Results: We observed that growth of PDXs developing ENZA resistance is markedly inhibited when ENZA is followed by adding GLS inhibitors with a concomitant reduction in OXPHOS activity. In addition, the <i>ex vivo <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i> methods introduced to monitor tumor metabolic activities can be easily translated into clinic to monitor the metabolic status of the tumors for early detection of resistance development and as a pharmacodynamic marker for metabolic inhibitor therapy.<br \/>Conclusion: GLS inhibitors added to ASI could be effective against CRPC and mCRPC developing resistance to ASI treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitochondria,Metabolism,Inhibitors,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hirak Subhra Basu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Meredith Spradlin<sup>2<\/sup>, Tian Weihua<sup>1<\/sup>, Jose Enriquez<sup>1<\/sup>, Pratip Bhattacharya<sup>1<\/sup>, Livia Eberlin<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Surgery, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX,<sup>3<\/sup>Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"fe6e1d19-5a7c-4f85-8b4e-2e85c13babbb","ControlNumber":"3610","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

The increased glucose dependence of cancer cells, also known as the Warburg effect, opens the possibility to therapeutically target the glycolytic pathway and challenge the metabolic needs of tumor cells. We generated 24 monoclonal antibodies targeting the main glucose transporter on cancer cells - SLC2A1 (GLUT1). We evaluated the ability of the antibodies to affect cancer cell fitness alone and in combination with OXPHOS inhibitors to find clinically applicable therapeutics targeting tumor metabolism.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Immunization, discovery and isolation of monoclonal antibodies against SLC2A1 protein was conducted using HybriFree technology using SLC2A1<sup>+ <\/sup>virus like particle (VLP)-based immunization strategy (Kivi, et al., BMC Biotechnology, 2016). Antibodies were functionally characterized by 2-deoxyglucose uptake interference assay and sensitivity to antibody single and combination treatments were evaluated in various tumor cell lines. Metabolomics and oxygen consumption rates were examined as mechanistic endpoints for tumor cell lines and primary tumor samples.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> The anti-SLC2A1 antibodies specifically bind to SLC2A1 with low nanomolar EC50 values and not to other glucose transporters. Antibody clones with functional properties inhibit glucose uptake leading to reduced metabolic activity and growth inhibition in a subset of cancer cell lines. A drastic cell proliferation inhibition is moreover observed in combination of anti-SLC2A1 antibodies and OXPHOS inhibitors metformin, phenformin or IACS-010759 in 2D cultures of colon, breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines. The inhibition of metabolic activity was further confirmed in an <i>ex vivo<\/i> primary patient tissue samples highlighting the putative translational applicability of our antibodies.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> This is the first study to provide highly specific antibodies bocking the function of SLC2A1 transporter and demonstrate the proof of principle for inhibiting complex muti-pass membrane transporters with antibody therapeutics. While the developed anti-SLC2A1 antibodies could be efficacious in some indications as single agents, appreciable clinical activity could be obtained by the combined use with OXPHOS inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Glucose metabolism,Antibody,Cancer therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Siret Tahk<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kai Virumäe<sup>1<\/sup>, Paule Hermet<sup>1<\/sup>, Korneelia Anton<sup>1<\/sup>, Maiken Abel<sup>1<\/sup>, Denis Belitškin<sup>1<\/sup>, Luciano Galdieri<sup>2<\/sup>, Steven Garner<sup>2<\/sup>, Jillian Krings<sup>2<\/sup>, Kaleb Collver<sup>2<\/sup>, Emily Hoehn<sup>2<\/sup>, Brendan Lahm<sup>2<\/sup>, Kaitlyne Powers<sup>2<\/sup>, Tuuli Käämbre<sup>3<\/sup>, Alastair J.

However, the collateral effect of these, i.e., deletion of essential genes or upregulation of metabolic regulators, exposes cancers to biological pressures by suppressing essential metabolic pathways. Cancer cells rely on paralogous metabolic pathways to compensate for this loss of function, which in turn opens the door to exploit metabolic vulnerabilities arising as a direct consequence of chromosomal alterations. These pathways are collateral lethal (CL) targets and offer a unique precision medicine approach for metabolic therapeutics. We have developed an integrated machine learning and systems biology platform, collateral lethal gene identification via metabolic fluxes (CLIM) to identify metabolic targets across multiple cancers. <u>Results:<\/u> In ovarian cancers with 19p13.3 deletion, a loss of Complex III subunit-encoding gene UQCR11 occurs, leading to suppressed electron transport chain (ETC) activity. CLIM predicted that MTHFD2 acts noncanonically to oxidize NADH to NAD<sup>+<\/sup> to compensate for reduced NAD<sup>+<\/sup> recycling via the ETC. We demonstrate selective death of ETC deficient ovarian cancers by targeting MTHFD2 and provide mechanistic validation of oxidative MTHFD2 flux. We observed significant shrinkage of ovarian tumors with ETC deficiency upon MTHFD2 knockdown in mouse models. In triple negative breast cancers (TNBC), we discovered a chromosomal amplification leading to reprogramming of the serine biosynthesis pathway. CLIM predicts a target in the tryptophan metabolism. <u>Methods:<\/u> Patients are stratified using machine learning to identify tumors with distinct chromosomal alterations. Multiobjective metabolic flux analysis is employed to predict CL pathways in curated genome-scale metabolic models. Validation of metabolic rewiring predicted by CLIM were examined using 3-<sup>2<\/sup>H-glucose, 4-<sup>2<\/sup>H-glucose and 2,3,3-<sup>2<\/sup>H-serine to probe the one carbon metabolism. Oxidative MTHFD2 flux was quantified using innovative combinatorial tracer study with <sup>2<\/sup>H-formate and 4-<sup>2<\/sup>H-glucose. We utilized gain- and loss-of-function assays in multiple cell-lines to show utility of the predicted CL targets in TNBCs with chromosomal amplifications. <u>Conclusion:<\/u> Our integrated platform successfully identifies CL gene pairs to decipher novel metabolic targets specific to chromosomal alterations across many cancer types. Importantly, targets identified by CLIM are based on quantitative flux analysis. This approach reveals functional connection between CL pairs, thereby providing a mechanistic understanding of emerging lethality. This is critical in developing therapeutic interventions that selectively target cancer cells, with minimal off-target or side effects.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Machine Learning,Metabolic Flux Analysis,Systems Biology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Abhinav Achreja<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jin Heon Jeon<sup>1<\/sup>, Mark Slayton<sup>1<\/sup>, Tao Yu<sup>2<\/sup>, Olamide Animasahun<sup>1<\/sup>, Minal Nenwani<sup>1<\/sup>, Fulei Wuchu<sup>1<\/sup>, Anjali Mittal<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiongbin Lu<sup>2<\/sup>, Sofia  D.

Here we present evidence that the knockdown of KDM2B in basal-like breast cancer cell lines results in a decrease of Glutathione (GSH) levels, a secondary increase of intracellular ROS levels and in enhanced sensitivity to deubiquitinase inhibitors. The expression of the Glutamate-Cystine antiporter, the Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase GCLC\/GCLM and the Glutathione Peroxidase GPX4, all of which regulate GSH abundance was not affected. To address the mechanism of the GSH regulation we carried out RNA-Seq, quantitative proteomics and metabolomics analyses in shKDM2B- and empty vector-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells. The results showed that the KD of KDM2B causes major shifts in metabolism and that one of the metabolic pathways whose activity depends on KDM2B is the SGOC pathway, which has a major role in GSH biosynthesis. Experiments in cultured cells confirmed the importance of KDM2B in the regulation of this pathway and they also showed that the inhibition of the pathway via the KD of KDM2B is partly responsible for the shKDM2B-induced inhibition of cell proliferation in culture and in xenograft experiments in NSG mice. More important, the transcriptomic signature of the SGOC pathway correlates with the expression of KDM2B in basal like mammary adenocarcinomas in the TCGA database. The genes encoding the majority of the enzymes in the SGOC pathway are known to be regulated by MYC and ATF4 and our data show that both MYC and ATF4 are under the regulatory control of KDM2B. ATAC-Seq and ChIP-Seq experiments in shKDM2B and control MDA-MB-231 cells also showed that KDM2B binds the promoter region of not only MYC and ATF4, but also of the genes encoding the SGOC enzymes and that it regulates chromatin accessibility and the abundance of H3K4me3\/H3K27Ac active histone marks in these promoters. Overall, our data indicate that KDM2B regulates the SGOC pathway by targeting MYC and ATF4 and by making the promoters of the genes encoding the SGOC enzymes accessible to these regulators. Overall, our data provide new evidence on SGOC regulation, and identify novel KDM2B-dependent metabolic vulnerabilities in basal like breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"c-Myc,Breast cancer,Epigenetics,Cancer metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Evangelia Chavdoula<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Vollter Anastas<sup>1<\/sup>, Allesandro La Ferlita<sup>1<\/sup>, Julian Aldana<sup>1<\/sup>, Giuseppe Carota<sup>2<\/sup>, Mariarita Spampinato<sup>2<\/sup>, Sameer Parashar<sup>1<\/sup>, Ilaria Cosentini<sup>3<\/sup>, Burak Soysal<sup>1<\/sup>, Giovanni Nigita<sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Freitas<sup>1<\/sup>, Philip Tsichlis<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, OH,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Biomedical and Biotechnological Sciences, University of Catania, Catania, Italy,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Bioinformatics Unit, University of Catania, Catania, Catania, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6ad01be9-0645-4bbb-a23e-68d2d700e655","ControlNumber":"7552","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>E.

We have previously shown that the ELOVL family members ELOVL2, 5, and 7 are Androgen Receptor (AR)-regulated proteins; and that ELOVL5 is overexpressed in both primary and castration-resistant prostate cancer. To confirm the role of ELOVL5 activity in prostate carcinogenesis, we generated genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) with deletion of <i>Elovl5<\/i>, validated by immunohistochemistry, in combination with the overexpression of c-Myc, an oncogene known to affect lipid metabolism in cancer cells. As expected, we observed alterations in the lipid profile of the murine prostate with the partial deletion of <i>Elovl5<\/i>, as determined by a significant reduction in levels of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) with long-chain fatty acids (22 carbons) and increased levels of PE with short-chain fatty acids (14 carbons), suggesting an overall shortening on acyl chains of the most common phospholipid species. Interestingly, we also observed that the heterozygous deletion of <i>Elovl5 <\/i>reduced the expression levels of the AR on the anterior lobe of the murine prostate, in comparison to tissue from <i>Elovl5<\/i> wild type mice. Preliminary data also indicates a modulation in prostate volume when <i>Elovl5 <\/i>is genetically deleted in comparison to tissue from wild type mice. Heterozygous <i>Elovl5 <\/i>deletion did not affect healthy tissue.To explore biological effects, we generated a 3D organoid line derived from the prostate of mice with homozygous deletion of <i>Elovl5 <\/i>and overexpression of c-Myc. We found that <i>Elovl5 knock-out <\/i>decreased organoid diameter and proliferation of c-Myc-driven cells compared to<i> Elovl5 WT<\/i>.

Cancer stem cell-induced chemoresistance and tumor metastasis accounts for treatment failure and recurrence in NSCLC. Additionally, the up-regulated glycosaminoglycan-chondroitin sulfate (CS) biosynthesis pathway contributes to the mesenchymal state of lung cancer and related to unfavorable prognosis. Previously, we found carbohydrate sulfotransferase 11 (CHST11), a key CS biosynthetic enzyme, was associated with tumor progression and metastasis in NSCLC as well as lung fibrosis. Furthermore, ceruloplasmin (CP) acted as a downstream effector of CHST11 through interferon-&#947; signaling pathway stimulation and increased NSCLC metastatic features. However, the linkage between metabolic dysregulation and NSCLC stemness remains unclear. Here, we found not only overexpression of CHST11 but also CS-A treatment, the metabolite of CHST11, promoted NSCLC tumor sphere formation, the expression of cancer stemness markers, and transcriptional activities of stemness-related pathways. Iron was a necessary ion in upregulating cancer stemness properties such as tumor-initiation, metastasis and chemoresistance. We found both CHST11 and iron enhanced NSCLC tumorigenesis. Moreover, iron chelation disrupted CHST11-CP axis induced-stemness. The combination of iron chelator with chemotherapies showed the synergistic effect on antitumor as well as anti-cancer stemness and further promoted apoptosis. Our findings implicate that the CHST11-CP-iron axis facilitates tumor progression and cancer stemness in NSCLC. A regimen that combines an iron chelator and chemotherapies targeting cancer stem cells will benefit for not only preventing NSCLC tumorigenesis but cancer recurrence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer metabolism,Stemness,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Li-Jie Li<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Wei-Min Chang<sup>2<\/sup>, Michael Hsiao<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan,<sup>2<\/sup>School of Oral Hygiene, College of Oral Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4603c6fe-3d7f-4765-b256-76360d8524b7","ControlNumber":"6325","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

Transcriptomic, genomic, and epigenomic insights have stratified these tumors into four distinct subtypes: SHH, WNT, Group 3 and Group 4. Of the four subtypes, Group 3 tumors bear the worst prognosis. Each MB subtype is distinguished by their unique transcriptome profile and epigenetic landscape. Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer and allows cells to actively promote the utilization of nutrients to support their uncontrolled proliferation. We identified distinct transcriptional metabolic profiles in medulloblastomas. We found that Group 3 MB show upregulation of key anabolic pathways. We then cross-referenced these data from comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing profiles of cerebellar developmental niches. We found that Group 3 MB exhibits metabolic signature similar that of early progenitors, rhombic lip progenitors, and cerebellar ventricular zone derivatives. Finally, we identify DLAT, the E2 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, as a uniquely upregulated gene in Group 3 MB. Knockdown of DLAT inhibited tumor growth in-vitro and in-vivo suggesting a potential targets for future therapeutic regimens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Epigenetics,Medulloblastoma,Glucose metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Derek Dang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kyle  S.

The presence of BM portends an extremely poor prognosis even when extracranial disease is controlled and remains a major clinical problem. To date, there are no BM-specific targeted therapies available. MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that, upon binding hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), mediates proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. The MET pathway has emerged as a targetable oncogenic driver of NSCLC BM; however, almost half of patients with <i>MET<\/i> alterations fail to respond to MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Interestingly, we identified a significant enrichment of <i>MET<\/i> amplification in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) BM (16%) compared to primary LUAD (3%) or liver metastases (5%). Subsequent RNA-sequencing and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of <i>MET<\/i>-amplified and non-<i>MET<\/i> amplified LUAD BM identified many dysregulated pathways including those involved in cellular metabolism. In contrast to previous reports in melanoma which found that oxidative phosphorylation was the dominant metabolic pathway in BM, we found that genes involved in glycolysis and glutamine catabolism were increased in the high MET expressing cell lines compared to low MET expressing cell lines. We confirmed glycolytic pathway up-regulation by evaluating the activity of hexokinase 1 and 2 (HK1, HK2), glutaminase (GLS), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) in a <i>MET<\/i>-amplified metastatic line (H1993) compared to a <i>MET<\/i> wild-type NSCLC cell line (H2073) derived from the same patient. Further, bioenergetic analysis revealed that H1993 cells were more metabolically active, generated higher levels of ATP, and exhibited increased glycolysis compared to H2073 cells. The enhanced metabolic activity of H1993 cells increased their susceptibility to glucose deprivation and metabolic inhibitors, supporting that metabolic reprogramming is important for MET-driven disease. Additionally, untargeted metabolomics of <i>MET<\/i> amplified compared to non-<i>MET<\/i> amplified cells identified alterations in numerous amino acid catabolism pathways, including glutathione biosynthesis among other novel pathways. Treatment with the MET TKI capmatinib similarly reduced glycolysis-associated gene expression, oxygen consumption, extracellular acidification, and amino acid catabolism generating a metabolic phenotype more comparable to non-<i>MET<\/i> amplified NSCLC. Together, our data show <i>MET<\/i>-amplified NSCLC BM undergo metabolic reprogramming, which can be inhibited to suppress tumor growth. Current and future experiments are exploring whether we can specifically target <i>MET<\/i> altered BM with glycolytic inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,NSCLC,Brain metastasis,Glycolysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kasey  R.

Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is a mitochondrial deacetylase that modulates ROS levels and governs many enzymes that regulate mitochondrial metabolism and homeostasis. SIRT3 has a dual role in cancer; it is regarded as an oncogene and tumor suppressor gene simultaneously. It has tumor-promoting action via keeping ROS levels low and favoring cell proliferation; on the contrary, it can trigger cell death under stress conditions by modulating tumor cell glycolysis. Recent data suggest a role for SIRT3 in cancer immunology with PD-L1 levels are found to be inversely associated with SIRT3 level in cervical cancer, and CD8+ T cells from SIRT3 knockout donor mice exhibited low GVHD in recipients. In this study, we explored the potential role of SIRT3 agonists in sensitizing the immunoreactivity of melanoma cells in a novel immunoreactive melanoma organoids model. We used the B16-F10 melanoma cell line spheroids to determine the effects of SIRT3 agonists on cellular viability, using an ATP assay. Validation of SIRT3 expression was determined via Western blot. Non-toxic amounts of SIRT3 agonists were also applied to melanoma organoids prepared from patient-derived metastatic melanoma from a lymph node. Preliminary results revealed a significant decrease in the viability of the organoids treated with R-propranolol (20&#181;M) and Imipramine blue (0.25&#181;M) agonists. We further investigated the effect of SIRT3 agonists R-propranolol and Imipramine blue on immunotherapy targeting PD-1, Pembrolizumab (100 nM) and Nivolumab (100 nM), and CTLA-4 inhibitor Ipilimumab (100 nM). We found a limited effect of Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab. Anti-tumor cytotoxicity was markedly increased in combination of Imipramine blue with Pembrolizumab and R-propranolol with Nivolumab. We propose that these effects are mediated through the activation of the endogenous immune cells and\/or via the regulation of the PD-L1 and NKD2 ligand expression levels in the melanoma cells to become more sensitized to immune cells. Further studies will aim to validate these results in immunoreactive organoids from both mice and human patients. Our studies will shed light on the immune and metabolic axes and the use of specific agonists to develop new immune therapy treatment strategies for melanoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Organoids,Sirtuins,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Azza  M.

We observed the survival of a small percentage of HCT116 cells under glucose starvation. We hypothesized that these cells represent a previously undescribed subpopulation able to adjust their metabolism in the absence of glucose. Here we aimed to characterize the metabolic and molecular properties allowing these cells to survive. We propagated individual clones from HCT116 cells and further analyzed a single clone descendants were able to survive glucose starvation. Biochemical and molecular analyses were performed under standard glucose conditions, under glucose starvation during adaptation period, and under glucose starvation after resumption of proliferation. Metabolic analysis by Seahorse revealed that surviving cells completely shifted their metabolism from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation. LC-MS metabolomics analysis revealed that during senescence-like adaptation the cells accumulate metabolites required for NAD synthesis. FAD, a co-factor involved in the TCA cycle, was not found in the dormant cells, while higher levels of carnosine, essential for ROS elimination, were observed. The metabolic shift toward enhanced oxidative phosphorylation was accompanied by increased production of ROS leading to DNA damage, reflected in an upregulation of the genes NUPR, ST6GAL1, and EGRF as observed by RNAseq. Cells that resumed proliferation were also characterized by enhanced expression of DNA damage repair genes and upregulated subunits of ATP-synthase, a key enzyme in oxidative phosphorylation. We suggest that cells predisposed to effective DNA repair have more time and capabilities to adjust their metabolism and to survive.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colon cancer,Glucose metabolism,Oxidative DNA damage,Heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Elimelech Nesher<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Bar Levi<sup>2<\/sup>, Hadas Levy<sup>2<\/sup>, Raichel Cohen-Harazi<sup>2<\/sup>, Igor Koman<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Ariel University, Ari'el, Israel,<sup>2<\/sup>Molecular Biology, Ariel University, Ari'el, Israel","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9dfb4c1b-61f0-404f-af0f-88edebd9c1d4","ControlNumber":"4667","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>E.

Although most cancer cells can convert homocysteine to methionine, they are unable to grow when methionine depleted media is supplemented with homocysteine. In contrast, non-tumorigenic cells proliferate well in homocysteine media. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that cancer cells cultured in homocysteine medium increase metabolic flux towards the transsulfuration pathway, away from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthesis resulting in overall reduced methylation potential. We have shown that methionine sensing occurs independently of the mTOR pathway, which is known to link amino acid abundance and cell growth. Instead, our results suggest that Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) methylation is sensitive to changes in the SAM\/SAH ratio. Reduced PP2A methylation correlates with reduced cell proliferation in homocysteine medium. Furthermore, overexpression of the PP2A demethylase Pme1 forcibly reduces PP2A methylation and induces methionine dependence in cells that normally proliferate in homocysteine medium. These findings suggest a model that links methionine metabolism to cell cycle progression via regulation of PP2A methylation. Here we use quantitative proteomics to define changes in B-subunit binding to PP2A during methionine starvation to investigate the molecular mechanism of this methionine dependence seen in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Pathway,Methylation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anna Andronicos<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Da-Wei Lin<sup><\/sup>, Yi-Chen Su<sup><\/sup>, Mari Ishak Gabra<sup><\/sup>, Mei Kong<sup><\/sup>, Peter Kaiser<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bee57cf7-4eda-4ccf-8fa3-8e47df1b84cb","ControlNumber":"5189","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Despite the success of ICB in these contexts, such strategies are not universally effective due to unresponsiveness or development of resistance by the malignant cells. Poor understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to ICB resistance is a crucial barrier to more effective ICB. Recent studies have demonstrated that the metabolic milieu of the tumor microenvironment (TME) can modulate the anti-tumor immune response. However, the specific mechanisms by which the secretion of cancer cell metabolites into the TME impacts the efficacy of ICB in unresponsive tumors remains poorly understood. To better characterize the factors that influence ICB, we utilized a murine model (<i>Smad4<sup>-\/-<\/sup>\/Pten<sup>-\/-<\/sup>\/Trp53<sup>-\/-<\/sup>)<\/i> of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) that is responsive to &#945;PD-1. Serial culture and passage of residual tumor cells following exposure to &#945;PD-1 treatment into new recipient mice allowed us to develop an ICB-insensitive CRPC cell line. Unbiased metabolic analysis revealed that the &#945;PD-1 resistant cells produced elevated levels of itaconate, a metabolite whose biological functions in epithelial cells remain poorly characterized. Consistent with this finding, the resistant cells display increased expression of aconitate decarboxylase 1 (<i>Acod1<\/i>), the enzyme responsible for itaconate production. Additionally, we have identified established human epithelial cancer cell lines which express high levels of <i>ACOD1<\/i>. Interestingly, conditioned media (CM) from the <i>Acod1<\/i>-high cell lines, but not the <i>Acod1<\/i>-low lines, restricts the proliferation and activation of na&#239;ve CD8+ T cells <i>in vitro<\/i>. CRISPR-mediated <i>Acod1<\/i> reduction in the &#945;PD-1 insensitive cells (Acod1KO) produces CM which promotes increased na&#239;ve CD8+ T proliferation and activation, suggesting a link between Acod1 abundance in cancer cells and the activity of cytotoxic T cells. Furthermore, Acod1KO tumors have increased CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and increased sensitivity towards &#945;PD-1 ICB <i>in vivo<\/i>. Taken together, these data suggest that cancer cell intrinsic ACOD1 abundance may be predictive of ICB efficacy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolomics,Immune checkpoint blockade,PD-1,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>James  H.

More than 70% of supratentorial (ST) ependymomas harbor fusions of the zinc-finger containing, chromatin modifier ZFTA and the transcriptional activator of NF-&#954;B signaling, RELA. Oncogene-driven metabolic reprogramming is a fundamental hallmark of cancer that enables sustained tumor proliferation. ZFTA-RELA fusion protein is essential for tumorigenesis and our goal is to determine how it drives metabolism in ST-ependymomas. To address this, we developed an <i>in vitro<\/i> isogenic system by expressing the ZFTA-RELA fusion protein in immortalized mouse<i> <\/i>neural stem cells (ZFTA-RELA<sup>FUS<\/sup>). Using this system, we show that these tumor cells selectively upregulate expression of the glutamine transporter (SLC1A5), glutaminase (GLS), and many downstream enzymes in the glutamine metabolic pathway. Therefore, we hypothesized that the ZFTA-RELA fusion drives glutamine metabolism in ST-ependymomas. We further demonstrate that ZFTA-RELA<sup>FUS<\/sup> tumor cells utilize glutamine to maintain redox homeostasis and show marked cell death upon its withdrawal. Moreover, JHU-083, a specific pharmacologic inhibitor of glutaminase, killed ZFTA-RELA<sup>FUS<\/sup> tumor cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. To summarize, our results suggest that the ZFTA-RELA fusion expressing tumor cells exhibit strong glutamine dependence, and targeting it has significant therapeutic relevance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Brain tumors,Glutamine metabolism,Pediatric cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Siva Kumar Natarajan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, James Haggerty-Skeans<sup>2<\/sup>, Joanna Lum<sup>2<\/sup>, Pranav Narayanan<sup>2<\/sup>, Stefan Sweha<sup>2<\/sup>, Sushanth Sunil<sup>2<\/sup>, Pooja Panwalkar<sup>2<\/sup>, Jill Bayliss<sup>2<\/sup>, Peter Sajjakulnukit<sup>2<\/sup>, Derek Dang<sup>1<\/sup>, Abhinav Achreja<sup>3<\/sup>, Deepak Nagrath<sup>3<\/sup>, Costas Lyssiotis<sup>2<\/sup>, Sriram Venneti<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI,<sup>3<\/sup>Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"dfb19ddd-dd7e-4e97-aebf-9b8774377b51","ControlNumber":"4628","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Breast cancers that metastasize to the brain must adapt to lack of lipid availability in the brain environment and are highly dependent on fatty acid synthesis for growth and survival. However, the signaling pathways that regulate precursors of fatty acid synthesis and lipid metabolism in breast cancer brain metastatic (BCBM) tumors are not known. Here, we show that BCBM cells can generate acetyl-CoA, a major metabolite feeding lipid biosynthesis, via phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) by the cyclin-dependent kinse-5 (CDK5) regulated by the nutrient sensor O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). Breast cancer cells selected to metastasize to the brain contain higher levels of O-GlcNAcylation, OGT. and ACSS2-Ser267 phosphorylation compared to parental cells, and we show that human breast cancer brain metastatic patient samples contain elevated ACSS2-Ser-267 levels. Additionally, overexpression of the OGT, CDK5, or ACSS2-S267D phospho-mimetic mutant confers a growth advantage of breast cancer cells in the brain <i>in vivo. <\/i>Importantly, we show that ACSS2 is required for breast cancer growth in the brain but not in the mammary fat pad.<i> <\/i>Pharmacologically targeting the CDK5 or ACSS2 with respective small molecule inhibitors reduces tumor growth in orthotopic <i>ex vivo<\/i> brain slice model.

Some metabolites, including a non-essential amino acid, serine, have been shown to play a role in tumorigenesis by promoting aggressive cell states, such as cancer stem cells (CSCs). Previous studies from our laboratory showed that the nuclear branch of the Wnt\/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway, the &#946;-catenin\/CBP\/MLL1 axis, enhanced CSC states during oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) evolution through H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and epigenetic remodeling of the chromatin landscape. Given that metabolism has also been shown to modulate cell plasticity via epigenomic modifications, we have aimed to decode the relationship between serine synthesis and cell identity in OSCC.<br \/>We have shown that under serine starvation conditions, OSCC cells upregulate steady-state mRNA and protein levels of serine synthesis pathway enzymes. The latter is associated with an increase in the by-product, alpha-ketoglutarate (&#945;KG), a co-substrate for nuclear &#945;KG-dependent dioxygenases, which demethylate histone marker H3K27me3 and de-repress differentiation-associated genes. Furthermore, increased production of &#945;KG is associated with downregulation of the &#946;-catenin\/CBP\/MLl1 complex and CSC-associated H3K4me3.<br \/>In this study, we used human OSCC cell lines CAL27 and HSC3, derived from a primary tongue tumor and a metastatic site, respectively. Each cell line was cultured in either complete medium or serine starvation medium. Serine starvation conditions led to a downregulation of H3K27me3 along with H3K4me3, promoting a switch from cancer stem cell to differentiation-enhancing chromatin landscape. The observed changes in cell plasticity were further investigated through tumorsphere formation, a surrogate assay for cancer stem cells. We found that OSCC CAL27 and HSC3 cells readily formed tumorspheres replete with stem cell markers BMI1, KRT14 and SOX2, under non-adhesive conditions when grown in complete media, supporting our findings that utilization of exogenous serine enables OSCC cells to maintain stemness. Our findings suggest that a switch from exogenous serine uptake to the endogenous serine biosynthesis promotes OSCC cell differentiation concomitant with the loss of CSC identity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolism,Cancer metabolism,Cancer stem cells,Oral cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Stacy Ann Jankowski<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Nina  C.

Cancer cells are adept at quickly switching between metabolic pathways to adapt to nutrient limitations in the environment, enhancing their growth advantages while negatively impacting other cells in the tumor microenvironment such as immune cells. To facilitate metabolic characterization of cancer cells, we developed assays for detection of metabolites involved in key pathways, such as glycolysis and glutaminolysis, using a bioluminescent NADH detection technology coupled to specific dehydrogenases. We have now extended these assays to include metabolites involved in glycogen, lipid, ketone body and amino acid metabolism, as well as intermediates in the TCA cycle such as malate, isocitrate, and 2-hydroxyglutarate.&nbsp;A second core bioluminescent hydrogen peroxide detection system was also used to develop an assay for pyruvate.&nbsp;Here we describe the use of these assays to measure metabolite levels in cell lysates and cell culture media collected from cancer cell lines plated in 96- or 384-well plates and in 2D or 3D cultures. Changes in metabolite levels were monitored in response to altered media composition and drug treatments. Levels were also compared between different cell lines.&nbsp;In comparative studies of glioblastoma cell lines, 2-hydroxyglutarate production was higher in cells expressing mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase. By reconfiguring the NADH detection technology to measure cellular enzyme activity rather than metabolite levels, we were able to detect activity of dehydrogenases that participate in the glycolysis pathway, the TCA cycle, and pentose phosphate pathway.&nbsp;Assays for cellular malate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and other dehydrogenase enzymes were sensitive, requiring &#8804; 400 lysed cells per assay.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) exhibits the worst outcome due to an aggressive clinical course, high rates of metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Lack of effective FDA approved anti-metastatic targeted therapies has generated an unmet medical need for developing effective novel treatments. Targeting metastatic seeding and colonization remains a therapeutic challenge. Only recently, attention has been drawn to the idea that cancer cells selectively and dynamically adapt their metabolism along the changing microenvironments of the metastatic cascade. However, the precise nature of the metabolic reprograming <i>in vivo<\/i> is poorly understood and constitutes a major barrier in formulating a rationally designed therapeutic approach. Using a genetic lineage tracing approach, we identified a discrete subpopulation of highly metastatic SOX2\/OCT4+ cells within primary tumors that exhibit enhanced invasion and metastasis, increased self-renewal, higher chromosomal instability, and marked resistance to chemotherapy. We posited that this lineage tracing system may allow assessment of precise metabolic alterations as a function of tumor progression directly <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Methods and data. Transcriptomic analysis of sorted cellular fractions from progressing primary TNBC tumor identified metabolic heterogeneities between metastatic SOX2\/OCT4+ and the SOX2\/OCT4- counterparts. SOX2\/OCT4+ metastatic cells exhibited elevated levels of mitochondrial respiration (OXPHOS) and fatty acid (FA) metabolism; a finding supported by proteomic analysis. Using a combination of CRISPR knockout of key pathway genes, seahorse metabolic flux analysis, metabolomics, and stable isotope tracing, we provide evidence for increased dependence of the metastatic SOX2\/OCT4+ population on these unique metabolic adaptions. Importantly, we have identified upstream regulators of these pathways and demonstrate impact of both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the metabolic regulatory networks on metastasis <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Conclusion. By identifying metabolic adaptations unique to the metastatic compartment of the primary tumor, we provide evidence for using clinical grade pharmacological inhibitors including metformin, tetrathiomolybdate and FA pathway inhibitors like TVB-2640 and BMS-303141, as an anti-metastatic approach in TNBC. This knowledge of metabolic remodeling could therefore be employed as a next-generation therapeutic approach for high-risk TNBC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Fatty acids,Metastasis,Metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Divya Ramchandani<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Liron Yoffe<sup>1<\/sup>, Arshdeep Singh<sup>1<\/sup>, Linda Vahdat<sup>2<\/sup>, Vivek Mittal<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY,<sup>2<\/sup>Dartmouth Cancer Center, Lebanon, NH","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"07d60913-7fbf-431f-98c4-cee18d1cf9b5","ControlNumber":"6909","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

Therefore, in the present study we explored the metabolic alterations induced by the pharmacological inhibition of CK2&#945; in B and T ALL. We studied the effect of CK2&#945; inhibition using a specific inhibitor - CX4945 on cell proliferation, glucose utilization, lactate production, and intracellular ATP levels using established methods in human B-ALL (NALM6) cell line. Effect of CX4945 on glycolysis was studied using the Seahorse cell analyzer in human B (NALM6 and 697) and T (MOLT4 and 697) ALL cell lines. Metabolomics study was undertaken to analyze differential metabolite profiling in NALM6 cells treated with CX4945 compared to vehicle using LC-MS\/MS based methods. Results showed that CX4945 induced apoptotic cell death in ALL cell lines with IC50 concentrations ranging between 4-10 &#181;M. CX4945 treatment significantly affected the glucose consumption in NALM6 cells. Similarly, substantial decrease in intracellular ATP and lactate levels compared to vehicle was recorded. CK2&#945; inhibition significantly decreased the glycolytic activity in B- and T-ALL cell lines. It was observed that glycolytic reserves were significantly decreased in 697 (3-fold), MOLT4 (4-fold), CEM (3-fold) cells incubated with CX4945 in comparison to vehicle. The principal component analysis from metabolomics study showed a clear separation between CX4945 and vehicle-treated NAML6 cells. Sixty-four statistically significant, differentially expressed metabolites were recorded in the study. Analyte classes included TCA cycle intermediates, nucleic acids and their precursors as well as glycolysis intermediates that were significantly affected by CK2&#945; inhibition. In conclusion, our study shows that selective inhibition of CK2&#945; by CX4945 caused energy deficiency and cell death in ALL cell lines. CK2 inhibition targeted the key energy dependent pathway by rendering ALL cells inefficient in utilizing glucose and operating glycolysis for generation of cellular energy. These results offer a new mechanistic understanding of CK2&#945; inhibition mediated ablation of ALL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinases,IKAROS,Glucose metabolism,Leukemias: acute lymphoblastic,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Diwakar Bastihalli Tukaramrao<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Arati Sharma<sup>2<\/sup>, Dhimant Desai<sup>2<\/sup>, Sinisa Dovat<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Pediatrics, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Pharmacology, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d23a47f6-276d-4841-b758-dcf6e0c0b07e","ControlNumber":"7854","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

Sulfation is accomplished by the universal sulfate donor, PAPS (3'-Phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate), which is synthesized by bifunctional enzymes PAPSS1 and PAPSS2 (PAPS synthases). The PAPSS2 gene situates near PTEN and is frequently deleted with PTEN across cancer types. Approximately 20% of prostate cancer patients exhibit loss of PTEN, and ~50% of these cases also sustain a loss of PAPSS2. However, the loss of PAPSS2 appears to be tolerated and possibly compensated by its functionally redundant paralogue, PAPSS1, located on chromosome 4q24. The functional redundancy between PAPSS1 and PAPSS2 suggests that these two genes may be collateral lethality pair provided that sulfation is essential for cancer cell viability. Thus, we hypothesize that targeting PAPSS1 in PTEN\/PAPSS2-null prostate cancer can generate cancer-specific vulnerabilities while leaving normal cells undisturbed. To assess this possibility, knockdown and knockout of PAPSS1 in cell lines of PAPSS2-null and PAPSS2-wildtype background were generated to characterize cell viability&nbsp;<i>in vitro<\/i>&nbsp;and tumor formation&nbsp;<i>in vivo<\/i>. PAPS and APS, an intermediary product of the sulfation pathway, are measured to verify that no alternative pathways for sulfate donors exist and that the co-extinction of PAPSS1\/2 eliminates all avenues of generating sulfate donors. Combined extinction of PAPSS1\/2 across multiple cancer cell lines was shown to be tolerated&nbsp;<i>in vitro<\/i>, and recurrent changes in morphology were observed. Loss of sulfation verified by the disappearance of sulfotyrosine and mass spectrometry measurements of PAPS and APS are pending. Our&nbsp;<i>In vitro results&nbsp;<\/i>surprisingly indicate that a major PTM, like sulfation is entirely dispensable for cancer cell viability under normal culture conditions. However, PAPSS1\/2-null cell lines demonstrated a profound delay in tumor formation and prolonged survival, suggesting that sulfation may be required for stromal and innate immune modulation.&nbsp;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PTEN,Prostate cancer,Metabolism,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ko-Chien Chen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yonhong Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Chenchu Lin<sup>1<\/sup>, Er-Yen (Nick) Yen<sup>1<\/sup>, Francesca Citron<sup>1<\/sup>, Xingdi Ma<sup>1<\/sup>, Tan Lin<sup>1<\/sup>, Philip Lorenzi<sup>2<\/sup>, Florian Muller<sup>3<\/sup>, Ronald DePinho<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>3<\/sup>Sporos Bioventures, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ecd84feb-8964-46ac-8e9d-e3dfb9baf3f3","ControlNumber":"4083","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

Developing multi-dimensional <i>in vitro<\/i> platforms can help explore different tumor micro-environments and can thus offer therapeutic opportunities. For a molecular-level understanding, non-destructive and label-free imaging techniques combined with <i>in vitro<\/i> tumor models offer discovery and automation potential for targeted studies. Here, we use the Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic imaging technique to profile biomolecular behavior of U87-MG GBM cell lines in a 2D culture in varied metabolic and tumor micro-environment conditions. As a micro-environmental cue, we chose to vary different molecular weights of hyaluronic acid (HA), a key component of brain&#8217;s extra-cellular matrix (ECM) and known to significantly influence cell-behavior. U87-MG cell lines were cultured for 72 hours in a DMEM supplemented with combinations of (i) glucose concentration: absent (0 mM), normal (5.5 mM) and elevated (25 mM) and (ii) molecular weights of 2 &#956;g\/ml HA: low (10 kDa)-LMW, medium (60 kDa)-MMW and high (500 kDa)-HMW. Fixed cells at different timepoints were imaged with FTIR and stained for HA-specific CD44 and RHAMM markers. Supernatant media was analyzed for metabolite expressions with LC\/MS. FTIR study revealed that the Phosphate I\/Amide II and Amide I\/Amide II IR absorbance ratios were significantly influenced in the presence of 500 kDa HA. Visible differences in the phosphate (~1080 cm<sup>-1<\/sup>) and lipid (~2936 cm<sup>-1<\/sup>) intensities indicated signs of DNA breakages and changes in oxidative stress levels. Areas under the peaks representing &#945;-helix (decrease) and &#946;-sheet (increase) proteins revealed signs of protein denaturation in HMW HA cultures. These cultures also revealed elevated RHAMM expressions while the CD44 expression remained relatively unchanged. Metabolic profiling with LC\/MS revealed an increase in metabolites like choline, histidine, and creatine, for cells cultured in the 0 mM glucose and HMW HA. Ornithine and Methionine remained relatively unaffected by the HA weight but showed some dependence on changing glucose levels. Proline and Tyrosine majorly showed HA weight-specific variations. Overall, this preliminary study has shown the impact of glucose and HA weight-specific effects on the biomolecular content and metabolic profiles of cancer cells. Most of the altered metabolite expressions seen are known to be involved in the Arginine-biosynthesis pathway which suggests a possible alteration in the same in response to environmental glucose and weight-specific HA levels. Further studies would involve the use of multi-dimensional hydrogel-cell models to assess variations in a more bio-mimetic surrounding. Highlighting altered metabolic pathways could help present novel therapeutic targets for future.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-01 Metabolic pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer markers,Glioblastoma,Imaging,Cancer metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ashwin  A.

Metastatic cancer remains incurable as a population of cancer cells within a tumor are resistant to all known therapies. Despite decades of research, the source of therapeutic resistance is still unknown. We have identified the polyaneuploid cancer cell (PACC) state as a chemo-resistant cell state that is associated with therapeutic resistance. Cells in the PACC state are large in size, have high genomic content, and represent the majority cell state following high dose chemotherapy <i>in vitro<\/i>. While the PACC state has been documented in patient samples of many cancer types, including prostate cancer where it is associated with progression, the survival mechanisms that enable the PACC state remain largely undefined. We discovered that cells in the PACC state are highly metabolically active and contain a higher number of lipid droplets (LDs) than the non-polyploid parental cells they are derived from. LDs act as central anti-lipotoxic organelles and sequestration of toxic moieties into LDs allows for lower lipotoxicity in cells and higher chances of survival and future proliferation. Higher levels of LDs are associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and chemotherapy resistance. We found that PLIN1 (an exclusive LD surface protein), and DGAT1 (an enzyme that catalyzes the generation of TAG, which is the main component of LDs) are expressed at higher levels in the tumors of prostate cancer patients with lower disease-free survival and higher Gleason score. This indicates that aggressive prostate cancer is most likely associated with high levels of LDs. We hypothesize that cells entering the PACC state survive chemotherapeutic stress by having an elevated metabolism and sequestering toxic lipids into LDs to enhance cell survival. Metabolomic and lipidomic data demonstrate that PACCs have a highly active TCA cycle and higher overall lipids in multiple classes compared to the parental cells they are derived from. Additionally, utilizing flow cytometry and imaging, we found that LDs form in cells accessing the PACC state as early as three hours post chemotherapy treatment, suggesting a crucial role for avoiding lipotoxicity. We also observed low levels of HSL (a rate limiting enzyme in lipolysis) in the PACC state indicating that after PACCs form LDs they do not immediately break them down, another possible mechanism of avoiding lipotoxicity. We have shown this in four cancer cell lines from two tumor types (Prostate cancer: PC3, DU145, and LNCaP. Breast cancer: MDA-MB-231) with three classes of chemotherapies (cisplatin, docetaxel, etoposide), proving the observed phenotype is not specific to any one cell line, tumor type, or drug class. Our future work will focus on inhibiting lipid droplet formation <i>in vivo<\/i> and <i>in vitro<\/i> to increase cellular lipotoxicity in the PACC state to induce cancer cell death.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB09-02 Metabolomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lipids,Prostate cancer,Metabolomics,Cancer metabolism,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Laurie Gayle Kostecka<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Anne Le<sup><\/sup>, Sarah Amend<sup><\/sup>, Kenneth  J.
