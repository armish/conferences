High density of TAMs is well-recognized as a feature of tumor progression and poor prognostic factor across various tumor types. Therefore, therapeutic strategies to dampen TAMs&#8217; suppressive potential in TME and reprogram them towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype are being increasingly appreciated as being paramount for an effective immunotherapy. Nevertheless, the key mediators of TAM-induced immunosuppression remain largely unknown, identification of which can lead to the development of novel immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at re-educating the immunosuppressive TAMs to an anti-tumor phenotype. To systematically interrogate the genes responsible for the immune-suppressive phenotype of TAMs, we developed a functional, high-throughput genetic screening platform (iOTarg&#8482;) based on human primary monocyte-derived M2-like macrophages. Using CRISPR, we knocked out a proprietary library of well-expressed and druggable genes (1400 genes) in two independent donor-derived M2-like macrophages and cocultured them with activated autologous effector T cells (TCs). We achieved nearly complete knockout (KO) efficacy over a range of control genes. Functional impact of individual KO on macrophage viability and phenotype, as well as on TC activity, was measured using multiparametric assay readouts. Initial hits were reconfirmed in three additional donors in a secondary screen that integrated an additional tumor lysis readout. As expected, knockout of CSF1R, which is essential for macrophage maintenance, resulted in a dramatic loss of macrophage cell viability, whereas KO of established TAM markers, TREM2 and Clever-1, induced a change in macrophage phenotype. Furthermore, KO of immune-inhibitory receptor LILRB2 reduced the M2-like phenotype and restored TC activity. Inhibition of M2 activation of macrophages and subsequent increase in TC activation culminated in strong tumor cell killing for a subset of genes, highlighting an untapped repertoire of novel TAM-associated immune-checkpoint targets. Taken together, we report for the first time a highly sophisticated target discovery platform that addresses the functional role of any TAM-expressed gene in regulating macrophage viability, phenotype, T cell activity and even its gross impact on tumor cell lysis, all done in a high-throughput format employing CRISPR-edited primary human immune cells and multi-parametric functional immunological assays. As a result, we could confirm well-known targets in clinical testing, as well as identify additional novel targets that could lead to first-in-class, TME-based therapeutics and expansion of treatment options in immune oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-10 Modifiers of the tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Tumor associated macrophages,Screening,CRISPR\/Cas9,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Kritika Sudan<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Tillmann Michels<\/b><sup>2<\/sup>, Carmen Amerhauser<sup>1<\/sup>, Claudia Tschulik<sup>1<\/sup>, Leonie Majunke<sup>1<\/sup>, Lucille Albert<sup>2<\/sup>, Valentina Volpin<sup>1<\/sup>, Adriana Turqueti-Neves<sup>1<\/sup>, Ronny Milde<sup>1<\/sup>, Nisit Khandelwal<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Research Department, iOmx Therapeutics AG, Martinsried\/Munich, Germany,<sup>2<\/sup>iOmx Therapeutics AG, Martinsried\/Munich, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"273cf499-f97f-4a9a-8285-7eec46517a45","ControlNumber":"4256","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;K.

Even at early stages, death rates remain disproportionately high due to metastatic recurrence. Recently, blockade of the PD-1\/PD-L1 axis has shown impressive increases in recurrence-free survival in a subset of patients. While efforts to decrease relapse have focused on decreasing residual micrometastatic disease at the time of definitive treatment, PD-1 directed therapy may allow for an adaptive immune response and the establishment of anti-tumor immunosurveillance. Building on results from a clinically relevant murine model of metastatic relapse after tumor resection and robust assays on systematically characterized tumor, lymph node and blood samples of early-stage lung cancer patients, we posit that immunologic CD8 T cell memory may be a primary mechanism of metastatic protection.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We utilized a syngeneic murine model of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma (344SQ) after resection of tumor, tumor draining lymph node (tdLN) and non-draining lymph nodes (ndLN). Using bioluminescent imaging (BLI) and flow cytometric analysis we monitored T cell kinetics and anti-tumor activity after administration of anti-PD-1 antibody and\/or KD033, a fusion antibody combining a high affinity anti-PD-L1 IgG1 antibody with an IL-15R&#945; sushi binding domain. Tumor\/tdLN and ndLN T cells were characterized for PD-1\/TCF-1\/CD62L\/CD44\/CXCR5 memory phenotypes. In parallel, we analyzed resected tumor, tdLN and ndLN from early-stage NSCLC patients.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> tdLN from murine models and early-stage patients maintain robust PD-1+ CXCR5+ CD8 T cell memory phenotypes not significantly found in the primary tumor, ndLN and peripheral blood. Neoadjuvant treatment with PD-1 blockade alone had a heterogenous response, with robust proliferation of T cell central and stem cell memory populations (CM &#38; SCM) at the tdLN in responders compared to non-responders (p&#60;0.05). Combination therapy with IL-15R&#945; agonist (KD033) potentiated diverse PD-1+ CXCR5+ CD8 stem cell like memory subsets in the tdLN and subsequent response at the primary tumor (100%) as well as displayed superior protection against metastatic recurrence up to 200 days compared to PD-1 inhibition or KD033 alone (median survival undetermined vs. 120d, 161d respectively p&#60;0.05). Removal of tdLN or blockade of lymph node migration with FTY720 prior to therapy decreased a population of SCM and CM CD8 T cells found in the primary tumor, decreased primary tumor response and altered systemic memory subpopulations in the ndLN (p&#60;0.05).<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Our data strongly points to a T cell memory response within the tumor draining lymph node as a possible driver of protection from systemic cancer recurrence, laying the groundwork for a new therapeutic strategy aimed at establishing CD8 immunosurveillance for protection from cancer recurrence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Combination therapy,Lymph nodes,T lymphocytes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tatiana Delgado Cruz<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Geoffrey  J.

However, for many types of cancer, targeting either PD-1 or PD-L1 is associated with clinical benefit in a minority of patients. Combination strategies are needed to improve clinical benefit rates in &#8216;immune responsive&#8217; cancers, and to expand treatment options for non-responsive cancers. Preclinical models have revealed that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) possess T cell-suppressive activities associated with resistance to PD-1\/PD-L1 targeted therapies. To reveal therapeutic targets to relieve this suppression, we developed a robust cell-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to identify small molecules that can relieve myelomonocytic cell-dependent T cell-suppression, and that enhance T cell activities when combined with PD-1\/PD-L1 ICI.<br \/>Methods: Bone marrow-derived myelomonocytic cells and splenic T cells were used to develop the HTS assay. After exposure to libraries of small molecules, co-cultures were evaluated for enhanced T cell activity, followed by in vivo investigations of emerging small molecules in syngeneic murine models of breast cancer to reveal anti-tumor activity.<br \/>Results: Over 1,400 FDA-approved drugs, used for both cancer or non-cancer indications, were screened in the HTS assay, 66 of which demonstrated activity in the HTS assay. Approximately 50% of these were known anti-inflammatory agents, with the highest density reflecting various COX-2 inhibitors (COX-2i). In vivo, combination therapy of the COX-2i with PD-1\/PD-L1 ICI resulted in a significant reduction in tumor growth kinetics in both 4T1 and EMT6 breast cancer models, both of which are resistant to PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors as monotherapy. In the 4T1 model, slowed tumor kinetics was associated with ICI increased T cell activation as compared to controls or monotherapy anti-PD-1\/PD-L1 therapy.<br \/>Conclusions: A myelomonocytic cell-dependent T cell-suppression assay can be used to develop a HTS platform for discovering combination therapies showing antitumor responses in preclinical models. COX-2 inhibitors can be repurposed to enhance therapeutic benefits of PD-1\/PD-L1 targeting agents in breast cancer patients.<br \/>Keywords: Myelomonocytic cells, T-cell, immunotherapy, PD-1, PD-L1, breast cancer","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells,Immune checkpoint,Immunotherapy,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sushil Kumar<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Dhanir Tailor<sup>1<\/sup>, Arpit Dheeraj<sup>1<\/sup>, Wenqi Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Jee Min Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Kirsten Stefan<sup>1<\/sup>, Dylan Nelson<sup>1<\/sup>, Shivaani Kummar<sup>2<\/sup>, Lisa  M.

CBL-b is widely expressed in immune cells and plays as a &#8220;gate keeper&#8221; to negatively regulate the activation of immune cells. Engagement of TCR\/BCR triggers the Cbl-b-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of the key components in TCR axis, such as Vav1 and PLC&#947;, and consequently attenuates TCR\/BCR signal axis which finally results in T\/B cells exhaustion. Besides, Cbl-b was reported to negatively regulate the activation of dendritic cells, NK, NKT, and mast cells.<i> Cbl-b<\/i> KO mice show resistance to tumor transplantation, and the anti-tumor activities depend on the T and NK cells. According to the above observation, Cbl-b emerges as a novel intracellular immune checkpoint target to prevent immune cells from exhaustion and improve the antitumor immunotherapy. Here we identified a series of highly potent Cbl-b inhibitors. The inhibition of Cbl-b protein was evaluated by an <i>in vitro<\/i> CBL-b\/E2-ubiquitin assay. Results showed that our candidates strongly inhibited Cbl-b with IC50s at single-digital nanomolar level, and meanwhile, these compounds displayed over than 10-fold selectivity against c-CBL\/E2-ubiquitin, a member of the Cbl family, which was reported to synergistically enhance toxicity caused by Cbl-b. Consistent with the Cbl-b inhibition, these compounds further enhanced activation of Jurkat T cells as well as human PBMCs with dramatical increase of IL-2 or IFN&#611; secretion in presence of anti-CD3\/CD28, and without any significant cytotoxicity even up to 10 &#181;M concertation. Furthermore, these compounds exhibited the restoring function in exhausted T cells in presence with PEG2 or adenosine treatment. Favorable ADME and bioavailability supported the oral administration. In na&#239;ve mice, our inhibitors dose-dependently promoted the cytokine IL-2 and IFN&#611; production in serum and spleens following the anti-CD3 challenge. In a syngeneic model, CT26, oral administration of our Cbl-b inhibitor effectively inhibited tumor growth, while completely inhibited tumor growth in combination with an anti-PD1 antibody. Further study demonstrated that the increased lymphocytes infiltration and cytokines release in tumor tissues were observed either in Cbl-b mono or in anti-PD1 combo groups, which correlated well with anti-tumor efficacy. In conclusion, our selective Cbl-b inhibitors demonstrated robust immune activation and anti-tumor activity <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo<\/i> and showed synergistic activities with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD(L)1. Currently, one of our leading molecules is in IND enabling studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,T cell,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Feng Zhou<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhengtao Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Yajing Liu<sup>3<\/sup>, Guimei Yang<sup>3<\/sup>, Wansun Mai<sup>4<\/sup>, Wenqing Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Liting Xue<sup>1<\/sup>, Ping Chen<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Renhong Tang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>State Key Laboratory of Translational Medicine and Innovative Drug Development, Jiangsu Simcere Pharmaceutical Co.

While oncogenic RAS primarily promotes tumor progression through sustained cellular proliferation, there is also increasing evidence that it adversely shapes the tumor microenvironment (TME) through the induction of immuno-suppressive cytokines<sup>2<\/sup>, downregulation of MHCI, and modulation of checkpoint proteins<sup>3<\/sup>.<br \/>KRAS<sup>G12D <\/sup>oncoproteins can be selectively targeted with the covalent tri-complex RAS(ON) inhibitor, RMC-9805, which has been shown to inhibit RAS signaling in KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> mutant cancer cells and induce apoptosis. RMC-9805 also decreased the secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines by KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> tumor cells, while promoting the secretion of lymphocyte-recruiting factors.<br \/>Oral administration of RMC-9805 drove durable complete responses and synergized with anti-PD-1 in an immune-infiltrated colorectal KRAS<sup>G12D <\/sup>mutant model. Re-challenge experiments further demonstrated that RMC-9805 induced immunological memory. The activity of RMC-9805 was also assessed in an orthotopic, immune-evasive, GEMM-derived preclinical model for PDAC, where it induced a profound and sustained inhibition of RAS signaling, driving initial tumor regressions and significantly prolonging survival.<br \/>Tumors treated with RMC-9805 <i>in vivo <\/i>showed significant transformation of the TME in favor of anti-tumor immunity, with an increase in T cell infiltration and decrease in immunosuppressive myeloid cells, including M2-like macrophages and MDSCs. RMC-9805 also modulated expression of cancer cell surface proteins, notably decreasing expression of immune checkpoint molecules while significantly increasing MHC-I expression. TCR sequencing of T cells from tumors and blood harvested from treated mice revealed a significant increase in T cell diversity, as well as an increase in the number of shared TCR clones among all KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup>(ON) inhibitor-treated samples, suggesting cancer-associated antigen recognition.<br \/>Overall, in these preclinical experiments, RMC-9805 exhibited direct anti-tumor effects and indirectly transformed the TME through inhibition of cancer cell-intrinsic KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup> oncogenic signaling. The increased antigen presentation, recognition, and T cell infiltration induced by inhibition of mutant KRAS may permit a more favorable environment for immune-directed &#8216;companion&#8217; therapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, cellular therapies, and\/or vaccines.<br \/>[1] Timar, J. et al, 2020 [2] Hamarsheh, S. et al, 2020 [3] Sumimoto, H. et al, 2016","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-04 Immune mechanisms invoked by other therapies including chemotherapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Targeted therapy,Neoantigens,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Marie  J.

Here we examined whether TAK-243, a small molecule inhibitor of the ubiquitin activating enzyme (UAE), could heighten tumor immunogenicity and increase response to checkpoint inhibition. Our hypothesis was based on previous studies showing that TAK-243 induces ER stress (Hyer et al.) a phenomenon that can influence the status of the immune TME. While TAK-243 has previously shown anti-tumor potential, these studies were largely performed in immune-deficient models of cancer leaving potential influence on immune response in question. We first examined this potential using multiplexed trackable intratumor microdosing (CIVO<sup>TM<\/sup>, Presage Biosciences) to introduce TAK-243 alone or in combination with an anti-PD1 antibody (RPM1-14) to distinct localized positions within in a syngeneic model of lymphoma (A20). Response to localized drug exposure was then evaluated by immunohistochemistry and <i>in situ<\/i> hybridization biomarker analysis. TAK-243 induced elevation of multiple immune response biomarkers including 1) dendritic cell enrichment, 2) chemokine elevation, 3) TNFa elevation, and 4) CD8\/Granzyme B elevation. We next examined whether TAK-243 could act as an &#8220;<i>in situ<\/i> vaccine&#8221; upon intratumor delivery and increase response to systemically delivered anti-PD1. Consistent with this potential, intratumor injection of TAK-243 resulted in greater regression of tumors in a dual flanked A20 xenograft model (ie one tumor on each flank of the host) when combined with systemically delivered anti-PD1 compared to either TAK-243 or anti-PD1 treatment alone. Importantly clear abscopal effects were induced as tumor regression was observed in both TAK-243 injected and non-injected tumors from subjects treated with the combination of TAK-243 and anti-PD1, 60% of which showed complete loss of tumor. Inhibition of the anti-tumor response was observed upon introduction of the drug combination with a CD8-depleting antibody. Furthermore, re-inoculation of subjects that exhibited complete regression of tumor masses with A20 cells showed no growth of new tumors. Taken together, these data suggest that intratumor injection of TAK-243 has potential to act as an <i>in situ<\/i> vaccine which increases anti-tumor immunogenicity and primes tumors for response to ICIs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Combination therapy,Immunomodulation,Tumor microenvironment,Ubiquitination,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Richard Klinghoffer<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Connor Burns<sup><\/sup>, Angela Merrell<sup><\/sup>, Marc Grenley<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Presage Biosciences, Seattle, WA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"50394ef7-3778-4cd9-8621-5bb1d5ee4c4b","ControlNumber":"7592","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;R.

Three inhibitory receptors, TIGIT, CD96, and PVRIG, inhibit the activating receptor CD226 by competing for shared ligands (CD112 and CD155) expressed on tumor cells and myeloid cells. Blocking the TIGIT receptor with monoclonal antibodies is a major focus of current clinical development efforts. However, the effectiveness of targeting TIGIT alone in a clinical setting has yet to be demonstrated. We hypothesize that blocking TIGIT alone may not lead to an optimal clinical outcome since immuno-stimulatory interaction between the ligands CD112 and CD155 with CD226 can be competed by inhibitory receptors CD96 and PVRIG in addition to TIGIT. It is therefore interesting to investigate whether all these checkpoints play critical roles in the tumor environment and if inhibiting one or more may be necessary to achieve the maximum CD226 activation in both innate and adaptive immune cells. To address that, we have conducted single-cell analysis and demonstrated high expression levels and co-expression of the three inhibitory receptors on T cell subsets and NK cells in the tumor microenvironment for multiple tumor types. Thus, simultaneous blockade of two or more of these receptors might be required for full CD226 activation and T and NK cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. We envision developing blocking antibodies to these receptors in the CD226 axis toward potential combinations or multi-specific antibody therapies against solid tumors. Antibodies against all three checkpoints, i.e., TIGIT, CD96, and PVRIG, were selected based on receptor binding and their ability to block the receptor interaction with their ligands. We have demonstrated the functionality of the antibodies against these three targets and explored the best approach to alleviate the suppressive regulation of CD226 signaling. Detailed characterizations of these antibodies have been performed, and multi-specific antibodies have been generated and evaluated. Through this effort, we aim to define and develop the best therapeutic strategy for unleashing the CD226 axis for T and NK cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,TIGIT,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Tom Li Stephen<sup><\/sup>, Qian Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Byung-Kwon Lee<sup><\/sup>, Chao Kong<sup><\/sup>, Rain Sun<sup><\/sup>, Jia Wu<sup><\/sup>, Jie Cui<sup><\/sup>, Hillary Shah<sup><\/sup>, Wenhua Xu<sup><\/sup>, Yun-Yueh Lu<sup><\/sup>, Joshua Whitener<sup><\/sup>, Emily Jackson<sup><\/sup>, <b>Jinping Gan<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Francisco Adrian<sup><\/sup>, Liang Schweizer<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Disease Biology, HiFiBiO Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3554c285-7b23-49dc-85bd-d3dc38d3f2a2","ControlNumber":"7622","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;T.
