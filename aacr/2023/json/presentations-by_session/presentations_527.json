Over the last decade, covalent and reversible inhibitors of BTK have proven effective for the treatment of many of these including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. However, the long-term efficacy of BTK inhibitors has been limited by both tolerability and the emergence of acquired resistance mutations. Mutations at C481, for example, dramatically reduce the binding of covalent BTK inhibitors, whereas other clinically-observed mutations such as V416L, T474I, and L528W reduce or eliminate the activity of next-generation non-covalent inhibitors. Targeted protein degradation is emerging as a new modality of small molecule drug discovery that offers improved selectivity and the potential to overcome resistance mutations through its ability to efficiently remove therapeutically relevant proteins such as BTK from cells. This approach has the further benefit of eliminating the scaffolding function of proteins that are otherwise unaffected by enzymatic inhibitors. Here, we present the discovery, structure-activity relationships, and pre-clinical characterization of NX-2127, a targeted protein degrader of BTK with concomitant immunomodulatory activity (IKZF1\/3 degradation). NX-2127 degrades BTK in multiple B cell lymphoma lines with DC50&#8217;s in the range of 1-13 nM. NX-2127 displays efficient cellular degradation yet binds to WT and mutant BTK with affinities that render covalent and noncovalent BTK inhibitors ineffective, illustrating the power of event-driven pharmacology. NX-2127 drives cellular ternary complex formation between BTK and CRBN by inducing positive cooperativity in both WT and acquired resistance mutant settings. Consequently, NX-2127 induces potent degradation of C481S, T474I, V416L, and L528W-mutant BTK and suppresses activation marker expression on cells harboring these mutations. Furthermore, NX-2127 demonstrates oral bioavailability across pre-clinical species and shows robust tumor growth inhibition in WT and mutant mouse models of lymphoma upon once daily PO dosing. In pre-clinical safety studies, NX-2127 demonstrates an acceptable safety profile. NX-2127 is currently in phase 1 clinical trials (NCT04830137) for hematological malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BTK,Drug design,Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jeffrey  T.

These small molecules act by recruiting ubiquitin ligases to disease-relevant proteins, resulting in neosubstrate ubiquitination and degradation. To date, only a small number of ubiquitin ligase - neosubstrate interactions have been exploited by molecular glue degraders, limiting the targeting scope of this therapeutic modality. Covalent chemistry, which confers high binding affinity and the ability of targeting shallow binding sites, can expand the addressable protein interfaces for molecular glue degraders. In this study, we identified a new class of BRD4 covalent molecular glue degraders (GNE-0011, TMX-4137, MMH-252, MMH-272) by derivatizing electrophiles on the solvent-facing side of a non-degradative BRD4 inhibitor, JQ1. These degraders recruit the ubiquitin ligase CUL4<sup>DCAF16<\/sup> to BRD4 via a novel, <i>trans<\/i>-labeling mechanism we term &#8220;template-assisted covalent modification.&#8221; These covalent small molecules have only weak reactivity to DCAF16 in the absence of BRD4. However, BRD4 binding allows its BD2 domain, in complex with DCAF16, to serve as a structural template to boost the covalent modification of these degraders to DCAF16. This leads to efficient BRD4-degrader-DCAF16 ternary complex formation and subsequent BRD4 degradation. We solved the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the DDB1-DCAF16 ligase complex bound to BRD4(BD2) and MMH-272, demonstrating that DCAF16 and BRD4(BD2) have pre-existing structural complementarity which optimally orients the reactive moiety of MMH-272 for DCAF16 covalent modification. We performed systematic mutagenesis screens of both DCAF16 and BRD4(BD2) to characterize the drug-induced interaction, discovering that Cys58 of DCAF16 is modified by covalent warheads and is critical for the activity of these degraders, and that His437 of BRD4(BD2) and its adjacent residues are important for a stable interaction with DCAF16. Analysis of a chemical series revealed that the covalent reactivity of these small molecules is required for degradation, and that the degree of reactivity can tune the potency and specificity of the degraders. Our work highlights a new class of BRD4 molecular glue degraders that are enabled by the template-assisted covalent modification of DCAF16. The templated reactivity is likely to exist in other covalent small molecules that engage complementary protein interfaces, and this <i>trans<\/i>-labeling mechanism can be exploited to develop covalent drugs with more precisely controlled reactivity. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that the decoration of solvent-exposed electrophiles to protein-binding small molecules has great potential to enable discovery and optimization of novel molecular glue degraders.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH03-03 Small molecule, protein, and nucleic acid interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRD4,Molecular glue degrader,DCAF16,Template-assisted covalent modification,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yen-Der Li<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Michelle W.

Degraders of oncogenic EML4-ALK fusions were developed by conjugating ALK inhibitors to cereblon ligands guided by computational models. To study the sub-stoichiometric capacity of the degrader molecules, simultaneous optimization of pharmacology and compound properties using ternary complex modeling and physicochemical considerations yielded multiple catalytic degraders that were more resilient to clinically relevant ATP-binding site mutations than parental kinase inhibitor drugs. Using HiBiT assay to assess the target degradation and NanoBRET for target occupancy, we illustrated the concept of catalytic degradation of EML4-ALK. Our strategy culminated in the design of the orally bioavailable derivative CPD-1224 that avoided hemolysis (a feature of detergent-like PROTACs), degraded the otherwise recalcitrant compounded mutant L1196M\/G1202R in vivo, and commensurately slowed tumor growth, while the third generation ALK inhibitor drug lorlatinib had no effect. These results validate our original therapeutic hypothesis by exemplifying opportunities for catalytic degraders to proactively address binding site resistant mutations in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ALK,targeted protein degradation,PROTAC,kinase site mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yang Gao<sup>1<\/sup>, Baishan Jiang<sup>1<\/sup>, Hellen Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Jianwei Che<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Katherine Donovan<sup>1<\/sup>, John Hatcher<sup>1<\/sup>, Fidel Huerta<sup>1<\/sup>, Nicholas Kwiatkowski<sup>1<\/sup>, Yingpeng Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Peter Liuni<sup>1<\/sup>, Rebecca J.

This class of drugs induce rapid ubiquitination and degradation of two lymphoid transcription factors (IKZF1 and IKZF3) by recruiting them to CRBN-CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase, which result in pleiotropic anti-tumor effects including autonomous tumor cell death and immune activation. However, prolonged IMiD treatment eventually becomes resistant and leads to tumor relapse in MM patients, mostly due to down-regulation of CRBN. All approved IMiDs also exert adverse effects such as teratogenicity, attributed to CRBN-mediated degradation of neo-substrates SALL4, PLZF1 and &#916;Np63\/TAp63. Here we report the development of a novel selective IKZF1\/3 degrader ICP-490, which can robustly inhibit MM and NHL tumor growth, and overcome lenalidomide resistance.<br \/>Results: ICP-490 induces potent, deep, and selective degradation of IKZF1 and IKZF3 with sub-nanomolar IC<sub>50<\/sub>, but no significant degradation of IKZF2, IKZF4, GSPT1, SALL4 and PLZF1. Cell viability assays reveal robust <i>in vitro <\/i>efficacies of ICP-490 against various MM and NHL(DLBCL) cell lines with nanomolar IC<sub>50<\/sub>. It also exhibits potent anti-proliferative activity in lenalidomide-resistant cell lines. In contrast to its tumor killing effect, ICP-490 shows no cytotoxicity against normal human cells, such as HEK293 and PBMC cells. ICP-490 induces IKZF1\/3 degradation in distinct human lymphocyte lineages, leads to immune cell activation with elevated IL-2 and IFN-&#947; production and down-regulation of TNF-&#945; in PBMC. The immune modulation activity of ICP-490 has also been illustrated in a combinatory treatment with daratumumab, where low dose of ICP-490 leads to robust induction of IL-2 and granzyme B, and much improved efficacy of daratumumab in MM cell line NCI-H929. <i>In vivo <\/i>efficacy studies have further confirmed the effectiveness of ICP-490 against MM and DLBCL xenografts, including MM1.S, MM1.R, NCI-H929 multiple myeloma lines, and TMD-8, WSU-DLCL2 DLBCL lines. ICP-490 also eradicates lenalidomide-resistant NCI-H929 xenografts. ICP-490 has overall favorable pharmacokinetic parameters with high oral bioavailability. Nonclinical safety evaluations of ICP-490 exhibit acceptable drug tolerability in SD rats and cynomolgus monkeys.<br \/>Conclusions: ICP-490 is a highly potent, orally bioavailable, next-generation CRBN-targeting IMiD with selective IKZF1\/3 degradation. In various MM and NHL tumor models, it demonstrates superior tumor killing activities than currently approved IMiDs, including overcoming lenalidomide resistance. ICP-490 is now in phase I clinical trial.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunomodulation,molecular glue,IKZF1\/3,protein degradation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Ruixia Liang<sup><\/sup>, Yucheng Pang<sup><\/sup>, Yingrui Han<sup><\/sup>, Haipeng Xu<sup><\/sup>, Zuopeng Wang<sup><\/sup>, Richard Liu<sup><\/sup>, Charles Ying Wang<sup><\/sup>, Jason Bin Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Xiangyang Chen<sup><\/sup>, <b>Davy Xuesong Ouyang<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>InnoCare Pharma Tech co.

Here, we report the discovery of the first series of highly potent and selective dual CDK12\/13 degraders by employing the proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology. The optimal compound 7f effectively degraded CDK12 and CDK13 with DC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 2.2 nM and 2.1 nM, respectively, in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Global proteomic profiling demonstrated the target selectivity of 7f. In vitro, 7f suppressed expression of core DNA damage response (DDR) genes in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Further, 7f markedly inhibited proliferation of multiple TNBC cell lines including MFM223, with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> value of 47 nM. Importantly, 7f displayed a significantly improved anti-proliferative activity compared to the structurally similar inhibitor 4.The 2<sup>nd<\/sup> generation CDK12\/13 degrader 9069 was further developed, which showed more potent degradation on both CDK12 and CDK13. Interestingly, multiple prostate cancer cell lines were sensitive to 9069, such as VCaP, 22RV1 and LAPC4 with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 22.9, 90.3 and 152.1 nM, respectively. In vivo studies showed a potent tumor growth inhibition in both VCaP CRPC xenograft and PC310 PDX prostate cancer models. These results suggest the potential application of a CDK12\/13 degrader for the treatment of TNBC and prostate cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,CDK12,CDK13,PROTAC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yu Chang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jianzhang Yang<sup>2<\/sup>, Jean Ching-Yi Tien<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhen Wang<sup>3<\/sup>, Yang Zhou<sup>2<\/sup>, Pujuan Zhang<sup>3<\/sup>, Weixue Huang<sup>3<\/sup>, Josh Vo<sup>1<\/sup>, Ingrid J.

This class of degraders function by inducing interactions between a target of interest and a ubiquitin-ligase, either by stabilization of weak pre-existing interactions, or by generation of entirely novel interactions. These molecules offer significant opportunity beyond heterobifunctional degraders such as PROTACs, not least in terms of improved molecular properties.<br \/>However, beyond the IMID molecular glues, typified by thalidomide, pomalidomide and lenalidomide, novel molecular glue chemotypes remain scarce.<br \/>To address this need, we have developed biophysics-based molecular glue screening platform, exploiting our internal, high quality fragment library and proximity-based screening platforms to rapidly identify promising new molecular glues for further optimization. A potential advantage of utilizing cell-free biophysical systems is the opportunity to select both the target and the desired ligase, opening up for development of degraders that capitalize upon differential expression of ligases in different tissues.<br \/>As proof of concept, we have applied this platform to find new molecular glues to degrade CK1&#945;. This Ser\/Thr kinase has been found to be over-expressed in metastatic colorectal cancer, and this over-expression correlates with poor overall survival. The kinase has also been implicated as an oncogenic driver in tumors such as B-Cell lymphomas and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, suggesting a potential therapeutic application for novel CK1&#945; molecular glues.<br \/>Utilizing known IMID-derived molecular glues between CK1&#945; and CRBN as benchmark controls, we identified several non-IMID derived chemotypes as tentative stabilizers of the CRBN\/CK1&#945; interaction. Further studies on these novel candidate degrader templates are now underway.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,Molecular Glue,Biophysics,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yujia Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Jessica Bates<sup><\/sup>, Benoit Gourdet<sup><\/sup>, Louise Birch<sup><\/sup>, Philip Addis<sup><\/sup>, <b>Roland Hjerpe<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Allan M.
