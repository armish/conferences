[{"Abstract":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer; however, pathogenesis of TNBC has not yet been fully understood. Here, we identified dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) by analyzing miRNA microarray of TNBC patients. MiR-371b-5p expression was reduced, and ectopic expression of miR-371b-5p significantly inhibited TNBC progression <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. In addition, we found that expression of cold shock domain-containing protein E1 (CSDE1), a direct target gene of miR-371b-5p, was upregulated in TNBC cells, and inhibition of CSDE1 alleviated TNBC cell growth by decreasing RAC1 known as pro-metastatic gene. Mechanistically, CSDE1, phosphorylated C-terminal domain (p-CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), and CDK7 form a complex, and downregulation of CSDE1 results in weak interaction between RNAPII p-CTD and CDK7, which leads to a decrease in RNAPII p-CTD expression to reduce RAC1 transcript levels in CSDE1-deficient TNBC cells. Our data revealed the oncogenic function of miR-371b\/CSDE1 involved in Rac1 transcription regulation, thus providing a basis for the pathological mechanism of TNBC along with potential biomarkers for TNBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Epigenetics,MicroRNA,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yesol Kim<sup><\/sup>, Je Yeong Ko<sup><\/sup>, Soo-Been Lee<sup><\/sup>, Jaehee Jun<sup><\/sup>, Yejin Ahn<sup><\/sup>, Jinui Min<sup><\/sup>, Chaewon Oh<sup><\/sup>, <b>Jong Hoon Park<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"55d1b749-cb6c-42e3-ac1a-149aaf2870a4","ControlNumber":"8124","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Median overall survival is less than a year, with radiation as the only standard treatment. Recently, mutations in DMGs have arisen as potential therapeutic targets, specifically a mutation in one of the histone H3 genes, resulting in methionine substituted for lysine at site 27 (H3K27M). H3K27M induces a marked reduction in global acetylation of histone tails, altering chromatin structure and causing aberrant gene expression. Histone deacetylase inhibitors, HDACis, are epigenetic drugs that show anticancer activity. In our studies, Quisinostat (Quis) is used to preserve histone acetylation. Using two H3K27M-DMG treatment-naive preclinical models (PBT22 and PBT29) we detected a 100-fold differential response to the histone deacetylase inhibitor, Quisinostat. PBT-22 harbors mutations in <i>H3F3A<\/i>, <i>TP53<\/i>, and <i>ASXL2<\/i>, while PBT-29 has mutations in <i>H3F<\/i>3A, <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>PIK3CA<\/i> and <i>FGFR1<\/i>. Following Quis treatment (48 hrs) in both preclinical models, total H3K27ac protein abundance increased 3-fold, suggesting HDACi stabilizes or impedes turnover of K27 acetylated H3 histone. We are pursuing studies to test whether sensitivity to HDACi in DMGs is determined by a shift in relative or total abundance of respective H3wt- and H3K27M- histones. We posit that changes in H3K27ac manifest as shifts in nucleosome integration with genes responsible for cell survival\/death. This project will profile differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from Quis-treated PBT22 and PBT29. Additionally, total and relative abundance of H3 proteins (wt and mt, me, me2, me3, and ac) from treated cells will be determined. Gene ontology analysis will focus on pathways accounting for chromatin remodeling, cell death, and growth arrest. RNA (qRT-PCR) and proteins (western blot) from analytes from a larger panel of DMG cell lines and neural stem cells treated with Quis will be used to validate the findings. Overall, the data depicts DMG preclinical models with large differential sensitivity to Quis, which may be partially due to different oncoprints between the models. The markedly different sensitivity of these models enables mechanistic study of the consequences of elevated abundance of histone 3 acetylation. The long term goal is to discover a molecular profile of DMGs indicative of the vulnerability to HDACi.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-04 Epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"HDAC inhibitor,Pediatric Cancers,Apoptosis,Cancer genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Danyelle Paine<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nanyun Tang<sup>1<\/sup>, Yue Hao<sup>1<\/sup>, Matt Biery<sup>2<\/sup>, Carrie Meyers<sup>3<\/sup>, Alyssa Noll<sup>3<\/sup>, Nicholas Vitanza<sup>3<\/sup>, Michael Berens<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>TGen (The Translational Genomics Research Institute), Phoenix, AZ,<sup>2<\/sup>Seattle Childrens Hospital, Seattle, WA,<sup>3<\/sup>Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"43fc4cbf-f6ed-432d-ba5b-2fff94d8a3c3","ControlNumber":"7411","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

However, it is unclear when methylation aberrance starts and how it interacts with other epigenomic modifications. To address how epigenomic changes occur and interact during the transformation from normal healthy colon tissue to malignant colorectal cancer (CRC), we collected 51 samples from 15 familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and non-FAP colorectal cancer patients. We generated 30-70x of whole-genome enzymatic methylation sequencing (WGEM-seq) data via the novel Ultima Genomics ultra high-throughput sequencing platform. We observed hypermethylation and hypomethylation emerge early in the malignant transformation process in gene promoters and distal regulatory elements. We performed multifaceted analysis on methylation alterations with whole-genome sequencing (WGS), transposase accessibility (ATAC-seq), high-resolution chromatin accessibility (Tri-C), and gene expression (RNA-seq) data. Our multidimensional analysis demonstrates how collectively epigenomic alterations have affected gene expression throughout normal colon mucosa, benign and dysplasia polyps to adenocarcinoma. Epigenomic changes start as early as benign polyps, followed by other epigenomic shifts, including bivalent domains. Various epigenomic aberrances are associated with concomitant gene expression level changes. Our integrative analysis of multi-epigenomics data implicates collective and cumulative epigenomic instability in the early onset of colon carcinogenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Epigenomics,Methylation abnormality,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hayan Lee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Gat Krieger<sup>2<\/sup>, Tyson Clark<sup>2<\/sup>, Yizhou Zhu<sup>3<\/sup>, Aziz Khan<sup>3<\/sup>, Casey  R.

This malignancy is driven, in part, by epigenetic reprogramming of the chromatin landscape directed by &#946;-catenin in complex with CREB-binding protein (CBP) and mixed lineage leukemia methyltransferase 1 (MLL1). The &#946;-catenin\/CBP\/MLL1 complex promotes an open chromatin structure by enabling transcription of genes associated with cell plasticity, including cancer stem cells and cells with partial EMT (p-EMT) phenotypes. Growing evidence indicates that cell plasticity and cellular senescence are integral processes shared by cancer and aging. Given that the median age of OSCC diagnosis is 66 years, it is likely that aging promotes OSCC evolution to advanced disease.<br \/>To examine the effects of aging on OSCC evolution, we adapted a syngeneic mouse model of tobacco-associated oral carcinogenesis. This model utilizes a mouse cell line, 4MOSC1, derived from 4-nitroquinoline-1 oxide- (4NQO)-induced tongue tumor which, when implanted into mouse tongues, generates tumors that recapitulate human OSCC mutanome. The growth of 4MOSC1 derived orthotopic tumors was studied in 6- and 80-week-old mice. Tumors were allowed to develop for 18 days, after which they were harvested and processed for single cell RNA sequencing, histopathology and immunofluorescence (IF) analyses.<br \/>Results showed that tumors grew at a faster rate and to a greater overall size in old mice compared to their young cohorts. OSCC harvested from the old mice displayed statistically significant reduction in membranous E-cadherin concomitant with increased Cbp and H3K4me3 abundance, suggesting an age-associated upregulation of &#946;-catenin\/Cbp\/Mll1 epigenetic activity. Increased expression of Bmi1, keratin 14, and podoplanin supported increased cell plasticity in OSCC from aged mice. Further, these tumors exhibited augmented cellular senescence, as judged by the disruption of lamin B1-associated nuclear membrane integrity, and by an increased cell population with markers of senescence from single cell sequencing analyses.<br \/>These data suggest that aging is associated with increased &#946;-catenin\/Cbp\/Mll1 epigenetic signaling, cell plasticity and cellular senescence, which collectively contribute to the evolution of OSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-06 Histone modification,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chromatin remodeling,Aging,Oral cancers,Senescence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Emily  R.

The methyl donor SAM and the demethylase inhibitor 2-HG increased after 15- and 30-min OA exposure, respectively; PHGDH inhibitor blocked these increases likely via effects on 1C metabolism. H3K4me3 CUT&#38;RUN revealed 661 differential peaks (FDR &#60; 0.05) comparing OA to control. The genes associated with these peaks are involved in neuron differentiation, neural crest, EMT and neural genes expressed in ERnegBC. 73% of H3K4me3 OA-associated peaks were in regulatory regions of OA-induced genes (FDR &#60; 0.01), including NGFR (log2FC = 11.7), NGF (log2FC = 8), NTRK1 (log2FC = 2.1). OA-induced genes with enriched H3K4me3 peaks were also upregulated in breast organoids exposed to OA, such as NGFR (FC = 2.2), NGF (FC = 4.7), NTRK1 (FC = 6.6). Motif analysis revealed an overrepresentation of transcription factors (p &#60; 0.05) associated with EMT (Zeb1, Slug), neural functions (E2A, AP1, JunB), neuronal-injury (Atf3) and stress response (Chop, Atf4). Twelve H3K27me3 peaks were enriched in control (FDR &#60; 0.05) and associated with increased gene expression in OA, among them were LGR6 (log2FC = 1.9), a gene associated with ERnegBC and PLAG1 (log2FC = 2.8) a stem cell marker. ALDH+ cells&#8217; percentage increased by at least 10% after OA exposure.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>. Lipid exposure affects the production of SAM and 2-HG, which results in epigenetic fostered plasticity, leading to reprogramming\/selecting cells with a multi-potential embryonic or stem-like state and\/or differentiation to a neural\/neural crest-like state which may facilitate ERnegBC genesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-06 Histone modification,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenomics,Lipid metabolism,Breast,Cancer prevention,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mariana Bustamante Eduardo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Gannon Cottone<sup>1<\/sup>, Shiyu Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Seema Khan<sup>1<\/sup>, Susan Clare<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Northwestern Univ.

The &#947;-globin genes (G&#947;- and A&#947;-) are expressed during fetal life and replaced by adult &#946;-globin after birth. Mutations in the &#946;-globin gene cause &#946;-hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease (SCD) and &#946;-thalassemia. The clinical severity of SCD and &#946;-thalassemia can be mitigated by elevated fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels, which have been found in individuals with the benign hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) syndrome. Thus, reactivating the expression of &#947;-globin genes is an attractive treatment strategy for &#946;-hemoglobinopathies. Reactivation of &#947;-globin expression by disrupting the binding of the <i>BCL11A<\/i> transcriptional repressor complex to the &#947;-globin gene promoter, provides a novel approach for inducing fetal hemoglobin.<br \/><b>Methodology:<\/b> The <i>BCL11A<\/i> binds a 5&#8242;-TGACCA-3&#8242; element (spanning nucleotides &#8722;118 to &#8722;113) of globin genes using its three C-terminal Zinc fingers (<i>Znf<\/i>).

Up to now, there is no specific treatment or diagnostic biomarkers for this tumor. The identification and characterization of miRNAs signature could help to its management. In addition, miRNAs represent targets for therapies due to their ability to modulate various signaling pathways simultaneously. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects of genetic manipulation of <i>miR-34a<\/i> and <i>miR-181b<\/i> on their predicted target genes in LMS cells.<br \/>Methods: SK-UT-1 cells from uterine LMS were transfected with synthetic miRNA mimics and inhibitors (siRNA) of <i>miR-34a<\/i> and <i>miR-181b<\/i>. The efficacy of transfection was assessed by miRNA expression (qRT-PCR) assays. In order to identify potential genetic interactions network of <i>miR-34a <\/i>and <i>181b<\/i>, predicted target genes were selected by in silico analysis (miRTargetLink 2.0 and miRDB). After SK-UT-1 cells transfection, the expression of target genes was evaluated by qRT-PCR.<br \/>Results: SK-UT-1 cells showed greater efficiency of mimics and siRNA transfections after 48h treatment for both <i>miR-34a<\/i><i> <\/i>and <i>181b<\/i>. <i>MDM4, TP53, BCL2, KMT2D, NOTCH2,<\/i> and <i>CCND1 <\/i>were identified as predicted target genes of <i>miR-34a<\/i>; and the <i>TIMP3, FGFR1, BCL2, NOTCH2, ATM<\/i>, and <i>IRS1<\/i> target genes for <i>miR-181b<\/i>.

Unlike normal muscle cells, RMS cells fail to differentiate despite expression of the myogenic determination protein MYOD. The TWIST2 transcription factor is frequently overexpressed in fusion-negative RMS (FN-RMS). TWIST2 blocks differentiation by inhibiting MYOD activity in myoblasts, but its role in FN-RMS pathogenesis is incompletely understood. Here, we show that knockdown of TWIST2 enables FN-RMS cells to exit the cell cycle and undergo terminal myogenesis. TWIST2 knockdown also substantially reduces tumor growth in a xenograft model of FN-RMS. Mechanistically, TWIST2 controls H3K27 acetylation at distal enhancers by interacting with the chromatin remodelers SMARCA4 and CHD3 to activate growth-related and repress myogenesis-related target genes, respectively.

BRD4 is functionally versatile and has extensively been studied for its role in cell cycle progression, gene transcription regulation, chromatin organization and remodeling, as well as DNA replication and repair . In addition, BRD4 has been implicated in many solid and liquid tumors, and its inhibition shows promising preclinical activity, especially in hematopoietic malignancies. BRD4 is overexpressed in Leukemia and has been reported to play a role in hematopoietic stem cell expansion and progenitor development. However, the mechanisms of BRD4 in hematopoietic stem cell functions and disease development remain poorly understood. Using BRD44 knockout (BRD44 &#916;\/&#916; , driven by Mx1 Cre to delete BRD44 in hematopoietic system) mouse model, we found that BRD4 is required for HSCs self-renewal and the loss of BRD44 impaired erythroid differentiation and skewed myeloid differentiation. BRD44 &#916;\/&#916; HSPCs showed G0\/G1 arrest, decreased S-phase, and increased senescence compared to wild type (WT) HSPCs. Our study demonstrates that BRD4 is essential for normal hematopoiesis. To further investigate the role of BRD4 in hematopoiesis, we generated BRD44 transgenic mice (driven by Vav1 promoter, to assure all BRD44 transgene expression is instructed in the hematopoietic system). Ongoing studies focus on determining the impact of BRD4 overexpression on hematopoietic stem cell functions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRD4,Epigenetics,Leukemias,Stem cells,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Francine Nihozeko<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Cells System and Anatomy (Cancer Biology), UT Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"28e34805-d7e5-4353-b786-3797968875a6","ControlNumber":"2612","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>F.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which makes up ~85% of lung cancer cases, is mainly treated with radiotherapy, chemotherapies, and targeted agents. Targeted agents are selected based on the mutation spectrum of the tumor. In NSCLC the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is commonly mutated and, leads to increased proliferation and cell survival. The standard-of-care treatment for patients with activating mutations in EGFR is treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as erlotinib. While tumors initially respond to TKIs, most patients develop resistance after 1-2 years. In ~60% of TKI resistant tumors, resistance is the result of a secondary mutation in EGFR, whereas, in the remaining 20%, tumors turn on bypass track-signals to overcome inhibition of the EGFR pathway. In the remaining 15-20% of the cases the mechanisms underlying resistance are unknown. Most studies focus on the gain of function of oncogenes as mediators of resistance; however, little is known about the role that tumor suppressors play in TKI resistance. Hence, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR Cas9 knock-out screen to identify genes that when knocked-out would drive erlotinib resistance. Fold enrichment analysis of sgRNAs, identified KMT5C as a top candidate. KMT5C is a histone methyltransferase that trimethylates H4K20 (H4K20me3), enabling the establishment of constitutive and facultative heterochromatin. The process by which KMT5C is reduced in tumors is unknown, yet data from human samples suggests that the <i>KMT5C<\/i> transcript is globally downregulated in NSCLC and in tumor samples resistant to the third-generation TKI osimertinib. Additionally, loss of the modification made by KMT5C (H4K20me3), influences the prognosis of NSCLC, indicating that loss of KMT5C function is a crucial mechanism in carcinogenesis. We recently described how loss of KMT5C leads to increased transcription of the oncogene MET, due to a loss in H4K20me3-mediated repression of a long non-coding RNA transcription (LINC01510) upstream of MET. This mechanism was found to be responsible for driving TKI resistance in EGFR mutant cells. Historically, KMT5C has been associated with generation of constitutive heterochromatin (cHC); however, recent reports, including our own, indicate that KMT5C also regulates transcription in regions outside of cHC. Our preliminary evidence suggests that deposition of H42K0me3 via KMT5C in regions outside of cHC, is less stable than in cHC regions. This novel finding led us to hypothesize that regulation of KMT5C and H42K0me3 at different regions of heterochromatin is a dynamic process, and future work will aim at understanding this process and its relevance in cancer progression and TKI resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-06 Histone modification,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Histone modification,EGFR TKI resistance,Lung cancer: non-small cell,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alejandra Agredo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Arpita Pal<sup>2<\/sup>, Jihye Son<sup>2<\/sup>, Nadia  A.

One critical mechanism is that tumor cells can progress to AR-indifferent stem cell-like (SCL-PCa or SCLPC) or neuroendocrine-like CRPC (NE-PCa or NEPC) through lineage plasticity. However, the underlying molecular basis remains to be determined, and clinical treatment options for these aggressive CRPC subtypes are currently limited. FOXA1 and FOXA2, which are members of the FOXA (Forkhead Box A) protein family, are pioneer transcription factors. While FOXA1 is well known for its function as a critical pioneer factor of AR and pivotal for maintaining AR signaling, the molecular function of FOXA2 in PCa cells is poorly understood despite that FOXA2 is known to be overexpressed in NEPC. Moreover, since FOXA2, like FOXA1, is currently undruggable in the clinic, there is an urgent need to decipher the molecular basis for the chromatin binding of FOXA2 and identify druggable targets that regulate FOXA2 binding and activity in the aggressive FOXA2-positive CRPC.<br \/>Methods: In the current study, we first examined the role of FOXA2 in tumorigenesis and metastasis by using various <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> assays including mouse subcutaneous injection and zebrafish embryo injection approaches. We then conducted integrated whole genomic transcriptome and cistrome analyses in SCLPC and NEPC cell line models to characterize the activity of FOXA2 on chromatin and to identify its collaborating transcription factors that may play specific functions in promoting SCLPC or NEPC using a series of biochemical and bioinformatic approaches.<br \/>Results: We found that FOXA2 silencing decreased the growth and metastasis of SCLPC and NEPC cells. Importantly, we discovered that FOXA2 chromatin binding is tightly associated with binding of JUN family proteins (primarily c-Jun) and FOXA2 silencing dramatically interrupted the global chromatin binding of c-Jun and FOSL1. The transcription targets of FOXA2\/AP-1 are highly enriched for neuroendocrine and plasticity associated genes and associated with poor clinical outcomes. Furthermore, we also found that FOXA2 chromatin binding is globally enhanced by an epigenetic factor LSD1, and LSD1 inhibition can repress FOXA2\/AP-1 activity in multiple CRPC models.<br \/>Conclusion: Overall,<b> <\/b>our data indicate that FOXA2 functions to maintain tumor growth and metastasis in SCLPC and NEPC models. Mechanistically, FOXA2 can act as a pioneer factor of AP-1 (c-Jun\/FOSL1) and reprogram AP-1 transcription activity. This FOXA2\/AP-1 axis is regulated by LSD1 via demethylating FOXA2 protein and LSD1 inhibition represses FOXA2-dependent CRPC tumor progression. These findings provide novel mechanistic insights into the molecular mechanisms for PCa lineage plasticity and treatment resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-01 Chromatin structure and function,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"LSD1,Neuroendocrine differentiation,Prostate cancer,Transcription factor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zifeng Wang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mingyu Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Songqi Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Muqing Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Susan Patalano<sup>1<\/sup>, Jill  A.

The mainstay of treatment for AML includes chemotherapy, but the response of a subset of patients to current treatment options remains poor. Thus, new therapeutic approaches are desperately needed. AML often arises from somatic mutations in chromatin regulators that result in uncontrolled proliferation and a block of differentiation in myeloid progenitor cells. As such, investigation of the role and molecular mechanism of chromatin regulator in AML is being actively pursued. Previously, we discovered the eleven-nineteen-leukemia (ENL) protein, a chromatin &#8220;reader&#8221; and transcription co-activator, as an unrecognized requirement for the survival of AML. We developed a potent and orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of ENL, which displaces ENL from chromatin and blocks AML progression. Hotspot mutations have been found in ENL YEATS domains, both in Wilms tumor and in leukemia, and these mutations confer a gain of condensation property, leading to aberrant gene activation. However, the impact of ENL mutation on tumorigenesis is largely unknown. The over-arching goal of this project is to explore the impact of the hyper-activated ENL pathway (ENL mutation) in AML. Results from this project will elucidate how newly discovered chromatin reader mutations drive tumorigenesis and offer new biology insights that will facilitate both basic mechanistic studies and clinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute myeloid,Tumorigenesis,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yiman Liu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Qinglan Li<sup><\/sup>, Sylvia Tang<sup><\/sup>, Chujie Gong<sup><\/sup>, Liling Wan<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"dc18fb25-f187-485b-904c-553117e7b8a6","ControlNumber":"4831","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Epigenetic modifications at the chromatin level have widely been linked to carcinogenesis. Epigenetic regulation not only contributes to the development of cancer, but it may also confer resistance to therapies by promoting the survival of clones that can overcome treatment-induced stress or give rise to complex tumor heterogeneity in response to cancer therapy. Investigating susceptibility resulting from epigenetic aberrations in tumor cells may reveal novel markers of therapies that target epigenetic aberrations. In this study, we treated NSCLC organoid models with a library of 41 epigenetic probes to identify epigenetic targets that affect tumor cell survival.<br \/>Methods: Epigenetic screen. NSCLC organoid models were established from resected patient tumors or patient-derived xenografts. Organoids were dissociated into single cells and plated in matrigel-coated 384-well plate. Each model was treated with a library of epigenetic probes (1uM) and a DMSO control over a period of 8 days. Library was provided by Structural Genomics Consortium (www.thesgc.org) and contained compounds targeting a variety of protein domains some of which had activity on acetylation, methylation, histone de-methylation etc. CellTiter-Glo assay was performed to measure cell survival.<br \/>Results: Among the epigenetic probe compounds tested on 26 models, LLY 283 (PRMT5 inhibitor) showed the most significant effect on inhibition of cell growth in 69% of organoid models<br \/>(18\/26) with suppression of &#62;=40% as compared to the DMSO control. To assess differential responses to treatment with LLY 283, four organoid models were treated with 21 different concentrations of PRMT5 inhibitor. Growth curves of a sensitive (XDO181) and a less sensitive (XDO4056) models were compared. For XDO181 and XDO4056, IC50 values were calculated to be 4.7 nM and 31.8 nM respectively, indicating that a less sensitive model is associated with a 7-fold increase in IC50 value compared to the sensitive model.<br \/>Conclusion: A screen using epigenetic compounds on NSCLC patient-derived organoids revealed sensitivity to PRMT5 inhibitor in 69% of the organoid models tested. Further investigation will explore the mechanisms that are associated with sensitivity to PRMT5 inhibition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Epigenetics,Organoids,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Khadija Jafarova<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Panagiotis Prinos<sup>2<\/sup>, Nikolina Radulovich<sup>3<\/sup>, Takamasa Koga<sup>3<\/sup>, Cheryl Arrowsmith<sup>2<\/sup>, Geoffrey Liu<sup>3<\/sup>, Ming Sound Tsao<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada,<sup>2<\/sup>Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada,<sup>3<\/sup>Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"26d24e83-5032-411c-a160-674f9d419e41","ControlNumber":"3574","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

H3K36 modifications play an important role in regulating the function and structure of chromatin, affecting transcription, replication, and repair. Abnormal H3K36 methylation is often detected during tumor development and progression. Inactivating NSD1 mutations are frequent in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). They commonly occur in HPV-negative oropharyngeal (OP) and laryngeal (LC) carcinomas, and define a prognostic subtype in LC, associated with significantly improved overall and progression-free survival. Notably, the SCC4 cell line, carrying a damaging mutation in the <i>NSD1<\/i> gene demonstrated reduced dimethylation level of H3K36 compared to NSD1 wild-type HNSCC counterparts. To explore the biological impact of the NSD1\/NSD2 loss of function in HNSCC, we established cell lines with doxycycline-inducible shRNA knockdown of NSD1 and NSD2 in the set of HNSCC cell lines originating from different sites (JHU011, JHU022, Cal27, and FaDu cell lines). The depletion of NSD1 and NSD2 led to reduction of K36me2, significant decrease in cell growth as measured by cell titer blue (CTB) and clonogenic assays. NSD1\/NSD2 depletion in these HNSCC cells also caused a significant increase in apoptosis. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of RNA-seq for NSD1 wt versus knockdown cells indicates that NSD1 knockdown reduced expression of E2F target genes. Among the E2F transcription factor family, E2F2 gene expression was significantly decreased in all NSD1 knockdown cell lines. NSD1 knockdown also activated gene pathways related to autophagy and response to starvation. NSD1 knockdown reduced the levels of autophagy initiation gene ULK1 at both mRNA and protein levels. We also probed for protein signaling in HNSCC cells following NSD1 depletion using a reverse protein phase array (RPPA) approach, and validated Phosphatidylinositol-5-Phosphate 4-Kinase Type 2 Beta (PIP4K2B), but not other members of this family (PIP4K2A and PIP4K2C), as NSD1-regulated. PIP4K2B was regulated at the mRNA level by NSD1 as well. The CHIP-qPCR assay demonstrated the loss of H3K36me2 at the promoter of the PIP4K2B gene in NSD1 knockdown cells, suggesting direct regulation by NSD1. Moreover, PIP4K2B siRNA depletion has also led to a significant decrease in HNSCC proliferation, which suggests that the NSD1 may regulate proliferative activity through PIP4K2B. Taken together, while this data supports the suggestion that NSD histone methyltransferases have multiple downstream targets, the underlying mechanism remain to be investigated in more detail. Further, NSD proteins are attractive targets for drug development for improving treatment strategies for HNSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-06 Histone modification,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Histone methylation,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Proliferation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Iuliia Topchu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Igor Bychkov<sup>1<\/sup>, Petr Makhov<sup>2<\/sup>, Evgeny Izumchenko<sup>3<\/sup>, John Karanicolas<sup>2<\/sup>, Jindan Yu<sup>1<\/sup>, Jochen Lorch<sup>1<\/sup>, Yanis Boumber<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Robert H.

Despite the strong association of hypoxia and PDAC, the relationship between KRAS and hypoxia is still poorly understood. The oxygen-sensitive histone lysine demethylase, KDM5A, was recently reported to mediate epigenetic responses to hypoxia independent of the hypoxia-inducible factors. KDM5A epigenetically represses transcription via two mechanisms: by its demethylase activity on activating H3K4me3 marks, and through its interaction with deacetylase complexes containing HDAC1\/2, which deacetylates activating H3K9ac and H4K16ac histone marks. Under hypoxic conditions, KDM5A loses its activity, leading to restoration of these H3K4me3 marks, thereby activating KDM5A target genes. The purpose of this study is to understand how KDM5A loss of function contributes to pathogenesis of mutant KRAS-driven pancreatic cancer.<br \/>Methods: Cell lines derived from mice with pancreas-specific p53 deletion and doxycycline-inducible expression of Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> (iKPC). Protein lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer. Histones were purified by acid extraction. Immunoblotting was used to probe for protein levels of Kdm5a, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, and H4K16ac. Genetic ablation of Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> was performed by culturing iKPCs in tetracycline-free medium. Kras was induced by adding doxycycline to the culture medium. Pharmaceutical inhibition of MEK, proteasome, and Kdm5a were performed by treating iKPCs with mirdametinib, MG-132, and CPI-455, respectively. Knockdown of &#946;-TrCP and FBXW7 were performed by stable expression of shRNA in iKPCs. Protein motif scanning was performed using the Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) Prediction online software.<br \/>Results: We discovered that Kdm5a protein levels were abrogated by induction of Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup> and stabilized by genetic ablation of Kras. Pharmaceutical inhibition of MEK or proteasome function stabilized Kdm5a, indicating that Kras induces Kdm5a proteasomal degradation through the MEK\/ERK pathway. H3K4me3, H3K9ac, and H4K16ac histone marks were increased in Kras-on iKPC compared to Kras-off iKPC, consistent the expected effect of Kras-induced Kdm5a degradation. Pharmaceutical inhibition Kdm5a in the Kras-off setting restored H3K4me3, suggesting that Kdm5a contributes to demethylation of H3K4me3 in iKPC. We identified two phosphodegron sites corresponding to &#946;-TrCP and FBXW7 of the ubiquitin ligase complex within the Kdm5a protein sequence. Knockdown of either &#946;-TrCP or FBXW7 in iKPC both stabilized Kdm5a despite induction of Kras.<br \/>Conclusion: We conclude that Kdm5a plays a tumor suppressor role in pancreatic cancer by epigenetically repressing transcriptional programs necessary for KRAS-driven oncogenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-06 Histone modification,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pancreatic cancer,KRAS,Histone methylation,ERK,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jasper R.

It has a history of great rates of success in treatment, but adults and infants still share a dismal prognosis. This condition makes the development of new prognostic markers linked to effective therapeutic strategies a matter of pressing concern. While cancer has traditionally been viewed as a genetic disease derived from alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors, it is well known nowadays that epigenetic changes also play a fundamental role in tumorigenesis. The SET family of lysine methyltransferases (KMT) has been implicated in a number of cancers, and <i>SETD4<\/i> is a member that is still poorly characterized. In the present study we used qPCR to analyze the expression pattern of <i>SETD4<\/i> among 83 pediatric ALL patients and non-neoplastic bone marrow (BM) samples and investigated the correlation between <i>SETD4<\/i> transcription changes with the leukemic burden in ALL patients during chemotherapy. We found that <i>SETD4<\/i> transcription levels are significantly upregulated in BM samples derived from ALL patients compared to non-neoplastic BM (8,5-fold higher, <i>p<\/i> &#60; 0,001) and its expression correlated with leukemic burden. Importantly, levels of <i>SETD4<\/i> decreased in patients that responded to chemotherapy treatment. We further investigated whether <i>SETD4 <\/i>transcription levels associates with that of <i>SMYD2<\/i>, another KMT previously identified as a prognostic marker in ALL. Transcription levels of <i>SETD4<\/i> and <i>SMYD2 <\/i>were examined on day 15<sup>th<\/sup> and 29<sup>th<\/sup> of chemotherapy. Surprisingly, a high level of correlation (Spearman <i>r<\/i> = 0.925, <i>p<\/i> &#60; 0.01) between both genes was observed in both treatment time points. Finally, survival outcomes were worst in ALL patients with high levels of <i>SETD4<\/i> transcription (log-rank test, p &#60; 0,05), evidencing its dysregulated expression is associated with an unfavorable disease prognosis. Together, these results point to <i>SETD4<\/i> as a useful prognostic marker, a possible tool to assess response to therapy and an attractive target for drug development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Leukemias: acute lymphoblastic,Epigenetics,Gene expression,Prognosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Luis Augusto Muniz Telles<sup><\/sup>, Luis Henrique Toshihiro Sakamoto<sup><\/sup>, Alan Jhones Barbosa de Assis<sup><\/sup>, Doralina de Amaral Ramos Rabello<sup><\/sup>, Andrea Barretto Motoyama<sup><\/sup>, <b>Fabio Pittella-Silva<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Faculty of Health Sciences and Medicine, University of Brasilia, Brasilia, Brazil","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b61ebf26-b472-4143-b6a4-e773e1fb1ebd","ControlNumber":"2898","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

Many prostate cancer therapeutics target the androgen signaling pathway, although tumors invariably become resistant to these treatments. EP300 and CBP are protein paralogs that are co-regulators of AR-mediated gene transcription and are mutated at low frequency in prostate cancers. Expression of CBP and EP300 has been found to correlate with AR expression in advanced disease, and their inhibition can impact AR-mediated transcription in model systems. However, both proteins are not equally essential in prostate cancer cell lines. As drugs inhibiting the bromodomains of these proteins are in early clinical trials, a greater understanding of the common and unique functions of EP300 and CBP may inform the clinical application of these therapeutics. Using chemical inhibition or degradation of either each paralog or both, in combination with genetic depletion, we identify converging and diverging epigenomic and transcriptional programs regulated by each paralog both in the presence and absence of androgens. If validated in tumor samples from patients, these results may nominate biomarkers of response to EP300\/CBP inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-04 Epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Androgen receptor,p300,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kiran Mirpuri<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Alok  K.

CNS-directed therapy is currently limited to agents associated with substantial neurotoxicity and the lack of mechanistic understanding of how ALL cells infiltrate the CNS is preventing novel therapy development. Our laboratory has previously shown in murine xenografts that ALL cells with a point mutation (E1099K) in the histone methyltransferase NSD2 aggressively infiltrate not only the leptomeninges of the brain, but also the brain parenchyma. Accordingly, we also showed that NSD2-E1099K cells have an enhanced ability to migrate through a Boyden chamber and adhere to endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier (BBB cells). Furthermore, RNA-seq data on four NSD2-E1099K cell lines revealed genes that may play a role in ALL brain infiltration. However, it remains unknown which of the genes upregulated by NSD2 could be potential therapeutic targets against CNS leukemia.<br \/><b>Aim:<\/b> This study aims to identify therapeutically targetable genes that are important for (1) migration of ALL cells through a Boyden chamber, (2) adhesion of ALL cells to BBB cells, and (3) intercellular signaling between ALL and BBB cells.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We used a focused CRISPR-gene-knockout library targeting 500 genes upregulated in NSD2-E1099K cells to ascertain genes important for migration in the RCHACV cell line. Next, we used the genome-wide Brunello library to identify genes critical for ALL cell adhesion to BBB cells. To study intercellular communication between ALL and BBB cells, we co-cultured SEM-WT or SEM-NSD2-E1099K cells with BBB cells for 48h. ALL cells were then isolated from BBB cells using CD19+ magnetic beads and all groups were further processed for RNA-seq.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our CRISPR screen studies identified genes whose knockout led to enhancement of migration or adhesion, as well as genes whose knockout resulted in inhibition of migration or adhesion. One of the top candidate genes identified in the migration screen was PTPRG. Validation studies with shRNA and CRISPRa constructs confirmed that PTPRG is a modulator of migration and adhesion in NSD2-E1099K ALL cells. In addition, RNA-seq studies identified important differences in how SEM-WT (low-CNS infiltrating) and SEM-NSD2-E1099K (high-CNS infiltrating) cells communicate with BBB cells. Specifically, our analysis predicted that IL1B secretion of SEM-NSD2-E1099K cells, but not SEM-WT cells, leads to increased IL1B target gene expression in BBB cells, potentially contributing to CNS infiltration.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> Our findings implicate PTPRG and the IL1B pathway as important modulators of migration and adhesion or intercellular signaling, respectively. These genes may have the potential to be novel therapeutic target for preventing ALL brain infiltration.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Migration,Cell signaling,Adhesion,CRISPR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Charlotte  L.

The MED-kinase module consists of four subunits, MED12\/12L, MED13\/13L, CDK8\/19 and Cyclin C, and reversibly interacts with the MED-core complex to function as a lineage-specific transcriptional activator. In particular, MED12 has been reported to recruit BRD4, FLI\/ERG, CBP\/p300, and GATA2 transcription factors on H3K27ac-enriched super-enhancer (SE) loci in hematopoietic stem and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells to maintain cell fate determination or leukemic growth respectively. Given the regulatory role MED12 in AML, there is a sustained interest in identifying targeted inhibitors against this MED-protein. Herein, we aimed to investigate if the oncogenic over-expression of MED12 is epigenetically regulated in AML. We analyzed the MED12 transcriptomic data in AML patients, belongs to 6 cytogenetic subgroups having chromosomal aberrations such as inv(16) (n=28), t(15;17) (n=37), t(8;21) (n=40), MLL-rearranged (n=38), AML-complex (n=48), and normal karyotype (n=351), compared to normal bone marrow (NBM) mononuclear cells (n=73), from the Microarray Innovations in Leukemia (MILE) study (Stage I). MED12 was found significantly (p&#60;0.01) upregulated in AML subgroups, except for the AML-complex subgroup along 3 probe sets (211342_x_at, 203506_s_at, and 216071_x_at). The highest upregulation of MED12 was observed in the inv(16) subgroup having the mean differential expression of 0.78, followed by 0.57 in t(8;21) and 0.5 in t(15;17) subgroup, compared to NBM. Considering the fact that inv(16) and t(8;21) subgroups showed highest expression of the gene, and are categorized as the core-binding factor (CBF) AML-subgroups, we examined DNA-methylation and chromatin modifications of MED12 in patients [n=3 for inv(16) and n=1 for t(8;21)], based on the whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data, as available at the BLUEPRINT epigenome, and DNAse sequencing (K562 cells) data at ENCODE. We observed DNAse hypersensitive peaks at the exon-26 and a region (229 bp) spanning the transcription start site (TSS) and upstream promoter of the gene, indication an open chromatin conformation. The TSS and upstream promoter also contained a broad H3K4me3 domain [1.7 kb in inv(16) and 1.2 kb in t(8;21)], with an overlapping hypomethylated CpG-island. Collectively, our findings suggest that MED12 oncogenic over-expression in CBF AML-subgroups are fostered by an epigenetically active promoter. Future studies will be aimed at understanding the impact of targeted perturbation of MED12 in the enhancer mechanism and sustenance of leukemic growth in CBF AML-subgroups.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-03 Epigenetic changes as molecular markers of cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenetics,Acute myeloid leukemia,Epigenomics,Gene expression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Samrat Roy Choudhury<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Arkajyoti Bhattacharya<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR,<sup>2<\/sup>University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1d7f724d-a2ef-4324-9bb2-b2618b72291c","ControlNumber":"5102","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Osteosarcoma therapy has not change in over forty years, highlighting the need for deeper molecular understanding of this disease which could in turn identify new therapeutic opportunities. While DNA-level heterogeneity between tumors has been well-described, not much is known regarding epigenetic heterogeneity within osteosarcoma and how this may impact critical phenotypes such as therapy response and metastasis. To characterize the osteosarcoma epigenome, we integrated ATAC-seq and RNA-seq across a unique set of patient samples, PDXs and PDX-derived cell lines obtained across the disease continuum including biopsies, resections, and metastases. ATAC-seq analysis revealed the presence of at least two distinct epigenetic cell states, epigenetic cluster 1 (EC1) and epigenetic cluster 2 (EC2). We used the GREAT algorithm to identify enriched pathways for the genes linked to these differential open regions (~2000 unique peaks per EC). EC1 is defined by genes related to mesenchymal cell proliferation and osteoblast differentiation, whereas EC2 is enriched in genes related to extracellular matrix organization and regulation of kinase activity. Accessible chromatin peaks in EC1 showed transcription factor binding motifs related to development including RUNX2\/3, MEOX2, HOXA2\/5 and DLX; whereas members of the AP1 complex including FOSL1\/2, c-FOS, JUN were enriched in open regions in EC2. This is correlated with high protein expression of these transcription factors in a cluster-specific manner and differential binding to chromatin. We defined a gene-signature of 343 genes by integrating differential open chromatin with differential gene expression of EC1 and EC2. This gene-signature is able to separate gene expression data of patient samples into 2 clusters, suggesting these epigenetic cell states are found in patient samples. We assigned the patient samples to one EC and performed a survival analysis using only primary patient samples. EC1 shows a lower survival probability than EC2. To identify possible therapeutic implications of these EC, we evaluated a drug response dataset generated with ~40 targeted agents for the same panel of PDX-cell lines. Whereas EC1 cell lines were highly sensitive to a selective inhibitor of Aurora B, cell lines in EC2 were inhibited by a MEK inhibitor. PDX-cell lines injected in a subcutaneous model recapitulated the differential drug response in vivo. <\/i>In summary, we have identified two epigenetically cell states regulated by a state-specific set of transcription factors defining a gene signature that could help to define osteosarcoma subclasses and predict drug response.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-04 Epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,Epigenetics,Chromatin accessibility,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Eunice Lopez Fuentes<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Andrew Clugston<sup>1<\/sup>, Leanne Sayles<sup>1<\/sup>, Maria Pons Ventura<sup>1<\/sup>, Alex Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Vijay Ramani<sup>2<\/sup>, E.

This study is the first to demonstrate how the hypoxic increment of methylated histones cross-talks with other epigenetic changes, such as histone clipping and heterochromatin redistribution, named senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF), which are found during oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). Raf-activation in primary human fibroblasts IMR90 increases mature cathepsin L (CTSL)-mediated clipping of histone H3, H2B and H4. Hypoxia protects histones from CTSL by increasing histone methylation without reducing the amount and activity of CTSL. Forced enhancement of methylated histones protected histones from clipping during OIS, even under normoxia, but failed to block SAHFs. Altogether, these results suggest that maintenance of methylated histones is sufficient to protect histones from CTSL, not sufficient but necessary for inhibiting SAHFs, suggesting that besides inhibiting KDMs, hypoxia adopts other mechanisms to inhibit SAHFs<b>. <\/b>Hypoxia protects histones and chromatin from dramatic epigenetic changes by increasing methylated histones.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB06-06 Histone modification,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hypoxia,Oncogene,Histone methylation,Senescence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hyunsung Park<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Soojeong Chang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Dept. of Life Science, University of Seoul, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4d647121-1fad-41ca-ace6-1f6ccf061e30","ControlNumber":"6030","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.
