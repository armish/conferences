LY3537982 is an oral, highly selective, and potent inhibitor of KRAS G12C, which preclinically delivers &#62;90% sustained target occupancy. We present the initial results from LOXO-RAS-20001, a phase 1 study of LY3537982 in patients (pts) with KRAS G12C-mutant advanced solid tumors (NCT04956640).<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: LY3537982 monotherapy dose escalation followed a mTPI-2 method. Dose expansion cohorts included combinations with pembrolizumab (NSCLC) and cetuximab (CRC). Key objectives were to determine the RP2D of LY3537982, safety, PK, and antitumor activity per RECIST v1.1.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>As of 17 August 2022, 56 pts with NSCLC (16), CRC (17), PANC (8), and other tumor types (15) were treated with LY3537982 monotherapy on doses from 50-200 mg BID. Median number of prior systemic therapies was 2 (range, 0-8). No DLTs were observed, MTD was not reached, and RP2D determination is ongoing. Median time on treatment was 3 months (range, 0.3-13), 33 pts are ongoing, and 23 pts discontinued (none due to a related AE). TEAEs observed in &#8805;10% of pts were diarrhea (38%), constipation (16%), fatigue (16%), peripheral oedema (13%), and nausea (11%), mostly grade 1. The only grade &#8805;3 treatment related AE was neutropenia (n=1), and no pneumonitis or grade &#8805;2 transaminitis was observed. There were no treatment related serious AEs or deaths. Dose proportional steady-state exposures were observed through 150 mg BID. Table shows preliminary efficacy data.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>LY3537982 demonstrated a favorable safety profile, including the absence of high-grade liver toxicity, and tolerance in pts previously intolerant to other KRAS G12C inhibitors. Preliminary efficacy was observed with LY3537982 monotherapy across multiple tumor types. Updated data in more than 100 pts, including data in combination with pembrolizumab and cetuximab will be presented.<br \/><b>Table: Preliminary LY3537982 Monotherapy Efficacy<\/b><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{081C115B-861F-48F3-BB1E-D21FA1C742AE}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>NSCLC <\/b><b>(KRAS G12Ci na&#239;ve)<\/b><b>(N=5)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>NSCLC<\/b><b>(Prior KRAS G12Ci treated)<\/b><b> (N=11)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>CRC<sup>d<\/sup><\/b><b>(N=17)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>PANC<sup>d<\/sup><\/b><b>(N=8)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Other tumor types<sup>d,f<\/sup><\/b><b>(N=15)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Efficacy Evaluable<sup>a<\/sup>,<sup> <\/sup>n<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">15<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">8<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">11<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ORR, n (%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3 (60%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1 (7%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3 (38%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4 (36%)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">BOR, n (%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PR, n (%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3 (60%)<sup>c<\/sup><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1 (7%)<sup>e<\/sup><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3 (38%)<sup>e<\/sup><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4 (36%)<sup>g<\/sup><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">SD, n (%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1 (20%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6 (67%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13 (87%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4 (50%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6 (55%)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PD, n (%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1 (20%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3 (33%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1 (7%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1 (13%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1 (9%)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">DCR<sup>b<\/sup>, n (%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4 (80%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6 (67%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">14 (93%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7 (88%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">10 (91%)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"6\">Abbreviations: CRC, colorectal cancer;

In a previously reported single-agent cohort, GDC-6036 achieved a best response of partial response or complete response in 35% (19\/55) of patients, with a confirmed overall response rate (ORR) of 24% (13\/55 patients) in <i>KRAS G12C<\/i>-positive CRC patients (Desai et. al., ESMO 2022). EGFR blockade may sensitize tumors to KRAS G12C inhibition and the combination of an anti-EGFR antibody (cetuximab) with a KRAS G12C inhibitor showed greater anti-tumor activity than single-agent KRAS G12C inhibition in preclinical models (Amodio et. al., 2020). <b>Methods: <\/b>In an ongoing Phase I study (NCT04449874), patients with advanced or metastatic <i>KRAS G12C<\/i>-positive CRC were administered GDC-6036 (200-400 mg orally once a day) with cetuximab (400 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> intravenously initially, then 250 mg\/m<sup>2<\/sup> weekly) until intolerable toxicity or disease progression. Endpoints included safety (NCI-CTCAE v5), pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary anti-tumor activity (RECIST v1.1). <b>Results:<\/b> As of the clinical data cut-off date of 21 Nov 2022, 29 patients (enrolled by 07 Oct 2022) had received GDC-6036 and cetuximab. The median lines of prior metastatic therapy was 2 (range 1-8) and the median time on study treatment was 5.2 (range 1.4-11.2) months. All patients experienced at least one treatment-related adverse event (TRAE); the most common TRAEs (&#8805;15%) were rash (grouped terms), diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dry skin, and paronychia. Grade 3-4 TRAEs occurred in 11 patients (38%). Five patients (17%) experienced at least one serious AE, none of which were treatment-related (including 2 patients who died of CRC progression during the safety follow-up). AEs led to GDC-6036 modifications (interruptions and\/or reductions) in 13 (45%) patients, dose reduction in 3 (10%) patients, and no patients discontinued due to AEs. Eleven patients discontinued from study treatment (10 due to disease progression and 1 due to physician&#8217;s discretion). The PK profile of GDC-6036 (400 mg once a day) was similar in combination with cetuximab when compared with single-agent. A partial response was achieved in 66% (19\/29) of patients, with a confirmed ORR of 62% (18\/29 patients). <b>Conclusions: <\/b>GDC-6036 in combination with cetuximab demonstrated a manageable safety profile and promising clinical activity. These data support that the addition of anti-EGFR therapy to GDC-6036 may lead to robust clinical benefit in patients with <i>KRAS G12C<\/i>-positive CRC. <i><\/i>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT04-01 Phase I adult clinical trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,KRAS,EGFR,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jayesh Desai<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sae-Won Han<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jong-Seok Lee<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Einat Shacham-Shmueli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Erminia Massarelli<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Andrés Cervantes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elena Garralda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alejandro Falcon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wilson H.

All 74 pts were included for safety analysis. No dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) were observed in any dose cohorts. The overall safety profile was consistent with the latest previous report, with no new safety signals identified. As of December 15th, 2022, among 67 response-evaluable NSCLC pts across all dose levels, the ORR (by investigator assessment) was 58.2% (95% CI, 45.5-70.2), and the confirmed ORR was 44.8% (95% CI, 32.6-57.4); the disease control rate (DCR) was 92.5% (95% CI, 83.4-97.5). At the 600mg BID dose level (RP2D), the ORR was 63.3% (95% CI, 43.9-80.1), and the confirmed ORR was 50.0% (95% CI, 31.3-68.7), the DCR was 96.7% (95% CI, 82.8-99.9). With a median progression-free survival (PFS) follow-up of 5.5 months (95% CI, 5.3-6.8) for NSCLC pts at the 600mg BID dose level, 21 (70%) pts were continuing treatments, and the median duration of response (DoR) and PFS were not reached. Thirteen out of 15 confirmed responders were still in response.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: IBI351 (GFH925) was well-tolerated across all doses explored in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring KRAS p.G12C mutation.

This study is investigating the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of BGB-3245 in patients (pts) with advanced or refractory MAPK-altered solid tumors.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Eligible pts were &#8805;18 yrs old with ECOG 0-1 and had solid tumors harboring MAPK pathway alterations. Dose-escalation and cohort-size decisions were made using the Modified Toxicity Probability Interval Design. The starting dose was 5 mg QD. Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were graded per NCI CTCAE v5.0. Tumor responses were assessed by investigators using RECIST v1.1.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>As of 1 Sep 2022, 42 pts were treated across 6 cohorts (5-60 mg QD). The median age was 60 yrs; pts had received a median of 3 prior lines of treatment. All pts had TEAEs; 79% had treatment-related (TR) AEs. The most common TRAEs (&#8805; 10%) were rash acneiform (33%), rash maculopapular (24%), fever (17%), ALT elevations and nausea (both 12%). Gr &#8805;3 TRAEs were reported in 29% of pts, events in &#8805; 2 pts included decreased platelet count and rash maculopapular (3 each), ALT and AST elevations, and fever (2 each). Dose reductions occurred in 5 pts: rhabdomyolysis (1), LVEF decreased (1), hand-foot syndrome (1), rash maculopapular (1), and liver function abnormalities (1). Dose interruptions due to AEs occurred in 60% of pts. Dose discontinuations occurred in 79% of pts, 57% due to disease progression or death, 21% due to AE. Dose limiting toxicities were observed at 10 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg. 40 mg QD was determined as the MTD. PK results showed generally dose-proportional increases in exposure. Tmax was at ~2 h; BGB-3245 had a long terminal half-life and 7.4-fold average accumulation in exposure at steady-state. 79% of pts were efficacy evaluable. The disease control rate was 48% with 1 CR, 5 cPR, 2 uPR and 8 SD&#8805;24 wks. Objective responders included BRAF V600E melanoma pts post-BRAF\/MEK and checkpoint inhibitors (2; 1 CR, 1 cPR), 1 NRAS G12S melanoma and 1 NRAS Q61K melanoma (post checkpoint inhibitors), 1 BRAF V600E LGSOC (progressed on BRAF inhibitor), 1 BRAF V600E cholangiocarcinoma (progressed on BRAF\/MEK inhibitors), 1 BRAF K601E\/PIK3CA endometrial cancer, and 1 KRAS G12D appendiceal cancer. Preliminary analysis of circulating tumor DNA showed correspondence to clinical response.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>BGB-3245 has a manageable safety profile and a generally dose-proportional PK. Antitumor activity was observed in pts with no approved targeted therapy options. The safety and early efficacy profile of BGB-3245 supports further investigation in selected MAPK-altered tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CT03-01 First-in-human phase I trials,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),Raf,Ras,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Alison M.

Exarafenib is a potentially best in class orally available pan-RAF inhibitor optimized for potency &#38; high selectivity. It has differentiated dose-dependent activity across a broad range of cell lines &#38; models driven by BRAF C I (inc. those with acquired resistance to 1<sup>st<\/sup> gen RAFi), C II, C III or NRAS alterations.<br \/>Methods: KN-8701 (NCT04913285) is an ongoing Phase 1 dose escalation &#38; dose expansion study at 35 sites in 7 countries evaluating exarafenib monotherapy in participants (pts) with advanced solid tumors harboring oncogenic BRAF or NRAS alterations.<br \/>Results: Preliminary results as of 13 Dec 2022 are reported for 52 pts (median age 63, 51.9% male) with a median of 3 prior therapies treated in 6 dose levels. Treated pts included those with solid tumors driven by BRAF C I (38.5%), C II (19.2%), C III (28.8%) alterations or melanoma pts with NRAS mutations (13.5%). Steady state exarafenib exposure (C<sub>max<\/sub> and AUC) increased dose proportionally. Pathway inhibition &#38; decreases in ctDNA were observed across BRAF classes &#38; tumor types. Dose limiting toxicities observed at the highest dose level were Grade 3 (Gr3) acneiform rash &#38; Gr3 macular rash. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined to be 300 mg bid. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) (any grade) occurred in 69.2% of pts with 13.5% of pts having Gr &#8805;3 events. Skin AEs (any grade) were the most common TRAEs observed in 48.1% of pts with 7.7% of pts having Gr &#8805; 3 skin events. GI TRAEs occurred in 19.2% pts (Gr 1-2 only), including diarrhea (1 pt, Gr 1). Reversible, asymptomatic Gr 3 increased ALT and\/or increased AST AEs in 3 pts were the only non-skin Gr &#8805; 3 TRAEs reported in &#8805; 2 pts. At therapeutically relevant exposures, there was no cutaneous evidence of paradoxical activation. Of the 34 pts across all dose levels with at least 1 post-baseline tumor assessment, 6 pts (17.6%) had a partial response (5 confirmed at submission date) &#38; 16 pts (47.1%) had stable disease including 8 pts (23.5%) with objective tumor shrinkage (up to 20%). The 6 responders all continue exarafenib therapy (treatment duration up to 12 months) and include 3 pts with BRAF C I alteration-driven cancers (inc. 1 RAFi + MEKi pre-treated melanoma pt) and 1 pt each with BRAF C II, BRAF C III-driven &#38; NRAS-mutation driven cancers. For pts who achieved or confirmed their best response at MTD, the response rate was 33% (4\/12) &#38; included responses in pts with BRAF C I, C II, C III, and NRAS mutant tumors.<br \/>Conclusions: Exarafenib achieves therapeutically meaningful drug exposures and demonstrates promising tolerability &#38; clinical activity in BRAF or NRAS alteration-driven solid tumors.

RAF dimer inhibitor lifirafenib (L) synergized with MEK inhibitor mirdametinib (M) in <i>RAS<\/i>-mutated cancer models. In this ongoing Phase 1b study of L+M in patients (pts) with advanced\/refractory solid tumors harboring MAPK pathway aberrations, we investigate preliminary safety, PK, and efficacy.<br \/>Methods: Pts were enrolled by a 3+3 design and treated with L (15-20 mg QD) + M (2-4 mg QD or BID) across 9 dose levels (DLs). Primary objectives were to evaluate safety\/tolerability, estimate MTD, and identify recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). Tumor responses were investigator assessed using RECIST v1.1. AEs were graded per NCI CTCAE v5.0.<br \/>Results: Table 1 presents demographic, efficacy, and safety results as of 01 Sep 2022. Objective responses (1 CR, 14 PRs) were achieved in 15\/54 (27.8%) efficacy-evaluable pts, including 10\/17 low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC) (58.8%; median exposure ~23 mo), 2 NSCLC (1 <i>NRAS<\/i> <i>Q61K<\/i>, 1 <i>BRAF-V600E<\/i>), 2 endometrial cancer (1 <i>BRAF ZC3HAv1<\/i> fusion, 1 <i>KRAS G12A<\/i>), and 1 LG serous adenocarcinoma of Mullerian origin (<i>KRAS G12V<\/i>). For L and M, plasma maximum drug concentration (C<sub>max<\/sub>) and exposure (AUC) were comparable to that of each compound at same DL in monotherapy studies, suggesting low likelihood of drug-drug interaction. L+M was generally well tolerated, with limited DLTs and discontinuations. There were 2 deaths due to TEAEs considered unrelated to L+M. The MTD\/RP2D were not yet determined.<br \/>Conclusions: L+M demonstrated a favorable safety profile and showed antitumor activity in pts with various <i>KRAS<\/i>, <i>NRAS<\/i>, and <i>BRAF<\/i> mutations across several solid tumor types, including LGSOC, NSCLC, and endometrial cancer. The combination warrants further clinical investigation.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{71038CCF-41E9-4AF7-B4BD-7582806767F1}\"><caption>Table 1<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Demographics (N=56)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Age (y), median (range)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">59.5 (29-78)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ECOG PS 0\/1, n (%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">56 (100.0)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Prior lines of therapy, median (range)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1 (1-6)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Efficacy Set (N=54), n (%)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">LGSOC (n=17)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Other than LGSOC (n=37)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">All malignancies (n=54)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ORR (CR+PR)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">10 (58.8)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5 (13.5)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">15 (27.8)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1 (5.9)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1 (1.9)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">PR<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">9 (52.9)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">5 (13.5)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">14 (25.9)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">SD<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6 (35.3)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">18 (48.6)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">24 (44.4)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">DCR (CR+PR+SD)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">16 (94.1)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">23 (62.2)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">39 (72.2)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>Safety Set (N=56), n (%)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TEAE<sup>a<\/sup><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">55 (98.2)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">SAE<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">23 (41.1)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Grade 3 TEAE<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">24 (42.9)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">3 (5.4)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">DLT<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">6 (10.7)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">CR, complete response; DCR, disease control rate; DLT, dose-limiting toxicity; ECOG PS, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status; LGSOC, low-grade serous ovarian cancer; ORR, objective response rate; PR, partial response; SAE, serious adverse event; SD, stable disease; TEAE, treatment-emergent adverse event. <sup>a<\/sup> Commonly reported (&#62;40%): fatigue (55.4%), dermatitis acneiform (46.4%), and diarrhea (44.6%).<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>(Acknowledgements: We thank patients\/their families, investigators, and site staff for participating in this study, which is sponsored by BeiGene.
