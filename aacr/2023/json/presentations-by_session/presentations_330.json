[{"Abstract":"Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is increasing in global prevalence and is divided into two types dependent on association with human papillomavirus (HPV), with a more favorable prognosis in HPV+ve tumors. Assay of HPV copy number in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) provides a minimally invasive method for detecting and monitoring tumor-derived HPV, with potential for enhancing clinical care. We have evaluated the utility of cfDNA droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) as a method for characterization and longitudinal monitoring of patients with OPSCC in a prospectively recruited cohort of 163 HPV+ve OPSCC patients. ddPCR assay of cfDNA for five HPV types showed overall 96.4% concordance with both p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and broad spectrum PCR analysis of solid tumor tissue. Longitudinal sampling in 105 HPV+ve patients, with median follow-up of 29 months, strongly predicted patient outcomes. Progression-free survival, stratified respectively by the presence or absence of detectable HPV cfDNA at a median of 13 weeks post-treatment, was 50% and 88% (p=0.001, hazard ratio 10.0 (95% CI 2.1-47.1)). In three patients sequential HPV measurement indicated cancer recurrence before the presence of clinical symptoms or detection on imaging. In two patients, greater reliance on sequential HPV measurement would have avoided surgical intervention which ultimately did not confirm disease presence. The high concordance of pre-treatment plasma cfDNA-HPV analysis with p16 IHC and HPV-PCR of solid tissue, together with the predictive value and utility of sequentially measured post-treatment cfDNA-HPV copy number, provide a compelling case for the routine use of cfDNA-HPV ddPCR in diagnostic classification and longitudinal monitoring of OPSCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"cfDNA,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Martyna Joanna Adamowicz<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lara  M.

While sequencing of genomic DNA from matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) can effectively identify CH variants, its wide application still remains prohibitively expensive. Computational-only solutions are challenging due to shared bioinformatic presentations in both CH and somatic variants such as low allele frequency. Development of such algorithm with clinically meaningful accuracy will have extensive utility in cancer care.<br \/><b> <\/b><b>Method<\/b><b> <\/b>We sequenced paired plasma-buffy coat samples from 754 pan-cancer patients using the FoundationOne&#174; Liquid CDx (F1LCDx) assay. The samples were randomized into a training and a test set. Ground truth (tumor somatic vs. CH) for SV, including base substitutions and short indels, was determined by comparing variant calls in plasma vs in PBMC. A deep learning prediction model was developed in the training set. The model incorporates genomic and clinical features as input and returns a CH prediction score, which was dichotomized by a learned threshold. After the threshold and model parameters were finalized, we applied the model to the test set to evaluate performance.<br \/><b> <\/b><b>Results<\/b> In the test set of 222 paired samples (523 CH and 904 tumor somatic variants), the model achieved 91% sensitivity (probability of predicting true CH variants as CH) and 88% specificity (probability of predicting true tumor somatic variants as tumor somatic). The model accurately identified CH variants in challenging genes such as <i>TP5<\/i>3 (sensitivity = 94%, specificity = 90%, n = 144) and <i>ATM<\/i> (sensitivity = 93%, specificity = 95%, n = 49), which that are known to harbor both tumor somatic and CH variants. Performance was further evaluated by cancer types and variant allele frequency. CH variants were identified with 90% sensitivity and 89% specificity in non-small cell lung carcinoma (n = 384), and with 87% sensitivity and 100% specificity in pancreas cancer (n = 53). CH variants were identified with 92% sensitivity and 87% specificity in 1%-5% variant allele frequency (n = 645), and with 94% sensitivity and 94% specificity in 5%-10% variant allele frequency (n = 189). Of note, a well-known oncogenic mutation in <i>ATM <\/i>was predicted as CH in a prostate cancer patient, which would prevent ineffective administration of PARP inhibitors. Multiple plasma specimens also gained more accurate bTMB and tumor fraction estimation by filtering out CH variants.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b><b> <\/b>For F1LCDx, we developed a computational method that distinguishes tumor somatic from CH variants from plasma cfDNA sequencing alone. The classifier exhibited high sensitivity and specificity in a pan-cancer cohort. Additional analytical validations are required in an external dataset. Clinical utility of this classifier will likely be further demonstrated in CH-corrected bTMB and tumor fraction.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Deep learning,Clonal Hematopoiesis,Cancer diagnostics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Daokun Sun<sup><\/sup>, Zheng Kuang<sup><\/sup>, Alexander  D.

The publicly available Infinium HumanMethylation450K BreadChip DNA methylation array indicates that these three markers are also highly methylated in gastric and esophageal cancer. In this study, we investigate the ability of the TriMeth assay to detect ctDNA in patients with gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinomas.<br \/>Methods: Purified DNA was extracted from tumor tissue and plasma from 63 patients with gastric\/GEJ adenocarcinomas. Sodium bisulfite conversion was performed to distinguish methylated from unmethylated cytosines. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) with methylation-specific primers and probes was performed to detect hypermethylated sites in the three genes<i> c9orf50<\/i>, <i>KCNQ5,<\/i> and <i>CLIP4.<\/i> The TriMeth assay was considered positive if at least two out of three markers were methylated according to a predefined cut-off. Eleven plasma samples from healthy individuals were used as negative controls.Results: In tumor tissue, methylated copies were detected in all 29 surgical samples (100% sensitivity), with varying allele frequencies. In plasma, methylated copies were detected in 14 out of 18 samples (78% sensitivity) from patients with advanced disease, with varying sensitivity amongst the three markers (AUC for the three markers <i>CLIP4<\/i>, <i>C9orf50,<\/i> and <i>KCNQ5<\/i> was 0.61, 0.86, and 0.94, respectively). In plasma from patients with resectable disease, methylated copies were detected in 10 of 17 samples (59% sensitivity), although only 7\/17 (41% sensitivity) were positive according to the predefined cut-off. All 11 controls were negative for methylation signals (100% specificity).<br \/>Conclusion and Further Perspectives: Using a pre-defined cut-off value, the TriMeth assay detected methylated DNA in all tumor samples. The sensitivity of the TriMeth assay in plasma was 78% in advanced disease and 41% in resectable disease. Further investigations of the TriMeth assay in patients with resectable gastric and GEJ adenocarcinomas are needed.

In this study we demonstrate a novel application of the RareCyte platform, which was developed to find and analyze rare CTCs from blood samples, in evaluating white blood cell (WBC) sub-populations for disease biomarkers.<br \/><i>Experimental Procedures: <\/i>Using AccuCyte&#174;, an unbiased density-based method for collecting nucleated cells from whole blood, we transferred the nucleated cells to slides and stained for CD14, CD66b, and CK\/EpCAM to identify monocytes (CD14+\/CD66b-), granulocytes (CD14-\/CD66b+), and CTCs (CK\/EpCAM+), as well as a drug-target biomarker to evaluate its expression across all cells. These slides were then imaged with CyteFinder&#174;, an automated multiparameter immunofluorescent (IF) microscopy system that applies machine learning algorithms for cell identification. Each slide contains millions of cells, so we developed novel scanning and analysis algorithms to quantify WBC sub-populations in addition to rare CTCs.<br \/><i>Results: <\/i>In addition to detection and enumeration of CTCs, the RareCyte system was able to detect individual white blood cells and quantify monocyte and granulocyte subpopulations. Our results correlated very well with standard CBC (Complete Blood Count) readings from multiple donors. Additionally, the monocyte and granulocyte populations were evaluated for expression of a drug-target biomarker. While expression was observed on both granulocytes and monocytes, monocytes had a significantly higher expression of the drug-target biomarker, a critical finding for future implementation of this drug.<br \/><i>Conclusions: <\/i>Our results show that through modifications to the RareCyte platform we can identify rare and non-rare cell populations simultaneously and evaluate expression of biomarkers and drug-targets across multiple cells of interest. This new application combines the benefits of high throughput data analysis of flow cytometry with the specificity and sensitivity of rare cell detection. Additionally, high-resolution multiplexed immunofluorescent imaging provides cell morphology and biomarker localization information. Our ability to add multiple biomarkers in conjunction with CTC and other rare cell detection provides multiple avenues for future research. One possible application is characterizing white blood cells that cluster with CTCs, which are known to portend a worse prognosis for patients. Our modified workflow could be implemented to precisely characterize these WBCs that contribute to the metastatic process.

A total of 15 patients and 40 samples were enrolled (Stage I: II: III: IV: recurrence=1:1:3:4:6). The average number of CTCs was 3.1 cells\/ml (0-6.3 cells). Among the 15 patients with GC, CTCs were detected by our system in 13 patients. Even in GC patients suspected with peritoneal dissemination without definitive mass by imaging, CTCs were successfully detected. For the patients who were measured multiple times with clinical time course, we found a close correlation between CTC number and CEA level or image assessment.<br \/>Conclusion: We successfully detected CTCs in the patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer patients.

This systematic review summarized current data on the utility of ctDNA in lung cancer clinical research and practice and provides insights for integrating ctDNA into drug development and patient care.<br \/>Methods: The Embase database was used to identify clinical research articles of ctDNA in lung cancer from 2015 to 2020. ctDNA clinical utilities were reviewed and summarized into 3 areas: early diagnosis, prognostication, and monitoring disease progression\/treatment response. Associations of ctDNA with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated in the embedded meta-analysis. Pooled estimates were calculated using fixed-effect or random-effect models depending on study heterogeneity.<br \/>Results: After screening and review, 111 studies were included. ctDNA testing has been increasing in recent years, with 54.1% of the selected studies published in 2019 or 2020. 73.0% of the studies were conducted in patients with advanced\/metastatic disease; 79.3% included patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ctDNA was used mainly for prognostication (76.6%), demonstrating that the presence of ctDNA is associated with poor prognosis. In the meta-analyses, overall ctDNA detection\/positivity was associated with shorter PFS (n=622; HR=2.34; 95% CI, 1.90-2.89) and OS (n=723; HR=2.33; 95% CI, 1.91-2.85). Studies focused specifically on <i>EGFR<\/i> mutations in ctDNA reported similar prognostication results. Heterogeneity by stage, histological type, and ctDNA measurement timing were evaluated and showed no significant impact on these pooled estimates. ctDNA clearance\/decrease during treatment was associated with a lower risk of progression (n=552; HR=0.24; 95% CI, 0.19-0.31) and death (n=669; HR=0.40; 95% CI, 0.27-0.60). Few studies evaluated the utility of ctDNA in lung cancer for diagnosis or monitoring tumor progression across the treatment spectrum.<br \/>Conclusions: Recent studies demonstrated the clinical value of ctDNA in lung cancer prognostication\/monitoring, primarily in advanced NSCLC. Large, multicenter clinical trials and real-world longitudinal data sets are needed to validate these findings, and prospective trials are required to address challenges related to integrating ctDNA testing into clinical practice.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer,Liquid biopsies,Circulating tumor DNA,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Solange Peters<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Page Abrahamson<sup>2<\/sup>, Nicholas Ballew<sup>3<\/sup>, Linda Kalilani<sup>4<\/sup>, Kelesitse Phiri<sup>5<\/sup>, Kelly Bell<sup>3<\/sup>, Alexander Slowley<sup>6<\/sup>, Maglalena Zajac<sup>6<\/sup>, Erin Hofstatter<sup>7<\/sup>, Alexander Stojadinovic<sup>8<\/sup>, Angela Silvestro<sup>7<\/sup>, Zebin Wang<sup>9<\/sup>, Amine Aziez<sup>10<\/sup>, Xuezheng Sun<sup>11<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Lusanne University, Lusanne, Switzerland,<sup>2<\/sup>Salmon Bay Consulting, Seattle, WA,<sup>3<\/sup>GSK, Philadelphia, PA,<sup>4<\/sup>GSK, Raleigh, NC,<sup>5<\/sup>GSK, Collegeville, PA,<sup>6<\/sup>GSK, London, United Kingdom,<sup>7<\/sup>GSK, Waltham, MA,<sup>8<\/sup>GSK (at the time the analysis was conducted), Collegeville, PA,<sup>9<\/sup>GSK (at the time the analysis was conducted), Waltham, MA,<sup>10<\/sup>GSK, Zug, Switzerland,<sup>11<\/sup>GSK, Chapel Hill, NC","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6b85e521-ac5d-495b-85bd-46e4b559e911","ControlNumber":"2325","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

However clinical applications of CTCs in urothelial carcinomas (UC) remain limited. There is a need for sensitive and disease-specific CTC assay for urothelial cancer. As CTCs are very rare in blood compared to blood cells and may vary due to tumor heterogeneity, detection and isolation of them solely based on one biomarker (e.g., EpCAM) would be insufficient. To achieve better results and increase clinical relevance, we designed a CTC capture device that was functionalized with multiple antibodies specific to UC.<br \/>Methods: We engineered a novel UC-CTC capture device using nanotechnology and biomimetic cell rolling. To capture UC cells, we examined 4 biomarkers: EpCAM, Nectin-4, Trop-2, and FGFR3, that are highly expressed in UC. We engineered CTC assays using single and multi-biomarker capture surfaces. The capture sensitivity and selectivity of the device were investigated using four bladder cancer cell lines as well as a leukocyte model, HL-60, as negative control. CTCs are defined as CK+\/DAPI+\/CD45- cells. The capture sensitivity was compared between the different surfaces with each of the different antibodies and the final UC-CTC chip with optimized antibody mix was chosen to detect CTCs from UC patients.<br \/>Results: We examined the CTC capture using 4 UC cell lines: UM-UC-1, T-24, HT1376, RT4. The devices that utilized single antibodies were much less sensitive (capture efficiencies less than 82%). In comparison, combination antibody capture improved sensitivity to &#62;90%. Negative control using the HL-60 cells showed minimal non-specific binding, &#60;0.3%. We were also able to validate the CTC assay using patient samples and demonstrated high sensitivity. For example, we captured ~302 CTCs\/mL in a patient who had early-stage T2 muscle invasive UC.<br \/>Conclusion: We developed a novel CTC capture device using four UC-specific capture antibodies for the detection and isolation of CTCs in UC. Compared to the configuration of EpCAM alone, the mixture of multiple antibodies improved the capture efficiency up to 1.4-fold for <i>in vitro<\/i> bladder cancer cell spiking assays. High specificity was also achieved, with low levels of non-specific leukocyte detection. High sensitivity and specificity suggest that this platform has potential impact to detect CTCs from patients with UC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Liquid biopsies,Bladder cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Qinhan Zhou<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Poellmann<sup>2<\/sup>, Nikhila Reddy Sultanpuram<sup>3<\/sup>, Damla Gunenc<sup>1<\/sup>, Krista English<sup>1<\/sup>, Luke Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Runze Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, Seungpyo Hong<sup>2<\/sup>, Andrew Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Tian Zhang<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI,<sup>3<\/sup>Radiation Oncology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"618e71f5-a621-41c1-80de-52021ba1b70f","ControlNumber":"2829","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Q.

Here, we analyzed melanoma patients receiving ICI over several years using a novel tumor-informed ctDNA platform, and correlated the findings to clinical outcome.<br \/>Methods: Plasma from 23 advanced melanoma patients was collected at ICI treatment cycles for up to 1,200 days and retrospectively profiled using NeXT Personal&#8482; in this research study. NeXT Personal is a tumor-informed liquid biopsy assay that leverages whole-genome sequencing of tumor\/normal samples to generate a personalized liquid biopsy panel for each patient consisting of up to 1,800 selected variants to enable ultra-sensitive molecular residual disease (MRD) detection down to 1-3 parts per million (PPM). Each bespoke panel also covers a fixed set of &#62;2,100 known clinical and resistance loci for detecting variants emerging under therapeutic pressure. We compared NeXT Personal results with imaging and RECIST assessments for each patient.<br \/>Results: Results showed ultra-high sensitivity for ctDNA with a wide dynamic range of detections from approximately 100,000 PPM down to 2.3 PPM. The median limit of detection was 1.97 PPM. Excluding patients with recent second-line therapy, 94% (17\/18) of baseline samples were ctDNA positive (ctDNA+), including all patients who progressed. 37% (22\/59) of on-treatment ctDNA+ detections were &#60;100 PPM. 100% of ctDNA+ detections had correlated imaging findings via RECIST confirming presence of tumor, including the lowest PPM detections. Similarly, 100% of complete responses (CR) assessed via RECIST were ctDNA negative for all corresponding plasma timepoints. ctDNA clearance preceded imaging derived CR by an average of 81 days (clearance = 131 days, CR = 212 days). Patients that attained ctDNA clearance at one or more plasma timepoints had significantly longer overall survival (OS) (log-rank test; p = 0.007). Patients with increasing ctDNA levels over the first 25 (or 50) days compared to baseline had significantly reduced OS (p &#60; 0.05). Analysis of the fixed clinical portion of each bespoke panel showed dynamic variant allele frequency changes in 21 variants including therapeutic targets such as BRAF V600E.<br \/>Conclusions: Advanced melanoma patients exhibit a wide range of ctDNA concentrations at the beginning and during the course of treatment. Ultra-sensitive ctDNA detection down to 2.3 PPM was achieved using the NeXT Personal platform. Most importantly, our pilot study indicates that ctDNA measurements correlated with clinical outcome. The de novo detection of emerging clinically actionable and resistance variants using NeXT Personal can potentially be used to inform treatment once validated in future studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Immune checkpoint blockade,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Laura Keller<sup>1<\/sup>, Isabel Heidrich<sup>2<\/sup>, Julian Kött<sup>2<\/sup>, Charles W.

Non-tumor informed, plasma-only ctDNA assays are an accessible and rapid mechanism to assess ctDNA levels in patients undergoing treatment for lung cancer but may be impacted by clonal hematopoietic (CH) mutations misclassified as tumor derived. Here, we assess the impact of CH on MR measurement in patients receiving durvalumab, with or without tremelimumab, versus chemotherapy in the Phase III MYSTIC trial.<br \/>Methods: Using a non-tumor informed, mutation based, ctDNA assay that assesses 500-genes (Guardant Health [GH] Omni, subset to the GH360 genomic coordinates [74-genes] for additional analyses) we calculated plasma-only molecular response (MR) based on change in ctDNA levels between baseline and a 4 or 6-week on-treatment timepoint in 713 patients. FoundationOne CDx tissue data subset to GH Omni genomic coordinates enabled <i>&#8220;in-silico&#8221;<\/i> tumor-informed MR analysis where only mutations detectable in tumor tissue were followed as response indicators, in 273 of 713 patients. Targeted duplex-sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA was performed to assess the presence of CH mutations misclassified as tumor derived through plasma-only analyses.<br \/>Results: Plasma-only MR assessment associated with survival outcomes in immunotherapy treatment arms but not the chemotherapy arm; tumor shrinkage on imaging at 6-week radiological evaluation also predicted survival outcomes only in the immunotherapy arms, suggesting that early tumor response is a stronger predictor of outcome for patients treated with immunotherapy. <i>In-silico<\/i> tumor-informed MR analyses led to an improved association between MR and outcome across all treatment arms and an increased rate in observed ctDNA clearance. Early tumor-informed ctDNA clearance strongly indicated survival benefit in patients receiving durvalumab and tremelimumab. Targeted analyses of mutations categorized as tumor derived in plasma-only analyses, but absent from tumor tissue sequencing analyses in the same patient, revealed that 87\/154 (57%) were PBMC-derived highlighting CH as capable of confounding plasma-only analyses.<br \/>Conclusion:<b> <\/b>These exploratory analyses from a phase III randomized study support early-ctDNA kinetics as predictive of long-term benefit in metastatic NSCLC patients and support technical optimization of CH-subtraction approaches to maximize utility of ctDNA as a response biomarker in patients with NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,Immunotherapy,Durvalumab,Tremelimumab,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chris Abbosh<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Kuziora<sup>2<\/sup>, Daniel Stetson<sup>3<\/sup>, Zhongwu Lai<sup>3<\/sup>, Yashaswi Shrestha<sup>2<\/sup>, Paul Labrousse<sup>3<\/sup>, Xiaojin Shi<sup>2<\/sup>, Helen Mann<sup>1<\/sup>, Diana Merino Vega<sup>2<\/sup>, Matthew  D.

The transcription factor, achaete-scute homolog 1 (ASCL1), regulates neuronal and NE cell development, and is a hallmark of the ASCL1<sup>(+)<\/sup> SCLC subtype. Further, investigating subtype has become increasingly important as new drug candidates emerge for SCLC that may be efficacious in only some patients. ASCL1 by IHC tissue biopsy is highly specific, detecting patients who have transformed from NSCLC to SCLC and have acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in NSCLC. Quantification of ASCL1 on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is a blood-based, non-invasive alternative to tissue biopsy that provides functional protein-level expression data to monitor lung cancer patients across the disease continuum, informing patient treatment.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> A 4-color immunofluorescence (IF) assay was developed to detect ASCL1 expression in CTCs from routine blood samples, comprising detection of nucleated cells (DAPI), cytokeratin positive CTCs, CD45<sup>(+)<\/sup> white blood cells (WBC), and ASCL1<sup>(+)<\/sup> cells. During validation, cancer cell lines (SHP-77 [ASCL<sup>(+)<\/sup>] and U2-OS [ASCL1<sup>(-)<\/sup>]) were spiked into normal blood at a ratio of 1:10,000 (CLC\/WBC) and plated onto coated glass slides. Slides were stained, imaged, and CTC candidates were identified with a proprietary imaging algorithm. The threshold of ASCL1 positivity (316 MFI) included 99% of all ASCL1<sup>(-)<\/sup>, U2-OS cells. Assay specificity, sensitivity, overall accuracy, and subcellular localization of biomarker expression were assessed. The ability of the assay to quantify ASCL1 expression in CTCs was confirmed using 31 samples from 11 Extensive Stage SCLC patients.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: The ASCL1 CTC assay achieved an overall accuracy of 0.992 (95% CI 0.081, 0.993), and an analytical specificity and sensitivity of 0.990 and 0.995, respectively. The assay displayed a positive predictive value and a negative predictive value of 0.979 and 0.998, respectively, determined by evaluating ASCL1 expression in SHP-77 (N=4062) and U2-OS (N=8645).

While circulating cells expressing both epithelial and leukocyte markers (double-positive cells, DPs) have also been reported in cancer patients, they are typically excluded from further characterization per this classical definition. The leading hypothesis for the presence of DPs is heterotypical cell fusion between tumor cells and macrophages. However, there is insufficient evidence to exclude alternative biological origins or to demonstrate that patient DPs indeed contain tumor-derived genomes. Here, we examined the clonality and copy number status of DPs together with CTCs from a metastatic breast cancer (MBC) case.<br \/>Methods: Two blood samples from an ER+\/HER2- MBC patient collected prior to and after three weeks of endocrine-based therapy were analyzed. Cells were plated onto glass slides and stained with immunofluorescence antibodies to identify CTCs (DAPI+, CK+, CD45-) and DPs (DAPI+, CK+, CD45+) using a published, enrichment-free detection workflow. Individual cells were then isolated via micro-manipulation and subjected to low-pass whole-genome sequencing for single-cell copy number profiling.<br \/>Results: Over 3000 CK+ cells were detected per slide analyzed (&#62;6920\/mL blood) and approximately 80% were CD45+ (DPs). Copy number profiling of 40 CK+ cells and 3 white blood cell (WBC) controls revealed clonal alterations that were shared across CTCs and DPs, but not WBCs. These included gains and losses on chromosome (chr) 1, loss on chr 4q, a &#8220;firestorm&#8221;-like signature on chr 8, chr 16p gain, and chr 16q loss. Alteration amplitudes were also consistent between CTCs and DPs, with no indication of amplitude dampening in DPs. Loss of chr X was observed in a subclone of CK+ cells, including 8\/18 CTCs and 4\/22 DPs. Copy number gain of the PTPRC gene, which encodes for the CD45 protein, was observed across 38\/40 CK+ cells and was not associated with CD45 expression. No other CNAs were unique to CTCs or DPs.<br \/>Conclusions: This is the first direct comparison of DP and CTC copy number profiles from the same patient. We show that DPs share clonal CNAs with CTCs, confirming their tumor lineage. Importantly, DP CNA amplitudes did not exhibit dampening, which would be expected if non-tumor DNA was present, and DP profiles did not contain additional CNAs, which often result when hybrid cells undergo division or ploidy reduction. Ongoing work is focused on proteomic characterization to examine expression of additional leukocyte markers. However, these preliminary results were not consistent with the hypothesis of DPs as tumor-immune cell hybrids and highlights the need for further studies to understand their biological and clinical significance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Liquid biopsies,Copy number alterations,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nikki Higa<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Audrey Limb<sup>1<\/sup>, Andrés Rivera<sup>1<\/sup>, Anand Kolatkar<sup>1<\/sup>, Sara Sakura<sup>2<\/sup>, Julie Joseph<sup>2<\/sup>, Margaret Kildee<sup>2<\/sup>, Lynne Mullican<sup>2<\/sup>, Craig  D.

Epigenetic changes may appear at very early stages before diagnosis. Thus, they could be used as epigenetic biomarkers for early detection or risk of cancer development. Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) profiling has emerged as a promising biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Herein, we developed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) based assays for assessing multiple DNA methylated and mutated regions in both low-quantity (plasma cfDNA) and low-quality formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue for colorectal cancer (CRC) detection.<br \/>Methods: For the OptiSeq<sup>TM<\/sup> CRC methylation panel, we assessed the methylation status of CpG dinucleotides in 42 genes. With this panel, we profiled 6 CRC samples (matching cfDNA and FFPE), 2 primary colon tumors with adjacent normal, and 6 advanced adenomas (AA) FFPE tissue DNA. For healthy individuals, we profiled 12 normal colon FFPE samples and 31 plasma cfDNA (26 matching buffy coat DNA samples). For the OptiSeq<sup>TM<\/sup> CRC mutation panel, the mutation status was assessed in 43 genes. Here, we profiled 6 CRC samples (matching cfDNA and FFPE), 19 CRC plasma cfDNA, 4 AA FFPE and 42 healthy individuals&#8217; plasma cfDNA (26 matching buffy coat DNA samples). The analytical and clinical performance for both panels (separately and combined) were calculated using advanced adenoma (AA), CRC, and cancer-free individuals.<br \/>Results: For CRC cfDNA samples, clinical samples testing showed that the methylation panel had a sensitivity of 50% (95% CI: 13.9-86.0) and specificity of 100% (95% CI: 86.2-100) while the mutation panel yielded the sensitivity 88% (95% CI: 67.7-96.8) and specificity 100% (95% CI: 89.5-100). Combining the mutation panel with the methylation panel, the sensitivity increased to 100% (95% CI: 51.6-100) and specificity to 100% (95% CI: 65.1-93.3). For AA FFPE samples, the methylation panel analysis yielded a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 39.5-100.0) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI: 67.8-100).<br \/>Conclusion: We have developed and validated the targeted NGS-based panels to detect clinically relevant mutation and methylation patterns and demonstrate its potential as a highly sensitive assay for early CRC diagnosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Colorectal cancer,Diagnosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Pushpinder Bains<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Mikhail Kulak<sup><\/sup>, Zhen Cui<sup><\/sup>, Alisha Babu<sup><\/sup>, Stella Tran<sup><\/sup>, Bongyong Lee<sup><\/sup>, Aiguo Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Michael Sha<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>DiaCarta, Inc., Pleasanton, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a69799a9-ee17-4643-9f55-8c5be43f2262","ControlNumber":"2464","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

Nevertheless, durable responses to PARPi remain elusive and primary resistance is an additional major challenge. As a result, dissecting therapeutic vulnerabilities in HR-aberrant patients is crucial and may reveal novel PARPi-based combinations for evaluation in future clinical trials.In this multi-institutional study, we used the CLIA-certified PredicineCARE&#8482; cell-free DNA (cfDNA) assay that assesses 152 genes to profile plasma from 375 mCRPC patients from Australia and the USA. Reportable alterations included pathogenic single-nucleotide (somatic and germline) and copy number variants. Association between alterations and clinical outcomes were assessed using log rank, cox proportional, and chi-squared analyses.Overall, 65 patients (17%) had evidence of a pathogenic <i>BRCA2 <\/i>aberration, which were commonly hemizygous (78% vs 22% homozygous deletions), monoallelic (70% vs 30% bi-allelic), somatic (87% vs 13% germline), and clonal (83% vs 17% subclonal) in nature. There was no significant difference in plasma tumour fraction in patients with single vs two-copy loss of <i>BRCA2, <\/i>and <i>BRCA2 <\/i>zygosity did not have differing effects on outcomes, with both being similarly associated with shorter overall survival (HR 0.48, <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.002, and HR 0.45, <i>p<\/i>=0.003, respectively). Pathogenic <i>BRCA1<\/i> aberrations were present in 10 patients (3%). PSA response rates to androgen-receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPI) were significantly lower in patients with a <i>BRCA1<\/i> and\/or a <i>BRCA2<\/i> aberration (32% vs 60%, <i>p<\/i>=0.02), and we observed this BRCA-defective subgroup to be enriched for <i>AR<\/i> aberrations (71% had &#62;1 <i>AR<\/i> aberration vs 38% in BRCA-intact patients, <i>p<\/i>=0.001). BRCA-defective cancers were also significantly enriched for aberrations in key neuroendocrine markers <i>TP53<\/i> (62% vs 28%)<i>, RB1<\/i> (60% vs 17%)<i>, <\/i>and <i>MYC <\/i>(27% vs 9%), as well as for PI3K pathway aberrations (<i>PTEN <\/i>63% vs 25% and <i>PIK3CA<\/i> 37% vs 14%). In summary, we show that BRCA alterations are associated with worse prognosis in mCRPC and reduced benefit from ARPI, and that the prognostic and predictive utility of cfDNA-detected <i>BRCA2<\/i> may be independent of zygosity state, potentially due to constraints with copy number loss identification in samples with low tumour DNA. Additionally, on top of a high proportion of <i>AR<\/i> alterations, BRCA-defective cancers were also enriched in a number of potentially actionable targets and neuroendocrine markers. Clinical trials that leverage rational co-targeting strategies will provide an opportunity to enhance the efficacy of PARPi in mCRPC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,BRCA,Cell-free DNA,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Heidi Fettke<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chao Dai<sup>2<\/sup>, Edmond  M.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by tumor cells are abundant in the plasma of cancer patients, but their potential as a source of tumor material for multi-omic profiling remains widely unexplored.<br \/>Design: We present a comprehensive analysis of plasma-derived tumor EV-DNA and EV-RNA by next-generation sequencing (NGS), in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). First, we used a range of <i>in vitro<\/i> (PC3, LnCap, 22Rv1 and C4-2) and <i>in vivo<\/i> models, including patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDXs), to optimize genomic and transcriptomic analysis of DNA and RNA contained in tumoral EVs. Next, we validated our findings in a cohort of 35 mCRPC patients with longitudinal plasma samples (n=92) collected before, 4-weeks after treatment and at progression to androgen receptor signaling inhibitor (ARSI) therapy. Tumor copy number alterations (CNAs) obtained by low-pass whole genome sequencing (lpWGS) were used to infer tumor fraction (TF). In addition, transcriptomic signatures were obtained from EV-RNA sequencing.<br \/>Results: We demonstrate that circulating EV-DNA copy-number (CN) profiling matches tumor CN profiles in same-patient mCRPC biopsies (r: 0.47-0.85, p&#60;0.001) and ctDNA, confirming its tumoral origin. EV-DNA tumor fraction (TF) was prognostic, identifying patients with shorter time to progression (HR 2.29, p=0.04). In addition, we developed a novel approach for the analysis of mRNA Expression in Circulating EVs (RExCuE), showing high correlation between EV-RNA and tumor biopsy RNA <i>in vivo<\/i> and in patient samples for the whole transcriptome, tumor-associated transcripts and the Hallmark androgen response gene set (all r&#62;0.70, p&#60;0.001). EV-RNAseq was able to detect and monitor transcriptomic signatures of response and resistance to ARSI in clinical samples as early as after 4 weeks of therapy. Last, we derived a specific signature of ARSI response in EV-RNA <i>in vivo<\/i> that predicts patient response to therapy.<br \/>Conclusion: Our work represents the first evidence for circulating EVs as a biomarker to monitor evolution of tumor genomics and transcriptomics in mCRPC on therapy, allowing the study of drug response and resistance mechanisms and with a unique potential to be developed as clinical biomarker.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular vesicles,Liquid biopsies,Prostate cancer,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Irene Casanova-Salas<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sarai Córdoba-Terreros<sup>1<\/sup>, Daniel Aguilar<sup>1<\/sup>, Laura Agúndez<sup>1<\/sup>, Julián Brandariz<sup>1<\/sup>, Nicolás Herranz<sup>1<\/sup>, Alexandre Sierra<sup>1<\/sup>, Pablo Cresta<sup>1<\/sup>, Maria del Mar Suanes<sup>1<\/sup>, Mario Soriano<sup>2<\/sup>, Elena Castellano<sup>3<\/sup>, Javier Hernández-Losa<sup>4<\/sup>, Héctor Peinado<sup>3<\/sup>, Joan Carles<sup>1<\/sup>, Joaquin Mateo<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>VHIO Vall D'Hebron Institute of Oncology, Barcelona, Spain,<sup>2<\/sup>CIPF Principe Felipe Research Institute, Valencia, Spain,<sup>3<\/sup>CNIO Spanish National Cancer Research Centre, Madrid, Spain,<sup>4<\/sup>Vall D'Hebron Hospital, Barcelona, Spain","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"eb1cdf9a-72a3-42d7-be2f-9e0e6f3005d2","ControlNumber":"3498","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>I.

Patients had stage II or III rectal adenocarcinoma and received NAT including chemoradiation and chemotherapy. Patients without a clinical complete response (cCR) underwent surgical resection, while patients with a cCR were enrolled in a watch-and-wait protocol for organ preservation. Complete response (CR) after NAT was defined as either pathological complete response or a cCR sustained for &#8805;2&#8201;years. Disease-free survival (DFS) was measured from the start of NAT. Median follow-up was 5.41 years [range 2.96-8.38]. ctDNA analyses were performed using the C2i Genomics platform. A patient-specific molecular profile was created by performing whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of their tumor and matched normal DNA (40x coverage). WGS (20x coverage) was performed on plasma samples collected at baseline (before NAT), interval evaluation (halfway through NAT), re-staging evaluation (8 weeks after NAT) and follow-up (3-6 months after NAT).<br \/><b>Results. <\/b>Tumor was detected in plasma samples from 24\/25 patients at baseline (96% sensitivity). The tumor fraction (TF) levels detected at baseline separated responders from non-responders (median TF 6.2e-4 vs 1.4e-3; p=0.055). Tumor detection at interval was associated with a lower rate of CR (25% vs. 75%, p=0.0095) and shorter time to recurrence (58.3% vs. 94.1% 3-year DFS, p=0.02). Tumor detection at follow-up was associated with a higher rate of recurrence (p=0.037) and tumor was detected at follow-up for all 5\/5 patients who developed recurrence. Overall TF dynamics showed clearance of ctDNA down to the non-detection level throughout treatment in patients with a CR, while non-responders exhibited non-decreasing and often increasing estimates of ctDNA burden. Analysis of tissue WGS data identified multiple patients with colibactin associated mutational signatures, which provides additional insights into their cancer etiology.<br \/><b>Conclusions. <\/b>The WGS-based approach for ctDNA analysis exhibited very high sensitivity for detection at baseline. TF across multiple time points separated responders from non-responders, suggesting potential value as a prognostic marker. Detection of ctDNA at follow-up for all patients who recurred is indicative of potential clinical utility for treatment de-escalation in the context of organ preservation strategies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Circulating tumor DNA,ctDNA,Whole genome sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Francisco Sanchez-Vega<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chin-Tung Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Danielle Afterman<sup>2<\/sup>, Dana Omer<sup>1<\/sup>, Madison Darmofal<sup>1<\/sup>, Ino de Bruijn<sup>1<\/sup>, Walid  K.

Low ctDNA levels immediately after surgery necessitate extremely sensitive detection methods. Additionally, for potential clinical implementation, detection methods should ideally feature short turnaround times (TATs) and low analysis costs. Compared to sequencing-based detection methods, digital PCR is low-cost, and features TATs of less than a day. Consequently, digital PCR is a good candidate for clinical implementation. Here, we present ctDNA detection results from a highly optimized, tumor-informed digital PCR strategy in a large cohort of stage II-III colorectal cancer (CRC) patients.<br \/>Methods: Stage II-III CRC patients (n=864) treated with curative intent were recruited from Danish surgical centers from 2014 to 2021. Whole exome sequencing was conducted on matched tumor and buffy coat from all patients. After thorough clonality assessment, a mutational target was chosen for digital PCR analysis. Plasma samples (8mL) collected before and within 60 days after surgery, were investigated for ctDNA using digital PCR. Additionally, a subset of patients (n=229) had serial samples collected every three months analyzed for ctDNA.<br \/>Results: Before surgery, ctDNA was detected in 569\/828 (69%) analyzed blood samples. A minimum of 12 months of radiological follow-up was available for 598\/864 patients at time of writing, enabling prognostic evaluation of ctDNA detection in these patients. Postoperative ctDNA detection was highly correlated to future recurrence (HR=9.6, 95%CI 6.3-15, P&#60;0.001). The median time to recurrence was significantly shorter for postoperatively ctDNA positive patients (10 months, interquartile range (IQR) 3.8-12 months) compared to ctDNA negative patients (18 months, IQR 12-26 months, P&#60;0.001), indicating a higher disease burden postoperatively in ctDNA positive patients. In a subset of patients with samples collected immediately after adjuvant treatment (n=95) and serially (n=186), ctDNA was also prognostic of recurrence (HR=6.4, CI95% 2.9-14, P&#60;0.001; HR=27, 95%CI 14-52, P&#60;0.001). A minimum of 12 months of follow-up is expected to be available for 700 patients before the AACR meeting 2023.<br \/>Conclusion: These results from one of the largest ctDNA detection cohorts of stage II-III CRC patients demonstrate that our personalized digital PCR approach effectively detects MRD immediately after surgery. Additionally, our approach shows promise for serial ctDNA detection for recurrence surveillance applications. With digital PCR being a widespread and cost-effective method with low TATs, clinical implementation of ctDNA analysis may be more forthright using this method over cost-intensive sequencing-based methods.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,Biomarkers,Liquid biopsies,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tenna  V.

In prostate cancer (PC), differences in DNA methylation regions have been observed between normal and tumor cells. However, acquiring the samples to study these patterns can be challenging through standard biopsies. Therefore, liquid biopsies provide a minimally invasive method which can be utilized to investigate the methylome of PC patients. In this study, we used liquid biopsies from a well-defined group of PC patients to examine cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation signatures and determine their clinical significance in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Plasma was prospectively collected from a cohort 108 PC patients representing localized PC (n=24), metastatic hormone-sensitive PC (mHSPC) (n=28), and metastatic castration resistant PC (mCRPC) (n=37 pre-, n=19 post- mCRPC treatments). cfDNA from the patient plasma was used for an enzymatic methylation sequencing (EM-seq) that targeted a panel of genes (n=441) implicated in prostate cancer biology. Methylation status at CpG islands of these genes were examined using Twist targeted cfDNA methylation assay. The Bismark program was used for methylation calling. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) across various patient outcomes were assessed by linking the CpG methylation data from target genes to the associated clinical data.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We identified DMRs in 305 out of the 411 target genes in the plasma epigenome when comparing the mCRPC to non-mCRPC states (localized PC and mHSPC) (false discovery rate, FDR &#60; 0.2). From these 305 genes, we found that in patients experiencing only PSA relapse after failure of mHSPC (biochemical mCRPC) versus patients with clinical progression (clinical mCRPC), 261 out of the 305 genes had DMRs (p &#60;0.05). We also compared DMRs before and after 3-months of treatment in the mCRPC state and found that 175 out of the 305 genes showed significant changes after 3-months of mCRPC-specific treatment. Furthermore, from these 175 genes, 24 genes showed significant methylation differences when comparing patients with and without disease progression during mCRPC treatment and 20 genes showed significant differences when comparing patients with neuroendocrine features to those with common adenocarcinoma of PC at the mCRPC state (p&#60;0.05). These differentially methylated genes include <i>RUNX3, FOXA2, HIC1<\/i> and <i>MYCN<\/i>.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> cfDNA-based liquid biopsies provide a minimally invasive method to investigate the methylome of mCRPC patients. Our observations that cfDNA methylation was correlated with disease progression provide evidence that DMRs across a select panel of genes may serve as predictive biomarker for poor response to therapy and survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA methylation,Liquid biopsies,Biomarkers,Prostate cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jodie Wong<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yijun Tian<sup>2<\/sup>, Amir Bitaraf<sup>1<\/sup>, Claire Hanson<sup>3<\/sup>, Matthew Larson<sup>3<\/sup>, Jennifer Lloyd<sup>3<\/sup>, Julia Batten<sup>3<\/sup>, Neeraj Agarwal<sup>3<\/sup>, Umang Swami<sup>3<\/sup>, Anna Neibling<sup>3<\/sup>, Jonathan Tward<sup>3<\/sup>, Benjamin Maughan<sup>3<\/sup>, Sumati Gupta<sup>3<\/sup>, Manish Kohli<sup>3<\/sup>, Liang Wang<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>H.

As more targeted and immune therapies enter the market, selecting the optimal drug target could improve patient outcomes drastically. One way to achieve this goal is to generate multi-omic datasets from the cancer cells in circulation, known as circulating tumor cells (CTCs). In this study, Astrin Biosciences&#8217; patented isolation technology was used to enrich CTCs with high purity from the blood of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients. The enriched CTCs and a patient matched control sample consisting primarily of white blood cells were divided such that RNA and protein could be interrogated from the same patient. Label free unbiased mass spectrometry was used to identify proteins and marks the first time a global proteomic assessment has been performed in CTCs from cancer patients. Initial analysis identified over 1,500 peptides corresponding to greater than 500 proteins with increased epithelial cell markers in the CTC-enriched sample and increased WBC markers in the control sample. Hallmarks of androgen response and detection of the androgen receptor were also identified in the CTC proteome. In addition to the proteome, RNA sequencing will also be performed to generate a multi-omic platform to detect cancer signaling mechanisms and biomarkers. Overall, this study was designed to show the feasibility of obtaining multi-omic data from a liquid biopsy and future studies will provide more insight into the clinical utility of such data. As we analyze more patients, we plan to compare the protein and RNA signatures across mCRPC patients and eventually be able to map patient outcomes and correlate them with drug response with the overall goal to improve treatment selection and patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Circulating tumor cells,Proteomics,Personalized medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Justin M.

However, there are multiple pathways and subsequent subtypes of TMFs, with limited data on the various TMF types, commonality in blood, and clinical relevance. Here we evaluated n=120 metastatic breast cancer (mBC) blood samples for CTCs &#38; TMFs. We describe numerous types of TMFs with vastly different fusion phenotypes, including partial (i.e. some membrane interaction &#38; both cells retaining their original phenotypes), homodimeric (i.e. both cells with fused membranes &#38; sharing cytoplasm), cannibalistic (i.e. CTC within a CD14+ macrophage &#38; cells retaining their individual phenotypes), binucleated (i.e. both cells completely merge &#38; becoming one cell with dual expression phenotypes), and hyperploidy (i.e. multiple cells merge to form a large polyploid cell). As CTCs &#38; TMFs are isolated in conjunction from a single blood sample, we evaluated both CTCs &#38; all TMF subtypes to determine their prognostic and predictive values for aggressiveness of disease.<br \/>Methods: We categorized and enumerated the 5 forms of TMFs from a prospective pilot study using n=120 mBC pts that were starting new lines of treatment. Whole peripheral blood (7.5mL) was procured, filtered and stained using cytokeratin &#38; CD45\/CD14 to identify CTCs &#38; TMFs. We compared the presence of the various types of TMFs &#38; CTCs to pt&#8217;s progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) hazard ratios (HRs), analyzed by censored univariate analysis based on RECIST v1.1 over 24 months.<br \/>Results: CTCs were found in 39% (n=47\/120), with partial fusion TMFs in 26% (n=31\/120), homodimeric 2% (n=2\/120), cannibalistic 0% (n=0\/120), binucleated 2% (n=2\/120), hyperploidy 93% (n=113\/120). Presence of CTCs alone, binucleated, or hyperploidy TMFs were not prognostic for PFS (p=0.0988, p=0.4120, &#38; p=0.7615 respectively), or OS (p=0.2015, p=0.0845, p=0.1121 respectively). However, TMFs with partial or homodimeric fusion were prognostic for worse PFS (HR=2.2, p=0.0063 and HR=6.0, p=0.0305, respectively) and for worse OS (HR=2.8, p=0.0037 and HR=8.8, p=0.0271, respectively). Furthermore, combining pts with any TMFs into one group, minus hyperploidy, was highly significant for worse PFS (HR=2.9, 95%CI 1.7-5.0, p=0.0002) and worse OS (HR=3.8, 95%CI 2.0-7.5, p=0.0002), though certain subtypes of hyperploidy were also indicative of worse outcomes.<br \/>Conclusion: The study of TMFs is relativity limited and their existence is new in oncology. Here we detected and described TMFs in the blood of mBC pts while demonstrating an association with poor clinical outcomes. These data suggest TMF involvement in the pathogenic cascade of cancer and further understanding of their biology may be important in the study of tumorigenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Cancer initiating cells,Cancer markers,Tumor evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Daniel L.

While circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may be attributed to these locoregional metastases, detecting CTCs and their molecular profiling remains challenging. Here we report a novel strategy for isolating CTCs in OSCC. Secondly, we characterized the CTCs to prognosticate the disease outcome using their transcriptomic signature.<br \/>Methods: Keeping in view the inherent disadvantages of currently available CTC-isolation techniques, like the use of single marker or size-based isolation, we developed a novel FACS--based strategy, combining pre-enrichment by immunomagnetic depletion of CD45+ cells, followed by positive selection of CTCs using multiple FITC-conjugated epithelial markers (EpCAM, EGFR, CK) and EMT marker (Vimentin), with a novel gating strategy for isolating pure CTCs. Isolated CTCs were reconfirmed using various methods. CTCs and Primary tumors were isolated in 63 OSCC patients, and their transcriptomic signature was correlated with disease outcome.<br \/>Results: Seventy-one percent (45\/63) of patients were positive for CTCs, and associated with poor OS and DFS, while there is no difference between the proportion of CTC-positivity between early (23\/33;69%) and late (22\/30;73%) TNM stage. CTC-specific markers (EpCAM, EGFR, CK, and Vim) are expressed in various combinations, indicating extensive phenotypic heterogeneity. Importantly, EpCAM-positive CTCs were detected only in 46% (29\/63) patients, and patients with EpCAM-negative CTCs had worse OS (p=0.044*), indicating the importance of a multi-marker approach. On unsupervised hierarchical clustering of RNAseq data of isolated CTCs and primary tumors, we found that CTCs and primary tumors clustered separately, indicating that the CTCs are transcriptionally different from the primary tumors. Moreover, CTCs were clustered into two distinct sub-clusters with significantly different OS (<i><u>p=0.0004***<\/u><\/i>) and DFS (<i><u>p=0.0097<\/u><\/i>***), suggesting that the inter-patient transcriptomic heterogeneity of CTCs is an important prognostic factor. We found coagulation, IL-6 JAK STAT3 signaling, allograft rejection, complement, EMT, inflammatory response, heme metabolism, UV response, and ECM receptor interaction pathways significantly enriched in CTCs compared to the primary tumor. TNF-alpha signaling via NF-kB and KRAS signaling pathways were also positively enriched in CTCs with poor prognostic traits. Interestingly, for the first time, we found various Cancer\/Testis (CT) antigens upregulated in CTCs, while not detected in primary tumors.<br \/>Conclusion: Here we report a novel, technologically less difficult, cost-effective CTC isolation technique suitable for developing countries. We explored the prognostic implications of the extensive heterogeneity in CTCs isolated from OSCC patients for the first time.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Oral squamous cell carcinoma,Transcriptomic heterogeneity,Prognosis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anshika Chauhan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Geeta  S.

Copy number variations (CNVs) play an important role in molding the genomes of cancers and have been shown the clinical value for prognostic signature and therapeutic target. The current study aimed to evaluate CNVs at single-cell resolution and explore the potential clinical utility of tracking this key mechanism of cancer progression.<br \/>Methods: Blood samples were collected in Streck tubes from 40 stage II-IV cancer patients (5 prostate cancer, 15 non-small lung cancer (NSCLC), 20 breast cancer (BC)) before treatment. CTCs was identified as cells containing an intact nucleus, without CD45 expression, and with cytokeratin expression. Genomic analysis of chromosomal CNVs by low pass whole genome sequencing (Lp-WGS) and number of large-scale transitions (LSTs) calculation was performed in the CTCs.<br \/>Results: A total of 9 CTCs from 4 prostate cancer, 70 CTCs from 7 NSCLC, 22 CTCs from 9 breast cancer patients, representing a range of sizes, shapes, and protein expression levels of cytokeratin were identified. A total of 84 individual CTCs were successfully sequenced from 20 patients (1-6 CTCs\/patient). The selected highlights for gene CNVs include: 1) CXCR4 and ATM were detected as loss on single cell CTC (scCTC) level in BC; 2) MED12, an important regulator for maintaining accurate cytokinesis and survival, was detected as loss on scCTC level in NSCLC. A wide range of LST scores were observed among the 20 patient samples. Cell morphology analysis, phenotypic heterogeneity biomarker analysis and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) biomarker analysis using a previously developed HRD classifier<sup>1<\/sup> trained on genomic markers is still ongoing.<br \/>Conclusion: Our data demonstrated that Lp-WGS of DNA from CTCs can detect CNVs loss and assess disease heterogeneity at the single-cell level. Since genome-wide CNV profiles can be used to characterize genomic instability, it is anticipated that the integrative analysis of morphology and genomics in CTCs can potentially complement tissue and\/or ctDNA analysis to determine HRD, enabling in-depth investigation of tumor heterogeneity and individualized clinical assessment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,sing-cell whole genome sequencing,copy number variations ,genomic instability,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Danyi Wang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Giuseppe Locatelli<sup>2<\/sup>, Ioannis Gounaris<sup>3<\/sup>, Juergen Scheuenpflug<sup>2<\/sup>, Zheng Feng<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>EMD Serono, Billerica, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany,<sup>3<\/sup>Merck-Serono Ltd, Feltham, United Kingdom","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ffffeb26-6dd4-47e1-85c9-11f0f4354cde","ControlNumber":"4615","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;D.

Patients with metastatic disease had higher concordance compared to patients without metastasis of cancer (Pearson r 0.58 vs 0.39). bTMB and tTMB were most strongly correlated when tTMB was collected from metastatic lesions (Pearson r 0.92). No significant correlation was observed when tTMB was collected from lymph nodes (Pearson r 0.20).

The analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from these liquid biopsies is a particularly well-suited strategy for longitudinal monitoring of patients. In patients with HR+\/HER2- metastatic breast cancer (MBC), early detection of ESR1 and PIK3CA mutations is a key element to better personalize disease management. Among the technologies currently used for liquid biopsies, digital PCR (dPCR) has the advantage of being among the fastest and least expensive, providing robust results along with unmatched sensitivity as compared to other methods. Until recently, however, dPCR has been previously limited by multiplex capability. The recent availability of the 6-color version of the naica&#174; platform (Stilla Technologies) has allowed us to develop a single-well multiplexed assay that combines an 11 pathogenic mutation ESR1 assay with a 21 mutation PIK3CA assay, for a combined total of 32 ESR1 and PIK3CA mutations. Here we present data on this new high-plex dPCR panel. As ESR1 and PIK3CA analyses are often requested together, this new screening assay represents a significant saving of time and resources for the analysis of our MBC patients with a relative ease of implementation and analysis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,Mutation detection,Droplet digital PCR,Metastatic tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Veronique Quillien<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Julien Corne<sup><\/sup>, Thibault De la Motte Rouge<sup><\/sup>, Fanny Le Du<sup><\/sup>, Florence Godey<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Centre Eugene Marquis, Rennes, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d36efd95-7cec-46ab-afb3-b9ee0c73aca9","ControlNumber":"6364","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>V.

We report here our longitudinal study of these circulating biomarkers in resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. Although the overall 5-year survival rate of PDAC is low (~6%), truly resectable patients are expected to have better outcomes than non-resectable PDAC patients, especially if liquid biopsy can help guide anticancer treatment selection.<br \/>Method: We evaluated temporal changes in CTCs, cfDNA, and ctDNA in peripheral blood samples in a cohort of patients with resectable PDAC treated with pre-operative chemotherapy and surgical excision. Five PDAC survivors in complete remission for three years without evidence of disease served as negative controls. Samples of peripheral blood were collected prior to the start of treatment and every two weeks while patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by surgical excision of the pancreatic tumor. CTCs were enumerated using a previously reported microfluidic device [1] that integrates immunoaffinity-based isolation with size-based filtration, while cfDNA and ctDNA were measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR).<br \/>Results: Among the initial seven patients who have completed the treatment sequences [2], CTCs were detectable in all patients (100%) at some points during treatment, but only 50% of patients had detectable CTCs before the start of chemotherapy. Median cfDNA concentrations were comparable to those negative controls throughout treatment. Using ddPCR to analyze peripheral blood samples, KRAS mutations were detected in in 71% of patients during anticancer therapy, but only in 29% patients prior to treatment. Overall, the majority of circulating biomarkers (81% for CTCs and 91% for ctDNA) were detected in blood samples collected after the start of neoadjuvant therapy and before surgery.<br \/>Conclusion: This study suggests that a longitudinal study of circulating biomarkers provides additional data compared to single-point liquid biopsy, and that biologic &#8220;release&#8221; of biomarkers due to therapy can increase detectability. -Further study is needed to determine the clinical utility of liquid biopsy for resectable PDAC patients.<br \/>[1] Chen, et al., <i>Angew.

The use of ctDNA as a surrogate for tissue DNA is increasingly popular, and advances in the detection and characterization of ctDNA has enabled liquid biopsy assay integration into clinical utilization. However, an innate challenge with measurement of ctDNA is the requirement for highly sensitive quantitation to reliably detect rare genetic aberrations. Digital PCR has emerged as a powerful technology addressing the needs for next-generation analysis of liquid biopsies samples. Having reliable assays for analysis of key oncology targets help drive adoption of this technology into real-world applications. The exquisite sensitivity of digital PCR requires sample preparation methods that reduce variation, making automation of any manual steps highly desirable. Automation also provides flexibility to scale up as testing volumes increase while simultaneously decreasing overall complexity for the operator. Here we present an automated workflow for ctDNA extraction and analysis using the Maxprep&#8482; Liquid Handler, Maxwell&#174; extraction system (Promega Corporation), and a new, high-throughput digital PCR consumable, the Ruby Chip (Stilla Technologies). This ultra-sensitive detection for liquid biopsy samples was performed using a high-plex dPCR assay.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,Multiplex automation,Mutation detection,Droplet digital PCR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Michael Granitsiotis<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Kimberly Gutierrez<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Doug Horejsh<sup>2<\/sup>, Monica Yue<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Stilla Technologies, Burlington, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Promega Corporation, Madison, WI","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"25930d6a-8d3d-4a1d-a7e6-be9923bbe2b6","ControlNumber":"6424","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.
