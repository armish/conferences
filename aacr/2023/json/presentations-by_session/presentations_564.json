The most common mutation in BRAF is V600E (Class I), which is found in &#62;70% in these cancers. Despite the clinical success of approved small molecule inhibitors of BRAF V600E (vemurafenib, dabrafenib and encorafenib), this remains an area of unmet medical need because nearly all patients progress, due to either primary or acquired resistance. A bifunctional degradation activating compound (or BiDAC<sup>TM<\/sup> degrader) may address the liabilities of approved drugs by overcoming, or preventing the emergence of, resistance to BRAF inhibitors.<b> <\/b>Here we describe CFT1946, an orally bioavailable cereblon-based BiDAC degrader of BRAF V600 mutant proteins, and provide an overview of the medicinal chemistry path leading to its discovery. CFT1946 degrades BRAF V600 mutant proteins, while maintaining exquisite selectivity against the proteome, sparing wild type BRAF (BRAF-WT), ARAF, and CRAF. In A375 cells, CFT1946 potently degraded BRAF V600E and inhibited ERK phosphorylation and cell growth while having no effect in the mutant KRAS, BRAF-WT driven cell line HCT116. In the A375 xenograft model, oral delivery of CFT1946 at 10 mg\/kg PO BID resulted in deeper and more durable tumor regression compared to a clinically relevant dose of encorafenib. Further evaluation of CFT1946 in an engineered, clinically relevant BRAFi-resistant A375 cell line (endogenous BRAF V600E + engineered expression of NRAS Q61K) demonstrated that CFT1946 both degraded BRAF V600E and caused a loss of viability in these cells, while treatment with encorafenib had no effect. In xenografts derived from this BRAFi-resistant cell line, oral dosing of CFT1946 as a single agent led to tumor growth inhibition, while treatment with a clinically relevant dose of encorafenib had no effect on tumor growth. Furthermore, dosing CFT1946 in combination with the MEK inhibitor, trametinib, resulted in significant tumor regression, whereas combining encorafenib with the same dose of trametinib had no effect. The medicinal chemistry campaign resulting in CFT1946 focused on the improvement of <i>in vivo<\/i> pharmacokinetics and rational linker design to achieve high oral bioavailability in a beyond Rule of 5 heterobifunctional degrader.<b> <\/b>The preclinical data presented herein support the planned Phase 1\/2 clinical trial of CFT1946 for the treatment of BRAF-V600 mutant solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CH01-04 Drug design,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BRAF,Drug design,Pharmacokinetics,Targeted Protein Degradation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yanke Liang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Mathew E.

While several TCE molecules have now advanced to approval, clinical development has been challenging, especially in the solid tumor setting. There are few solid tumor surface antigens that are tumor-specific, and antigens with even low levels of expression in normal tissue can be recognized by a TCE and result in on-target off-tumor toxicity. To overcome this challenge, we have developed AMG 305, a first-in-class, dual targeting BiTE<sup>&#174;<\/sup> (bispecific T cell engager) molecule that requires binding to both P-cadherin (CDH3) and mesothelin (MSLN) for potent cytotoxic activity. Immunohistochemistry analysis shows that CDH3 and MSLN are co-expressed in multiple solid tumor types. In normal tissues, immunostaining shows fewer tissues have overlapping co-expression than expression of just one or the other target. AMG 305 relies on an avidity-based approach to engage T cells to preferentially kill CDH3+MSLN+ tumor cells, with limited activity against normal cells that express only one of the target antigens. In vitro, AMG 305 induces potent cytotoxicity against tumor cells co-expressing CDH3 and MSLN, with greatly attenuated activity against cells expressing only CDH3 or MSLN. In vivo, AMG 305 demonstrates dose-dependent antitumor activity in a CDH3+MSLN+ xenograft tumor model. AMG 305 was clinically well-tolerated in a nonclinical safety study in cynomolgus monkey. Data from IND-enabling preclinical studies support initiation of the first-in-human study of AMG 305 in CDH3+MSLN+ solid tumors in 2023.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM02-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Solid tumors,T cell engager,Mesothelin, MSLN,P-cadherin, CDH3,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Elizabeth Pham<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Petra Lutterbuese<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Petra Deegen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Natalie Mariano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katja Matthes<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joachim Wahl<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pamela Bogner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joan Lane<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristin Lewis Wilson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rodolfo Yabut<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Virginie Naegele<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ines Ullrich<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Stephanie Everts<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Markus Muenz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Thomas Boehm<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sabine Stienen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Angela Coxon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Peter Kufer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tobias Raum<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julie M.

Analogous to breast cancer, advanced UC is a heterogeneous disease, with luminal and basal subtypes. For luminal breast cancer, small molecule targeting of the lineage-defining transcription factor estrogen receptor (ER) is a demonstrated and effective therapeutic strategy. Two-thirds of advanced UC is classified as luminal, which is characterized by overexpression of the urothelial lineage-defining transcription factor PPARG. Thus, small molecule targeting of PPARG in luminal UC may serve as a therapeutic strategy analogous to ER in luminal breast cancer. While PPARG agonists have been well studied in the context of metabolic disease, PPARG inhibitors have received far less attention. Previously reported PPARG inhibitors display minimal phenotypic activity in pre-clinical UC models, calling into question the performance of these molecules, or alternatively, the role of PPARG as a survival lineage oncogene in UC. Leveraging reconstituted, multi-component PPARG biochemical systems, we first identified the limitations of previous tool compounds and then discovered a novel, covalent lead series with unique, context-dependent electrophilic properties. These efforts lead to the discovery of FX-909, a first-in-class covalent PPARG inverse agonist with powerful repressive conformational biasing activity. FX-909 is highly potent in cells (IC<sub>50<\/sub>=1 nM), demonstrates high specificity for PPARG (&#62;2000-fold selective over PPARA\/PPARD), and elicits robust <i>in vitro<\/i> growth inhibition in UC cell lines with activated PPARG signaling. Tumor regression was observed in UMUC9 (PPARG amplification) and HT1197 (RXRA<sup>S427F<\/sup> hotspot mutation) xenograft models of UC with oral dosing at 1 mg\/kg. Predictable, on-target and reversible pharmacology was observed at FX-909 doses above 1 mg\/kg, mimicking PPARG loss-of-function mutations with notable tissue remodeling in adipose tissue and the normal urothelium. These collective findings corroborate the role of PPARG as a key UC survival oncogene and suggest that FX-909 will be an effective therapy for patients with advanced UC harboring the luminal subtype.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Invited Speaker","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET06-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors,Transcription factor,Bladder cancer,Therapeutics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Robert Sims<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jennifer A.
