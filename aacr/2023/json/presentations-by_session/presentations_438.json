[{"Abstract":"Background: Cell cycle dysregulation is a hallmark of cancer, resulting in unregulated cell proliferation and, eventually, tumor development. Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) is a cell cycle regulatory protein that is involved in cell cycle maintenance. CDK1 has been discovered to be substantially elevated in a several tumors and is linked to poor overall and relapse-free survival. The aim of this study is to understand the regulation role of <i>Helicobacter Pylori<\/i> infection and inflammation on CDK1 expression in gastric cancer.<br \/>Methods: Using TCGA data and our integrated comprehensive gene expression analysis, we found a significant overexpression of CDK1 in gastric cancer human and mouse tissues. We detected overexpression of CDK1 in human and mouse gastric glands in response to <i>H. pylori<\/i> infection. Our data demonstrated that <i>H. pylori<\/i> infection induced phosphorylation (S536) and activation of NF-kB in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, <i>H. pylori<\/i> infection and TNF-&#945; treatment increased the CDK1 mRNA and protein levels in gastric cancer cell lines. Using the ChIP assay, we detected direct biding of NF-&#954;B on the CDK1 promoter regulating its transcription. CDK1 promoted activation of the &#946;-catenin signaling pathway. Using the pTOP\/pFOP luciferase reporter assays, as a measure of &#946;-catenin\/TCF transcription activity, we confirmed CDK1-dependent activation of &#946;-catenin in response to <i>H. pylori<\/i> infection. Pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of CDK1 reversed these effects and decreased number and size of gastric tumors organoid from mouse and human.<br \/>Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate NF-kB-mediated induction of CDK1 expression in response to <i>H. pylori<\/i> infection with subsequent activation of tumorigenic &#946;-catenin signaling. This novel regulatory link between infection, CDK1, and &#946;-catenin suggests the importance of considering CDK1 inhibitors in gastric cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK,Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,NF-&#954;B,Tumor progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Marwah M.

Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4)\/(CDK6) are critical mediators of cellular transition into S phase and important for the initiation, growth, and survival of many cancers. Activated CDK4\/CDK6 complexes phosphorylate Rb1, reduce their binding affinities and release Rb1-containing transcription repressor complexes from E2F transcription factors, resulting in activation of E2F controlled cell cycle genes and progression of the cell cycle. At present three CDK4\/CDK6 inhibitors are approved for the treatment of ER+\/HER2- breast cancer, and are being explored in other cancer indications as well. Previously we described a novel brain penetrant CDK4\/CDK6 inhibitor, PRT3645, that exhibits single digit nanomolar biochemical potency against CDK4\/CDK6 and &#62;2000-fold selectivity against CDK1, CDK2 and CDK9. PRT3645 inhibits cellular phosphorylation of Rb and exhibits a protein binding-adjusted cellular IC50 of &#60;300 nM. PRT3645 exhibits favorable in-vitro safety pharmacology and ADME properties, including increased brain penetration, and demonstrates oral bioavailability across rodents, dog, and non-human primates. In addition to robust monotherapy activity observed in preclinical models of ER+\/HER2- breast cancer, we explored the activity of PRT3645 in other tumor types as well as in combination with other targeted therapies. In NSCLC, PRT3645 treatment resulted in significant inhibition of cell lines that harbor activation of the RAS\/MEK\/ERK pathway in proliferation assays and demonstrated comparable high synergy scores when combined with clinically approved covalent KRAS G12C inhibitors. In-vivo, oral PRT3645 was well tolerated and induced anti-tumor efficacy in two KRAS G12C mutant xenograft models that harbor the CDKN2A (p16) deletion. Anti-tumor efficacy was further improved when PRT3645 was combined with KRAS\/MEK inhibitors in xenograft models and the combination therapy was well tolerated. In addition, we explored combinations of PRT3645 with a brain penetrant receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), an approved treatment for patients with advanced HER2+ breast cancer, including patients with brain metastases. In a HER2+ orthotopic human breast cancer brain metastasis model, PRT3645 was highly efficacious in combination with HER2 kinase inhibition and enhanced median survival significantly. In summary, PRT3645 demonstrates an excellent balance of potency, selectivity, PK parameters across species and brain penetrance. In preclinical studies, PRT3645 was highly efficacious when combined with KRAS\/MEK inhibitors, and with a brain penetrant HER2 receptor TKI, both in-vitro and in-vivo. PRT3645 has advanced into Phase 1 clinical trials (<i>NCT05538572<\/i>).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell cycle,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,KRAS,HER2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yue Zou<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Srijita Dhar<sup>1<\/sup>, Kirsten Gallagher<sup>1<\/sup>, Andrew Buesking<sup>2<\/sup>, Sarah Pawley<sup>2<\/sup>, Ryan Holmes<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiaowei Wu<sup>2<\/sup>, Katarina Rohlfing<sup>2<\/sup>, Min Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Joseph Rager<sup>2<\/sup>, Tom Emm<sup>2<\/sup>, Stefan Ruepp<sup>2<\/sup>, Miles Cowart<sup>2<\/sup>, Jing Ni<sup>3<\/sup>, Jean Zhao<sup>3<\/sup>, Bruce Ruggeri<sup>2<\/sup>, Andrew Combs<sup>2<\/sup>, Kris Vaddi<sup>2<\/sup>, Sandy Geeganage<sup>2<\/sup>, Ashish Juvekar<sup>4<\/sup>, Sang Hyun Lee<sup>2<\/sup>, Peggy Scherle<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Biology, Prelude Therapeutics Inc., Wilmington, DE,<sup>2<\/sup>Prelude Therapeutics Inc., Wilmington, DE,<sup>3<\/sup>Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA,<sup>4<\/sup>Modifi Bio, New Haven, CT","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2bbc445b-c1fc-4c1f-97d5-2f38d2b7640c","ControlNumber":"5061","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;Y.

Interestingly, preliminary results have suggested that the second-generation, orally bioavailable and clinical-stage CDK4\/6 inhibitor, ON123300 (narazaciclib), may be effective in preclinical models of BTKi-resistant MCL. We compared the efficacy and safety of ON123300 vs the approved CDK inhibitors palbociclib, abemaciclib or ribociclib, in association with various BTKi, in a panel of 10 MCL cell lines with distinct sensitivity to the first-in-class BTKi, ibrutinib, or the second generation acalabrutinib. We evaluated the effects of these combinations by CellTiter-Glo proliferation assay, FACS-mediated analysis of cell cycle and apoptosis, RT-PCR and western blot. Efficacy and safety of ON123300 in vivo was evaluated in a chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) xenograft model of MCL. We observed that ON123300 exhibited a significant antitumor activity in MCL cell lines independently of their sensitivity to ibrutinib, with IC50 at 72h ranging from 0.7 to 7.1&#181;M (mean: 3.61&#177;2.1&#181;M), while it achieved a 32% tumor growth inhibition, with no detectable toxicity, in the CAM-MCL model. In vitro, ON123300 demonstrated a superior activity than palbociclib and ribociclib, and a similar effect that abemaciclib. Interestingly, ON123300 exhibited an antitumor activity comparable to ibrutinib but was more effective than acalabrutinib. ON123300 single agent treatment repressed several positive regulators of the G2\/M cell cycle phase and triggered the accumulation of the CDK inhibitors p21, p16, and phospho-p27, with the consequent loss of phospho-Histone H3 and phospho-CDK2. Accordingly, ON123300 treatment evoked a 20-35% increase in G1 cell cycle fraction at 24h, which preceded the ignition of mitochondrial apoptosis. When combined with ibrutinib, rather than with acalabrutinib, ON123300 exhibited a significant antitumor activity with synergistic combination indexes in both BTK-sensitive and BTK-resistant cell lines. This phenomenon was associated with a slight but constant (+10-15%) augmentation of G1 blockade, histone H3\/CDK2 dephosphorylation and p27\/p16 accumulation in cells exposed to ibrutinib-ON123300 combination, with no detectable potentiation of apoptosis. In conclusion, ON123300 is safe and effective as single agent in preclinical models of MCL, including BTKi-resistant cases. Due to its complete distinct MoA from BTKi involving the direct modulation of cell cycle, ON123300, but not abemaciclib or palbociclib, can achieve significant synergistic activity in combination with ibrutinib, and in lower extent with acalabrutinib, especially in BTKi-resistant MCL cases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ibrutinib,Drug resistance,CDK4\/6 inhibitors,Drug synergy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nuria Profitos-Peleja<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Marcelo L.

The current standard of care in advanced HR+ breast cancer includes endocrine therapy (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, etc) and CDK4\/6 inhibitors. CDK4\/6 inhibitors significantly prolong survival and is now the general accepted choice of drug in first line. Despite the enormous clinical benefit, there remains a substantial portion of patients who ultimately develop resistance against CDK4\/6 inhibitors. Many mechanisms have been proposed for CDK4\/6 inhibitor resistant, including upregulation of CDK4, CDK6, Cyclin E, and others. Recently studies have linked the hippo pathway to CDK6 upregulation and resulting in CDK4\/6 inhibitor resistance. We have set up a kinase library screen for kinase inhibitors that downregulate CDK6 amplification and further assess for reversal of resistance. We discovered staurosporine and the PI3K inhibitor PIK-75 as small molecules that potently downregulate CDK6 expression in breast cancer cells. We further confirmed that these compounds reverse the resistance towards CDK4\/6 inhibitors in CDK6 amplification cells. By kinase profiling combined with a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen, we discovered the mechanisms that resulted in CDK6 downregulation and modulation of the hippo pathway to reverse the CDK4\/6 inhibitor resistance. Our discovery has implications for therapeutic development in this group of patients posing a huge unmet need.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK4\/6 inhibitors,Breast cancer,Hippo pathway,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Chung-Jen Yu<sup>1<\/sup>, Yong-Ji Zhuang<sup>1<\/sup>, Ting-Yi Lin<sup>1<\/sup>, Ta-Chung Chao<sup>2<\/sup>, Chun-Yu Liu<sup>2<\/sup>, Ling-Ming Tseng<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Jiun-I Lai<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>National Yang-Ming Chiao Tung University, taipei, Taiwan,<sup>2<\/sup>Taipei Veterans General Hospital, taipei, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5c816031-dd9f-4d9d-bf62-35e534d28c11","ControlNumber":"8191","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

Q901 is currently in Phase 1\/2 clinical trial for patients with selected advanced solid tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05394103). In the preclinical models, Q901 treatment induces DNA damage response (DDR) impairment markers, particularly ones involved in the double-strand break repair mechanisms. This opens up broad range of possibilities for new combination regimen that could benefit from the accumulated DNA damages caused by Q901 treatment.<br \/>Methods: Various combinations have been tested to evaluate potential clinical regimens in multiple solid tumor models. Two different BRCA wild-type ovarian cancer A2780 and OVCAR3 models, an estrogen receptor positive MCF7 breast cancer model, or a syngeneic RENCA mouse renal cancer model was tested with Q901 in combination with poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), an estrogen receptor (ER) PROTAC degrader, or an anti-PD-1 antibody, respectively.<br \/>Results: In the A2780 model, the PARPi alone group showed 15% TGI (tumor growth inhibition), but significant tumor regression (104% TGI) was observed in the Q901 and PARPi combination. In the OVCAR3 model, the Q901 and PARPi combination group showed 105% TGI, whereas the PARPi alone group showed 38% TGI. In the MCF7 model, SERD alone showed 64% TGI and Q901 combination with SERD showed 94% TGI. Remarkable tumor regression (111% TGI) was observed in the MCF7 model combining ER PROTAC and Q901, whereas ER PROTAC alone group showed 55% TGI. In the RENCA model, the anti-PD-1 antibody alone group showed 13.2% TGI and the combination of Q901 and anti-PD-1 antibody showed 66% TGI. In summary, these preclinical model studies demonstrated significant additive\/synergistic effects of the Q901 combination on tumor growth inhibition.<br \/>Conclusion: The non-clinical data demonstrate that Q901 not only has a potential as a single agent,but can also be used in combination with other therapeutic strategies to develop next-generation cancer therapeutics to potentially address unmet medical needs.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK7,DNA damage response,DNA double-strand break,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Donghoon Yu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yeejin Jeon<sup>1<\/sup>, YoonJi Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Seung-Joo Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Jaeseung Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Hyerim Jung<sup>2<\/sup>, Tae-Kyung Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Kiyean Nam<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Qurient Co.

Inhibition of CDK9 induces transcription-replication conflicts (T-R conflicts), leading to replication stress. AZD4573, a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor, showed anti-tumor effects in acute myeloid leukemia <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Recently it is being evaluated in phase 2 clinical trial (NCT04630756). However, the anti-tumor effect of AZD4573 is unknown in breast cancer. Thus, we investigated the anti-tumor effect of AZD4573 in breast cancer cells and explored the underlying mechanism.<br \/>Methods: To evaluate the antitumor effect <i>in vitro<\/i>, MTT assays were preformed using increasing concentration of AZD4573 (doses range : 0-100 nM). The IC<sub>50<\/sub> values were calculated using Sigma Plot software. Cell cycle analysis was performed using flow cytometry analysis. The expression of signal transduction molecules was determined using quantitative PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence. Apoptotic cell death was verified by annexin-V assay. DNA strand breaks and repair efficacy were evaluated through alkaline comet assay. siRNA knock-down system was used to confirm the action mechanism.<br \/>Results: SK-BR-3, HCC70, HCC1937 and ZR-75-1 were sensitive to AZD4573 with IC<sub>50<\/sub> ranging from 9.16-25.81 nM, whereas T47D and HCC1428 were less-sensitive (IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#62;100 nM), as assessed by MTT assay. After treatment of AZD4573, sensitive and less-sensitive cells showed increased T-R conflicts in 10 minutes. T-R conflicts were maintained in SK-BR-3, HCC70, HCC1937 and ZR-75-1 for 3 hours, but T-R conflicts disappeared immediately in T47D and HCC1428 cells. Moreover, expression of &#947;-H2AX, cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-3 was increased, indicating the induction of apoptosis in sensitive cells. Contrary to these results, &#947;-H2AX induction and apoptosis were not observed in T47D and HCC1428 cells. siRNA knock-down of CDK9 in HCC1937 resulted in an increase of T-R conflicts, &#947;-H2AX, with induction of PARP cleavage and caspase-3 cleavage.<br \/>Conclusion: AZD4573 induced T-R conflicts and subsequent DNA damage. Accumulation of DNA damage caused caspase-3-dependent apoptotic cell death in sensitive breast cancer cells. However, less-sensitive breast cancer cells resolved T-R conflicts immediately and maintained genomic stability. These data suggest that AZD4573 induced significant anti-tumor effects by apoptotic cell death through accumulation of DNA damage, following T-R conflicts.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK inhibitor,Transcription-Replication conflicts,DNA damage,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Minyoung Lee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, So Hyeon Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Sujin Ham<sup>1<\/sup>, Hae Min Hwang<sup>1<\/sup>, Youlim Noh<sup>1<\/sup>, Yu-Jin Kim<sup>1<\/sup>, Ahrum Min<sup>1<\/sup>, Jinyong Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Dae-Won Lee<sup>2<\/sup>, Kyung-Hun Lee<sup>2<\/sup>, Seock-Ah Im<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c711296a-526f-48c9-a47c-4d89ed8f57c1","ControlNumber":"2358","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

A large cohort of patients, however, eventually relapse to CDK4\/6 therapy. To further empower the CDK therapy, simultaneous targeting of CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 has been proposed as a new strategy based on the finding that abnormal activation of CDK2\/CyclinE1 due to CCNE1 gene amplification is determined the key resistant mechanism to CDK4\/6 inhibition. Here we present preclinical data of TY-0540, a novel CDK2\/4\/6 inhibitor for the treatment of breast cancer that is resistant<b> <\/b>to CDK4\/6 inhibition. TY-0540 demonstrates high selectivity against CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 compared to that of CDK1, CDK7, and CDK9 in a CDK panel screening. <i>In vitro<\/i> cell proliferation data shows that tumor cell lines OVCAR3 and HCC1806, both bearing CCNE1 amplification, are highly sensitive to TY-0540 treatment. To test the effectiveness of the clinical candidate compound on CDK4\/6i resistance models, two Palbociclib resistant cell populations (T47D-R, HCC1428-R) were in-house generated via gradient exposure of the cells to Palbociclib. As expected, TY-0540 potently inhibits T47D-R and HCC1428-R cell proliferation whereas Palbociclib only confers mild interruption to cell proliferation. TY-0540 abolishes Rb phosphorylation at all its three phosphorylation sites and down-regulates E2F1, FOXM1, and c-Myc expression levels in the model cell line OVCAR3. Meanwhile, cell cycle analysis suggests the occurrence of strong G1 arrest at 24 hours after TY-0540 treatment. Consistent with the <i>in vitro<\/i> results, TY-0540 treatment confers extraordinary in vivo efficacy with a spectrum of tumor CDX mouse models and PDX models in mice. To examine the <i>in vivo<\/i> effectiveness of TY-0540 over resistance models to CDK4\/6 inhibition, we developed Palbociclib-resistant MCF7 tumor model (Palbociclib-R-MCF7) through a combination of <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> evolution of the cells under the selection pressure of Palbociclib. In agreement with its mode of action, TY-0540 is able to suppress Palbociclib-R-MCF7 tumor growth and maintain tumor size at stable disease status. Taken together, we have identified a potent CDK2\/4\/6 inhibitor which may grant new therapeutic opportunities for cancer patients who relapse or refractory to CDK4\/6 signaling blockage therapy. #Meihua Li and Chengshan Niu contributed equally to this work. *Jun Li, Meihua Li and Chengshan Niu are the correspondent authors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell cycle inhibitors,CDK inhibitor,Cyclin E,Kinase inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Meihua Li<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chengshan Niu<sup>2<\/sup>, Mingtao Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Kaige Ji<sup>2<\/sup>, Hui Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Shengli Dong<sup>1<\/sup>, Yan Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Qinguo Meng<sup>2<\/sup>, Yuge Dou<sup>2<\/sup>, Yijun Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Rui Wu<sup>1<\/sup>, Yian Tu<sup>1<\/sup>, Chao Zhou<sup>1<\/sup>, Apeng Liang<sup>1<\/sup>, Huan Wang<sup>3<\/sup>, Rongzhen Ni<sup>3<\/sup>, Aishen Gong<sup>3<\/sup>, Hui Su<sup>3<\/sup>, Mingyu Jiang<sup>3<\/sup>, Feng Xing<sup>3<\/sup>, Shaoqing Chen<sup>3<\/sup>, Xiugui Chen<sup>3<\/sup>, Jun Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Yusheng Wu<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>TYK Medicines, Inc., Huzhou, China,<sup>2<\/sup>TYK Medicines, Inc., Zhengzhou, China,<sup>3<\/sup>TYK Medicines, Inc., Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e0a79895-9ef8-4c49-8371-576152da2963","ControlNumber":"4558","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Members of this family have been shown to be involved in the regulation of many critical cellular processes, including the regulation of cell cycle progression, gene transcription and neuronal function. Deregulated CDK activity has been observed frequently in human cancer and other diseases. Enzymatic kinase activity of CDKs has been found to depend on the formation of complexes with regulatory proteins of the Cyclin family and requires in some cases the presence of additional complex partners, like MAT1 for CDK7\/Cyclin H. To date, at least 15 different Cyclins have been described. For some CDKs it has been shown that they can also be activated by binding to proteins distinct from classical Cyclins. However, even while the 20 canonical CDKs share significant structural homology, they regulate very different functions of cell growth and development, partially due to their inherent substrate specificity but also regulated by their respective Cyclin partners. During the past 30 years several CDKs have been subject to extensive study resulting in a multitude of publications. This includes specifically CDK1, CDK2 and CDK4\/6 and to a lesser extend CDK7 and CDK9. Other CDKs have been studied much less extensively and consequently the accumulated knowledge about their biological function and regulation is very limited. CDK15 (also known as PFTK2 or ALS2CR7) is one of these understudied members of the CDK family, with less than 20 publications in PubMed and the search term \"CDK15\" in contrast to more than 8600 hits for \"CDK2\". Its biological function is largely obscure even while evidence was presented that CDK15 is involved in the regulation of breast and colorectal cancer. Comparable to all other members of the CDK family, recombinantly overexpressed purified CDK15 does not exhibit detectable in-vitro activity and to date no Cyclin or other activating complex partner for CDK15 has been published. Since CDK inhibitors have been in the focus of interest at least since the approval of the first candidate (Palbociclib) for the treatment of ER+\/HER+ breast cancer, testing the selectivity of other drug candidates within the complete group of CDKs is critically important to avoid unwanted off-target effects and toxicity. In order to enable in-vitro activity studies with CDK15 we evaluated different CDK15 constructs in combination with a comprehensive panel of different Cyclins using the baculo virus expression system. CDK15 and the respective Cyclins were co-expressed in insect cells, purified by affinity chromatography and tested for in-vitro activity using a panel of generic, broad-spectrum protein kinase substrates. We will present data on the identification of CDK15 activating Cyclins and the biochemical characterization of the in-vitro kinase activity of such CDK15\/Cyclin complexes including a panel of kinase inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK,CDK15,in-vitro activity,Cyclin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Daniel Mueller<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Constance Ketterer<sup><\/sup>, Diane Kraemer<sup><\/sup>, Carolin Heidemann-Dinger<sup><\/sup>, Lena Pilgermayer<sup><\/sup>, Thomas Weber<sup><\/sup>, Andreas Gericke<sup><\/sup>, Frank Totzke<sup><\/sup>, Michael  H.

Currently, trilaciclib, palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib that bear dual specificities against CDK4 and CDK6 have been approved for clinical usage, and more CDK4\/6 targeted agents are actively under clinical evaluations, among which, TY-302, a novel CDK4\/6 inhibitor being developed by TYK Medicines, is under Phase II trial (NCT04433494). To further drive the potential of pharmacological regulation of cancer cell cycle, here we report a novel CDK7 kinase inhibitor TY-2699a towards clinical investigation in 2023. CDK7 is a kinase at the core of transcription and also functions in regulating cell cycle progression. CDK7 overexpression has been identified in a wide spectrum of tumor tissues including triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), ovarian carcinoma (OC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and pancreatic cancer, and has been correlated to poor prognosis in the diseases. These malignant pathological profiles make CDK7 a pivotal target for the development of novel cancer therapy. Several CDK7 targeted agents, such as SY-5609 and Samuraciclib (CT7001), are under development. TYK Medicines is also committed to provide novel yet safe CDK7 kinase inhibitor. Our data show that TY-2699a potently inhibits the kinase activity of CDK7 in the form of CDK7\/Cyclin H\/MAT1 kinase complex (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 9.5 nM) with high selectivity compared to that with CDK1\/Cyclin A2, CDK2\/Cyclin E1, CDK4\/Cyclin D1, and CDK6\/Cyclin D1. The screening of a panel of cancer cell lines revealed strong anti-cell proliferation activities of TY-2699a compared to that of the reference compound, and the phenotypic findings are underscored by TY-2699a-dependent cell cycle disruption. Our data demonstrate that TY-2699a triggers G2 cell cycle arrest, and induces apoptosis in tested cancer cells (HCC70, and MDA-MB-468), but not in hTERT-immortalized normal cell (RPE-hTERT). <i>In vivo<\/i> studies show that TY-2699a confers significant efficacies in tested CDX mouse models of HCC70 (TNBC), OVCAR3 (OC), and MV-4-11(AML) in a dose-dependent manner. To further validate the anti-tumor activity of the agent, BR5010, a TNBC PDX model was employed to assess the response to TY-2699a treatment. Our data show that the efficacy of TY-2699a at 3 mg\/kg, bid <i>&#215;<\/i> 21 days was similar to that of the reference compound CT7001 at 100 mg\/kg, qd <i>&#215;<\/i> 21 days, and the efficacy of TY-2699a at 6 mg\/kg, bid <i>&#215;<\/i> 21 days was significantly better than that of CT7001 at 100 mg\/kg, qd <i>&#215;<\/i> 21 days in BR5010 mouse model.<b> <\/b>In summary, we report that TY-2699a is a highly selective and potent CDK7 kinase inhibitor with an acceptable toxicity profile within the therapeutic window.

It binds with cyclin C to regulate the transcription. By modulation of various gene expression programs, CDK8 associated with the mediator complex to sustain proliferation and viability of cancer cells. CDK8 has been identified as an important factor in cancer occurrence and development. It also involves in the regulation of cancer cell stress response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, assists tumor cell invasion, metastasis and drug resistance. Therefore inhibition of CDK8 is regarded as a promising target for cancer therapy. ABM-3249 was discovered as a potent and selective CDK8 inhibitor with a novel chemical structure. It inhibited CDK8 kinase activity in biochemical assay and cellular binding assay, with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 1.4 nM and 19nM respectively. ABM-3249 displayed good kinase selectivity: &#60;50% inhibition on all other CDK family members at 1uM. Consistently, ABM-3249 reduced STAT1-S727 phosphorylation with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of less than 100nM. ABM-3249 showed good ADME properties with high oral bioavailability (~90%) in rodents. In efficacy studies, ABM-3249 exhibited excellent anti-tumor activities in multiple in vivo models. In an AML MV4-11 xenograft model at 25mpk oral dosing ABM-3249 achieved complete remission in all mice within 17 days and no tumor recurrence within one month after drug withdrawal.

As overexpression of D-type cyclins is commonly observed in gastric cancer cells, the use of CDK4\/6 inhibitors could represent a viable alternative for gastric cancer treatment. Nonetheless, senescent cell can synthesize and secrete a plethora of bioactive molecules (a feature known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, SASP) with the potential of modifying the tumor microenvironment in ways that could be therapeutically deleterious. Among processes that are upregulated in most senescent cells, autophagy has received great attention during the last years. So far, however, the role of autophagy in the modulation of SASPs has yet to be clarified. Previous work from our lab has revealed an increased autophagic flux in gastric cancer cell lines undergoing drug-induced senescence, suggesting a regulatory role in the implementation of this modality of cellular senescence. More specifically, the secretory phenotype of senescent gastric cancer cells seems to depend on the autophagy status.<br \/>Materials and Methods: In order to determine the role of autophagy in the modulation of the SASP, cellular senescence was pharmacologically triggered in gastric cancer cell lines (AGS, MKN-45) through inhibition of CDK4\/6 activity (0.5-1.0 &#956;M of Palbociclib for 48 and 96 hours), with or without the concomitant inhibition of autophagy by either genetic (knocking down ATG5) or pharmacologic (treatment with 0.5 &#956;M of Spautin-1) approaches. The expression of factors secreted by senescent cells under different experimental conditions was analyzed from conditioned media; and the same conditioned media were used in assays aimed to assess migration, invasion, and cell proliferation of non-senescent cells.<br \/>Results and Discussion: Inhibition of autophagy in senescent cells led to a downregulation in the expression of proinflammatory molecules that were overexpressed in autophagy-proficient senescent cells (MIF, IL-8, IL1&#946;). Unlike conditioned media derived from AGS cells, conditioned media derived from senescent MKN-45 cells that were rendered deficient in autophagy enhanced the invasive capabilities of non-senescent cells. Our results suggest that autophagy modulates the expression of SASP components and, by so doing, affects the behavior of neighboring non-senescent cells. Interestingly, these effects were also influenced by the genetic status of gastric cancer cells.

EWS is a highly aggressive cancer: the overall 5-year survival rate for localized and metastatic EWS are 67 and 38%, respectively. Each year, approximately 200 children and adolescents in the United States are diagnosed with EWS. Genetically, nearly all EWS have chromosomal translocations in which a member of the FET gene family is fused with an ETS transcription factor, with 85% of cases being EWSR1-FLI1. Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) is a serine\/threonine protein kinase involved in transcription elongation through phosphorylation and activation of RNA polymerase II (RPB1) and increases the levels of key oncogenic genes like myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) and c-Myc, which are reported to be involved in chemoresistance. CDK9 may be a viable target in transcriptionally addicted cancers including EWS driven by oncogenic fusion genes like EWSR1-FLI1. TP-1287 is an investigational orally delivered phosphate pro-drug of alvocidib, a potent CDK9 inhibitor. We hypothesized that alvocidib, the pharmaceutically active form of TP-1287, may show activity in EWS cells as a single agent and in combination with standard of care agents. Alvocidib demonstrated the suppression of downstream targets of CDK9 including c-Myc in EWS cell lines after 6-hr treatment. In cell viability assays using CellTiter-Glo, alvocidib resulted in IC<sub>50<\/sub> values of 68 - 125 nM in EWS cell lines after 3-day treatment and 27 - 160 nM in EWS cells from patient derived xenograft (PDX) models, after 6-day treatment. MCL-1 amplified EWS cells were observed significantly more sensitive to alvocidib than MCL-1 diploid EWS cells in the EWS cells from PDX models (p=0.004). Further bioinformatic analysis to predict alvocidib sensitivity is currently underway. Alvocidib demonstrated an additive inhibitory response in combination with topotecan, phosphoramide mustard, a biologically active metabolite of cyclophosphamide, and palifosfamide, a biologically active metabolite of ifosfamide, in EWS cell lines after 3-day treatment. Alvocidib treatment showed reduction of RAD51 which is involved in DNA damage response (DDR), suggesting the activity of alvocidib on DDR may contribute to this additive response. In an <i>in vivo<\/i> preclinical study using the A-673 model, TP-1287 (2.5 mg\/kg, QD) showed tumor growth inhibition (TGI). <i>In vivo<\/i> combination studies with standard of care agents using EWS xenograft models are currently ongoing. In summary, alvocidib has shown activity inhibiting the growth of EWS cells as a single agent and an additive response in combination with EWS standard of care agents in EWS cell lines. TP-1287 may be a potential therapeutic option for the current regimen in EWS. TP-1287 is being investigated for solid tumors including EWS (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03604783).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK inhibitor,Ewing sarcoma,CDK9,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yuta Matsumura<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Richard  E.

We previously demonstrated the efficacy of CDK9 inhibition in reducing the expression of inducible proteins and as a treatment for HCC (Shao et al. Oncology 2022). We thus examined the influence of CDK9 inhibition on the expression of PD-L1 in HCC and the potential of improving the efficacy of PD-1 blockade with the combination of CDK9 inhibitors.<br \/>Methods: We first examined the influence of specific CDK9 inhibitors, AZD4573 and atuveciclib, on interferon-&#947; (IFN-&#947;) induced PD-L1 expression of human HCC cell lines HuH7 and Hep3B. Overexpression of CDK9 and siRNA to CDK9 were used to confirm the findings. Similar experiments were repeated in the mouse HCC cell line BNL. To test the in vivo efficacy, we orthotopically implanted BNL cells in the subcapsular area of BALB\/c mice, which were then treated with vehicle, CDK9 inhibitors, anti-PD-L1 antibodies, or their combination. To compare with tumor sizes, all mice were sacrificed after 14 days of treatment. To compare survival, the mice were only sacrificed if they met the criteria of animal euthanasia.<br \/>Results: Both HuH7 and Hep3B cells had minimal PD-L1 expression, which however could be induced using IFN-&#947;. AZD4573 and atuveciclib decreased the IFN-&#947; induced PD-L1 expression of HuH7 and Hep3B cells in a dose dependent manner. The flow cytometry results confirmed that membrane PD-L1 expression was also decreased by CDK9 inhibition. Overexpression of CDK9 decreased the influence of these CDK9 inhibitors on PD-L1 expression. CDK9 knockdown using siRNA reduced the IFN-&#947; induced PD-L1 expression. AZD4573 and atuveciclib also reduce the PD-L1 expression in BNL cell lines. In the orthotopic animal model, the tumors of the sacrificed mice were significantly smaller in mice treated with atuveciclib and an anti-PD-L1 antibody than mice treatment with either alone. The survival of mice treated with the combination was also longer than mice treated with each therapy alone.<br \/>Conclusion: We demonstrated that CDK9 inhibition could reduce the IFN-&#947; induced PD-L1 expression of HCC cells. Combination of CDK9 inhibitors and anti-PD-L1 antibodies was more effective than either therapy alone.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Hepatocellular carcinoma,PD-L1,CDK inhibitor,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ching-Tso Chen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yu-Yun Shao<sup>2<\/sup>, Hung-Wei Hsu<sup>3<\/sup>, Rita  R.

Despite clinical benefit, safety concerns such as neutropenia and diarrhea, and disease progression, raises a critical need to identify novel therapeutic strategies. Narazaciclib (ON123300), novel CDK4\/6i, designed to enhance efficacy and safety by its multi-targeted kinase inhibitor activity at low nM concentrations against CDK4\/6, ARK5, CSF1R, and c-Kit. Narazaciclib is in Ph I trials; NCT04739293 and CXHL1900340; studying different administration regimens. Since several oncogenic signaling pathways are affected, we examined the efficacy of ON123300 in various breast cancer cell lines, and consolidate its mechanism of action by identifying the other targets engaged by ON123300. To identify direct and secondary targets engaged by narazaciclib and palbociclib, proteome wide Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) was performed. To investigate narazaciclib&#8217;s effect on signaling pathways, Integrative Inferred Kinase Activity (INKA) was performed. Bioinformatics analysis explored the potential clinical effect of the identified targets. Molecular docking simulations investigated the potential interactions of narazaciclib to engage the new targets compared to other CDK4\/6i. Both CETSA and INKA analysis revealed more potential targets engaged by narazaciclib compared to palbociclib in both MDA-MB-231 lysates and intact cells such as BUB1, CHEK1, AURKA, GSK3&#945; and GSK3&#946;. In TNBC patients with BUB1 overexpression bioinformatics analysis indicates a low survival correlation. Docking data showed a higher affinity of narazaciclib with BUB1 compared to palbociclib and abemaciclib. A stronger induction of apoptosis and senescence was detected in narazaciclib treated MMTV-PYMT cells, a murine mammary carcinoma model, compared to the other CDK4\/6i, while narazaciclib enhanced CCL5 and CXCL10 mRNA levels. Reduction of PD-L1 protein levels and a promoting effect on the H2D1 and B2M mRNA levels was perceived in narazaciclib treated PYMT cells. Lastly, inhibition of autophagy, both at the early and late stages, may sensitize cancer cells to narazaciclib and induce irreversible cell proliferation inhibition, providing a novel therapeutic approach. Our data unveiled the differential targets engaged by narazaciclib in comparison to palbociblib. Narazaciclib treatment led to BUB1 protein degradation, overexpression of which is associated with poor prognosis in TNBC. Combination of narazaciclib with autophagy inhibitors sensitized several breast cancer cells to cell death. Narazaciclib treatment may promote antitumor immunity by influencing the expression of various immune modulators in the tumor cells which needs to be further validated in preclinical animal models; and ultimately in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK4\/6 inhibitors,Breast cancer,Molecular targets,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Petros Kechagioglou<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Camille Dupont<sup>1<\/sup>, Hajime Yurugi<sup>1<\/sup>, Ute Distler<sup>1<\/sup>, Stefan Tenzer<sup>1<\/sup>, Alexey Chernobrovkin<sup>2<\/sup>, Kristina Riegel<sup>1<\/sup>, Juliane Mooz<sup>1<\/sup>, Mahil Lambert<sup>3<\/sup>, Volker Dötsch<sup>3<\/sup>, Stephen Cosenza<sup>4<\/sup>, Steven  M.

While tumors initially respond to these therapies, eventually, all therapies fail, and the tumor recurs. Ours and others' recent studies have shown the presence of a universal mechanism of resistance: accession of the polyaneuploid cancer cell (PACC) state. The PolyAneuploid Transition (PAT) is initiated when a cancer cell is subjected to external stress, including therapy (we have tested three classes of chemotherapy and radiation), and accesses an alternative non-mitotic cell cycle known as endocycling, resulting in a greater-than-G2 polyploidization of the aneuploid genome (polyaneuploidy). While in this pro-survival PACC state, we have shown that cells are resistant to all forms of cytotoxic therapy. Initial RNA sequencing of cells that have accessed the PACC state in response to multiple classes of chemotherapy, including docetaxel and cisplatin, demonstrate a remodeled transcriptional profile that is distinct from control cultures. We hypothesize that accession of the resistance-mediating PACC state requires transcriptional remodeling. Our data show that cells in the PACC state had increased overall transcriptional activity. The multi protein complex pTEFB (positive transcription elongation factor) is a critical driver of RNA Polymerase II function and is composed of multiple subunits, including CDK9, a cyclin regulatory subunit, and a transcription factor. CDK9 phosphorylation was significantly elevated during accession and persistence in the PACC state. Genetic inhibitionof CDK9 by siRNA led to decreased expression of cyclin A which plays a role in S phase, both in the mitoticcycle and in the PACC endocycle. Interestingly, despite increased CDK9 levels, known CDK9 pTEFb complex members cyclin T1 and BRD4 were both decreased in cells in the PACC state. We treated cancer cells induced to enter the PACC state upon exposure to cisplatin with pharmaceutical inhibitors of CDK9, Flavopiridol and Fadraciclib. Combination of CDK9 inhibition with chemotherapy showed a suppressive effect on the PACC population. Our findings therefore suggest that a non-canonical CDK9 complex could be critical role for the endocycling to access and maintain the PACC state and represents a therapeutic candidate to eliminate the resistance-mediating PACC state.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Resistance,CDK,Transcriptional regulation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Cheng-fan Lee<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Michael Loycano<sup><\/sup>, Luke LOFTUS<sup><\/sup>, Laurie Kostecka<sup><\/sup>, Melvin Li<sup><\/sup>, Sarah Amend<sup><\/sup>, Kenneth Pienta<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Cancer Ecology Center, The Brady Urological Institute,, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5d9d37a5-e6d6-47f1-9067-e6a9d8f1748b","ControlNumber":"5245","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

But success is limited by development of acquired resistance due to long-term therapy. Cyclin D1 and cyclin dependent kinase 4\/6 (CDK4\/6) complex causes phosphorylation and subsequent inactivation of retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein which promotes progression of the cell cycle from G1 to S phase. This observation led the development of the first CDK4\/6 inhibitor palbociclib (Ibrance; Pfizer) which induces cell cycle arrest at G1 phase in cancer cells. Owing to intrinsic and acquired drug resistance development, success is limited despite promising clinical outcomes. This situation necessitates the development of potential combination strategies to overcome drug resistance. Ribonucleotide reductase (RR) is a rate limiting enzyme in DNA synthesis consisting of two subunits RRM1 and RRM2. Didox inhibits ribonucleotide reductase subunit 2 (RRM2) which ultimately blocks DNA synthesis. Combination of didox with palbociclib is a potential strategy to target ER positive and ER negative\/triple negative breast cancer. Previously, we have shown that didox (DDX) can significantly halt malignant breast cancer cell division in combination with the anthracycline drug doxorubicin by targeting RRM2, mutant p53 and NFkB regulatory proteins. Recently, we confirmed that didox in combination with palbociclib significantly lowers ER positive and ER negative breast cancer and their palbociclib resistant counterparts&#8217; growth compared to no treatment or palbociclib treatment. We also confirmed that ER positive MCF7 and ER negative MDA-MB-468 parental breast cancer cells IC50 of palbociclib drug is lower than their palbociclib resistant counterparts. Here, we are reporting that didox decreases cell cycle proteins alone or in combination with palbociclib in ER positive MCF7 and ER negative MDA-MB-468 parental and palbociclib resistant breast cancer cells. This finding opens a novel approach for targeting both ER positive as well as ER negative breast cancer treatment. We are also reporting that didox treatment modulates cyclin D1 (CCND1) and RRM2 expression in MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer along with their palbociclib resistant counterparts. Additionally, we observed that didox alone or in combination with palbociclib alters the cell cycle of MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 parental and palbociclib resistant breast cancer cells. Our data presents a novel and promising approach for the treatment of ER positive and ER negative breast cancer that involves inhibition of RRM2 and cell cycle that merits further clinical investigation in animal and human models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK4\/6 inhibitors,RRM2 inhibitor,Palbociclib resistance,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Nahid Sultana<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Howard  L.

While CDK4-based monotherapy has been generally ineffective, combinatorial regimens have shown promise. Here we sought to perform an unbiased assessment of potential combinatorial strategies in pre-clinical models of NSCLC.<br \/>Methods: We performed a CRISPR\/Cas9 screen in two NSCLC cell lines (A549 and H2030) in the presence and absence of the CDK4\/6 inhibitor Palbociclib and identified guide RNAs that selectively depleted in the setting of drug treatment. We subsequently performed validation and mechanistic experiments as described. CDK4 and CDK2 activity was assessed using a fluorescent reporter system.<br \/>Results: Palbociclib-sensitizing screen hits include MAPK1 (ERK2), AKT1, MAP3K2 (MEKK2), PIK3CA, MAPK14 (p38a), AKT3, PORCN, LGR4, CDK1, CDK9, and AURKB . Screen results were compared with a previously published Palbociclib sensitizing screen and shared hits were identified. Of these, CCNE1 was the highest scoring hit suggesting relevance across histologies. Interestingly, several screen hits such as ERK2, PIK3CA, VCP and ELAVL1 have reported roles in CCNE1 transcription or post-translational stabilization suggesting a central role for CCNE1 in determining drug sensitivity. Western blot analyses demonstrate that CCNE1 is rapidly upregulated following Palbociclib exposure in a panel of NSCLC cell lines and immunofluorescence shows strong post-treatment CCNE1 expression in human A549 xenografts <i>in vivo<\/i>. CDK2\/4 fluorescent reporter assays show partial restoration of CDK2 activity within 48 hours of Palbociclib treatment. Genetic validation experiments using dox-inducible shRNA constructs targeting CCNE1 show that CCNE1 knockdown sensitizes cells to Palbociclib treatment and enhances senescence induction. Pharmacologic and genetic co-inhibition of CDK2 improves Palbociclib efficacy yet such co-inhibition further elevates CCNE1 levels and CDK2 suppression remains incomplete based the fluorescence reporting system. Furthermore, knockdown of CCNE1 in conjunction with CDK2\/4\/6 inhibition shows improved growth inhibition compared to drug treatment alone. Based on this data, we hypothesize that targeting signaling pathways upstream of CCNE1 transcription or those which affect CCNE1 stabilization and turnover may be more efficacious than combined CDK inhibition.<br \/>Conclusion: CCNE1 is a critical mediator of sensitivity to CDK4\/6 inhibition and Palbociclib treatment results in rapid compensatory increases in CCNE1 levels. Despite drug treatment, NSCLC cells retain CDK2 activity which is only partially inhibited by combined CDK 2\/4\/6 inhibition. Screen results suggest several potential approaches for co-targeting of CCNE1 to enhance drug sensitivity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell cycle,Cyclin E,Lung cancer,CDK inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Matthew Bott<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Maria Skamagki<sup><\/sup>, Nelson Salgado<sup><\/sup>, Francisco Sanchez-Rivera<sup><\/sup>, Scott Lowe<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bf7687e2-ce44-4bee-87d6-e839d977e9d8","ControlNumber":"4936","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

Although this class of inhibitor has been extensively studied in several other cancer types, CDK4\/6 inhibitors have not been approved as a treatment for outside of ER+\/HER2- cancer. We evaluated the clinically approved CDK4\/6 inhibitors, palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib&#8212;in a 500+ cell line screening platform and identified several cancers outside of breast that may have subpopulations that are sensitive to CDK4\/6 inhibitors. Kinome and KiNativ analyses helped identify differences in sensitivity\/selectivity that we observed between each CDK4\/6 inhibitor. Comprehensive molecular profiling of the cell lines at baseline allowed us to screen for potential associations with sensitivity to these compounds. These analyses identified potential biomarkers of sensitivity in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) that will later be evaluated in human clinical studies. Having thoroughly studied the CDK4\/6 class and discovered new opportunities for clinical development, we set out to develop a CDK4\/6 inhibitor that would have the best properties of the two distinguished class members. Using our proprietary chemistry, we developed UCT-03-008, a potent CDK4\/6 small molecular inhibitor with a pharmacology known to enhance therapeutic benefit in mBC. Pharmacokinetic properties of UCT-03-008 are improved over those of other CDK4\/6 inhibitors. UCT-03-008 has activity in preclinical models as a monotherapy and yields <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy in multiple cancer models outside of ER+\/HER2- breast cancer, including CRC and NSCLC. In summary, UCT-03-008 is a CDK4\/6 inhibitor with optimized pharmacological properties. Clinical development of this compound will be guided by the biomarker hypotheses developed here. We are currently enrolling patients for treatment with UCT-03-008 in a Phase 1 clinical trial of advanced solid tumors (NCT05103046).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CDK4\/6 inhibitors,Lung cancer: non-small cell,Colorectal cancer,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Neil A.

CDK2 is hyperactivated in multiple cancers and is therefore an attractive therapeutic target. Here, application of a novel small molecule CDK2\/4\/6 inhibitor, PF-06873600, enabled in-depth interrogation of CDK2 substrate phosphorylation, cell-cycle progression, and drug adaptation in preclinical models. CDK2-specific inhibition leads to rapid loss of substrate phosphorylation, but unexpectedly, CDK2 substrate phosphorylation rebounds within several hours. Whereas CDK1 is known to compensate for loss of CDK2 in Cdk2-\/- mice, here we demonstrate an early dependence on CDK4\/6 activity. CDK2 inhibition reveals latent CDK4\/6 activity throughout S phase that backstops the proliferative program by maintaining Rb1 hyperphosphorylation, active E2F transcription, and Cyclin A2 expression, enabling re-activation of CDK2. Our results augment our understanding of CDK plasticity and indicate that co-inhibition of CDK2 and CDK4\/6 is required to suppress adaptation to CDK2 inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell cycle inhibitors,CDK2,CDK4\/6,Cell cycle,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Mansi Arora<sup>1<\/sup>, Justin Moser<sup>2<\/sup>, Timothy  E.

They can be divided into four entities including atypical lipomatous tumor or well-differentiated LPS (ALT\/WDLPS), dedifferentiated LPS (DDLPS), myxoid LPS (MLPS) and pleomorphic LPS (PLS). Their heterogeneity is reflected in their morphology, molecular landscape, prognosis and clinical behavior. Current treatment options for localized disease include surgery, (neo)adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy; for the metastatic setting chemotherapy represents the cornerstone but its role needs to be elucidated. The unavailability of predictive biomarkers makes the management of these mesenchymal diseases even more challenging. Recent evidences have shed light on the key role of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) in cancer cells proliferation.<br \/>Methods: This study involved 21 adult patients affected by liposarcoma (n= 5 ALT\/WDLPS and n= 16 DDLPS). IHC analyses of CDK4 and MDM2 were performed on FFPE surgically resected specimens by experienced sarcoma pathologists. Moreover, a patient-derived DDLPS cell line was established and pharmacological profiling was performed. Next, standard and innovative drugs currently used for LPS management were assessed in both 2D and 3D culture systems. Finally<i>, in silico<\/i> analyses based on public repositories on STS were carried out including 260 sarcoma patients.<br \/>Results: IHC results highlighted an higher expression of CDK4 and MDM2 biomarkers in DDLPS compared to ALT\/WDLSP. Moreover, although CDK4 and MDM2 are codified by the same genomic region, their expression did not correlate (e.g. 100% of CDK4 and 2% of MDM2 in the same patient). Therefore we hypothesized that even exhibiting a low MDM2 expression, a patient could benefit from CDK4 inhibition. Furthermore, our data showed that in DDLPS cases CDK4 expression ranged from 90% to 100% in spermatic cord, skin and abdomen while it ranged from 5% to 50% in the retroperitoneum. The above observations prompted us to hypothesize a correlation of CDK4 expression with specific anatomical sites. Moreover, pharmacological profiling showed a synergistic effect exerted by sequential treatment with palbociclib and some chemotherapeutics including trabectedin, dacarbazine, eribulin and lenvatinib. Indeed we observed a 10% increase in cell proliferation inhibition compared to standard treatment. In addition, <i>in silico<\/i> analyses revealed the role of CDK4 as negative prognostic biomarker for PFS and OS in STS.<br \/>Conclusions: Our study highlighted the promising role of CDK4 in the management of LPS patients. In particular, we pointed out encouraging results of sequential treatment combining CDK4 inhibitor palbociclib and chemotherapy. Furthermore, preliminary analyses highlighted the involvement of this biomarker as a potential prognostic tool for STS.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,CDK4,Prognostic markers,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Silvia Vanni<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Graziana Gallo<sup>2<\/sup>, Valentina Fausti<sup>3<\/sup>, Giacomo Miserocchi<sup>1<\/sup>, Chiara Liverani<sup>1<\/sup>, Chiara Spadazzi<sup>1<\/sup>, Claudia Cocchi<sup>1<\/sup>, Chiara Calabrese<sup>1<\/sup>, Giovanni De Luca<sup>2<\/sup>, Massimo Bassi<sup>4<\/sup>, Manlio Gessaroli<sup>4<\/sup>, Angelo Campobassi<sup>4<\/sup>, Federica Pieri<sup>5<\/sup>, Giorgio Ercolani<sup>6<\/sup>, Davide Cavaliere<sup>6<\/sup>, Lorena Gurrieri<sup>3<\/sup>, Nada Riva<sup>3<\/sup>, Giovanni Martinelli<sup>7<\/sup>, Laura Mercatali<sup>1<\/sup>, Alessandro De Vita<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Ostencology Unit, Biosciences Laboratory, IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo Per Lo Studio Dei Tumori (IRST) \"Dino Amadori\", Meldola (FC), Italy,<sup>2<\/sup>Pathology Unit, Bufalini Hospital, Cesena (FC), Italy,<sup>3<\/sup>Clinical and Experimental Oncology, Immunotherapy, Rare Cancers and Biological Resource Center, IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo Per Lo Studio Dei Tumori (IRST) \"Dino Amadori\", Meldola (FC), Italy,<sup>4<\/sup>Maxillofacial Surgery Unit, Bufalini Hospital, Cesena (FC), Italy,<sup>5<\/sup>Pathology Unit, Morgagni-Pierantoni Hospital, Forlì (FC), Italy,<sup>6<\/sup>General and Oncologic Surgery, Morgagni-Pierantoni Hospital, Forlì (FC), Italy,<sup>7<\/sup>Scientific Directorate, IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo Per Lo Studio Dei Tumori (IRST) \"Dino Amadori\", Meldola (FC), Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"14197bc0-f3a7-4655-bf87-fd2267e3e872","ControlNumber":"4282","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Uncontrolled cellular proliferation is a hallmark of cancer commonly driven by dysregulated kinase activity of specific CDK family members, including cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). Aberrant CDK2 activity most frequently occurs through amplification of CCNE1 and\/or overexpression of its protein product cyclin E1, which is a canonical binding partner of CDK2. Overexpression of cyclin E1 is observed in many solid tumors including in patients with high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), gastric cancer, and ER-positive breast cancer patients whose tumors have progressed on a prior CDK4\/6 inhibitor regimen. Selective inhibition of CDK2 is thus a compelling therapeutic approach to regain cell cycle control. Here, we report preclinical data supporting the development of INX-315 for patients with cancers in which proliferation is CDK2-dependent. INX-315 is a potent inhibitor of CDK2\/cyclin E (0.6 nM biochemical IC50) with high selectivity over other CDK family members in both biochemical and intracellular NanoBRET assays. In CCNE1-amplified human ovarian and gastric cancer cell lines, INX-315 potently inhibited Rb phosphorylation, induced a G1 cell cycle arrest, and inhibited proliferation. INX-315 also showed potent anti-proliferative activity in luminal breast cancer cell lines that had been cultured in CDK4\/6 inhibitor (+\/- anti-estrogen therapy) for prolonged periods to the point of developing drug resistance. While these cell lines did not readily respond to either CDK4\/6 or CDK2 inhibition alone, combination treatment again suppressed Rb phosphorylation, accompanied by G1 arrest and a senescent-like phenotype. Lastly, in CCNE1-amplified xenograft models of ovarian and gastric carcinomas, INX-315 inhibited Rb-phosphorylation and induced tumor regression. These data demonstrate INX-315 to be a potent and selective CDK2 inhibitor that may benefit patients with CDK2\/cyclin E driven cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB01-01 CDKs and CDK inhibitors,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Novel anticancer agents,CDK inhibitor,Breast cancer,Cyclin E,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alec  G.
