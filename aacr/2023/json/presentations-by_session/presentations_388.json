[{"Abstract":"Rationale: BRAF mutations leading to aberrant MAPK\/ERK signaling are one of the major driver mutations in low-grade pediatric brain tumors (e.g., pilocytic astrocytoma, ganglioglioma, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor, and diffuse astrocytoma). These variants are highly associated with poor prognosis and intractable epilepsy. We previously identified that BRAF mutations originate from neural stem cells during embryonic brain development and lead to epilepsy-associated pediatric brain tumors (Koh et al, Nat Med 2018). Existing BRAF inhibitors such as Vemurafenib and Dabrafenib are specific to BRAF V600E protein<i> <\/i>and have limited penetrance into the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapy via intrathecal injection bypasses BBB and degrades the transcript of the target gene in the brain. Thus, it is a promising and effective therapeutic tool in neurological disorders with genetically and molecularly identified targets.<br \/>Methods: We developed the genetically engineered mouse model of Braf-derived pediatric brain tumors with intractable epilepsy by introducing<i> <\/i>Braf p.V600E mutation into neural stem cells during embryonic brain development. These mice show a gradual increase in tumor size and epileptic seizures and a decrease in survival rate over time, thereby recapitulating BRAF-derived pediatric brain tumors with intractable epilepsy. We administrated the most effective ASO inhibiting mouse Braf RNA selected by <i>in silico<\/i> and <i>in vitro<\/i> screening. ASO was delivered by single bolus intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection at 10 weeks after pre-monitoring of behavior seizure and tumor size.<br \/>Results: Oral administration of existing BRAF inhibitors could not significantly reduce seizures and tumor size in BRAF pediatric tumor models. Single ICV injection of Braf ASO successfully reduced the transcript and encoded protein in a dose-dependent manner and its knock-down effect lasted at least 3 months. Injected ASOs are well distributed to CD34-positive regions and tumor cells in Braf-derived neuro-glial tumors. The behavioral and electrographic seizure frequency is remarkably reduced after treatment of the ASO. The size of tumors and enlarged dysmorphic neurons are significantly reduced. The survival rate was significantly increased. Also, the bodyweight is rescued in Braf ASO treated group, compared to the vehicle-treated control group. No behavioral and molecular toxicity was found at two months after i.c.v. administration of ASO.<br \/>Conclusions: In our study,<b> <\/b>ASO therapy targeting BRAF shows strong therapeutic effects on various aspects of BRAF-derived pediatric brain tumors, including the epileptic seizures, tumor size, survival rate as well as dysmorphic neurons. Therefore, ASO therapy targeting BRAF will be a promising and effect therapy in BRAF-derived pediatric brain tumors with intractable epilepsy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-01 Antisense molecules,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,BRAF,Antisense oligonucleotides,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jeong Ho Lee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Seyeon Kim<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology\/Sovargen, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"04fd4832-f2c2-4349-bc5c-c2b7d5a1cf8d","ControlNumber":"4088","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

However, durable clinical responses conferred by immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors are experienced in only a minority of patients, in part because these therapies fail to sufficiently activate and recruit T cells into the tumor. Therapeutic use of cytokines to potently stimulate tumor-reactive T cells have shown great promise in treating solid tumors but a narrow therapeutic index has precluded their development in the clinic. To overcome these limitations, we developed STX-001, a multi-modal synthetic self-replicating mRNA technology that delivers a prolonged and locally-acting IL-12 cytokine to the tumor microenvironment. STX-001, when delivered directly to the tumor, induces a highly immunogenic tumor cell death&nbsp;while the mRNA-encoded IL-12 payload promotes recruitment of effector T cells and NK cells into the tumor microenvironment. The self-replicating nature of STX-001 enables delivery of&nbsp;therapeutic quantities&nbsp;of IL-12 at dose levels that are orders of magnitude lower than conventional mRNA. STX-001 produces&nbsp;IL-12 upon intratumoral delivery to patient-derived xenografts and the IL-12 payload encoded in STX-001 exhibits similar activity to native IL-12. Using a murine surrogate, a single dose of STX-001 induces deep anti-tumor responses, eradicating tumors in multiple murine models, and promoting responses that are durable against subsequent rechallenge. Furthermore, intratumoral delivery of a single dose of STX-001 controls the growth of distal untreated tumors suggesting capability of promoting systemic immune responses or abscopal effects. Lastly, combination of STX-001 with PD-1\/PD-L1 axis inhibitors further enhances efficacy in PD-1 refractory preclinical models. Taken together, our preclinical data demonstrates that STX-001 has potential to overcome limitations of current immunotherapy approaches to improve clinical responses to solid tumors.&nbsp;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Immune modulators,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cytokines,mRNA,Solid tumors,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ryan T.

Linear mRNA approaches have failed clinically in this technological use case due to low levels of protein expression and poor durability. Self-replicating RNA (srRNA) is a new technology for expression of biotherapeutics combining the advantages of fully synthetic drug products with higher peak levels of protein expression with active expression persisting out to 49 days. RBI-2000 is a novel srRNA encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle and encoding two distinct proteins on the same strand of RNA. The first protein is a pro-inflammatory multimeric cytokine to promote <i>de novo<\/i> immune cell generation and infiltration. The second molecule is a single chain high affinity protein antagonist of downstream mediators of the inflammasome to prevent sterile inflammation, aberrant angiogenesis, and tumor invasiveness. We selected a novel alphaviral vector which demonstrated an enhanced peak level of protein expression vs. the prototypical vector that has been used in other RNA products. These encoded proteins elicited a pharmacodynamic response that had no evidence of decay in the first 7 days following a single treatment down to doses of 0.01 mcg. Using an implanted MC38 tumor model, tumor control was obtained at the lowest, single dose tested at 0.1 mcg of RBI-2000. When tested in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor (CPI), a single dose of the CPI and a single dose of RBI-2000 at 10 mcg resulted in 80% tumor control in the mice (8\/10 mice). Tumor re-challenge of the mice at a site distal to the original implantation showed 100% protection. Collectively, these data demonstrate the feasibility of novel srRNA vectors as a protein drug replacement approach including for the expression of complex, multimeric cocktails of proteins.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-04 Vector systems and targeting strategies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Protein expression,RNA,Cytokines,Immunocytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zelanna Goldberg<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Christian Maine<sup><\/sup>, Gabrielle  P.

Elevated TYMS levels are frequently observed in human PanNET and are associated with worse prognosis and resistance to cytotoxic agents such as 5FU. Elevated TYMS levels directly promote tumorigenesis <i>in vitro<\/i> and ectopic expression of human TS (hTS) in transgenic mice promotes adenoma development in the endocrine pancreas <i>in vivo<\/i>. Pancreatic islet tumor formation in hTS transgenic mice occurred with a long latency period, suggesting that additional somatic events are required for PanNET formation and progression. Men1 was shown to be a frequent target for somatic mutation in PanNETs (44% have MEN1 mutations). Therefore, we established a new mouse model designated <i>hTS\/Men1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i>, where hTS is overexpressed in pancreatic islet cells carrying conditional <i>Men1<\/i> null alleles. We observed that ectopic hTS cooperates with <i>Men1<\/i> inactivation to significantly accelerate PanNET progression and shorten survival. Since traditional TYMS inhibitors, such as 5-FU, consistently induce tumor resistance and cannot cure advanced disease, we have now tested the ability of TS-shRNA delivered using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors as a pharmacological safe and effective anti-tumor strategy. We packaged TS shRNA under the mouse insulin promoter (mIP) for islet-cell specific expression using capsid optimized Y to F double mutant AAV (AAV8-2M) to generate viral particles of scAAV8-2M-mIP-GFP-hTS-shRNA. We treated <i>hTS\/Men1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice with intraperitoneal (IP) injection (1x10<sup>11<\/sup> viral genomes\/mice). Treated and control mice were analyzed for PanNET progression, TYMS expression and survival. In addition, we tested a human PanNET tumor cell line (BON) that was isogenic with or without hTS expression for tumor formation in xenograft model. We confirmed sustained reduction of TYMS levels 3 weeks after IP delivery of AA8-2M-mIP-GFP-hTS-shRNA into PanNET tissues of <i>hTS\/Men1<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice. In addition, AA8-2M-mIP-GFP-hTS-shRNA delivery blocked PanNET tumor progression and enhanced the survival of treated mice as compared to vector controls. We also confirmed that TYMS knock-down in BON cells by hTS-shRNA reduced xenograft tumor growth as compared to non-specific shRNA controls. In conclusion, the ability of AAV-mediated TS shRNA to block PanNET tumor progression directly demonstrates the importance of elevated TYMS in tumorigenesis and offers a novel anti-cancer strategy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-01 Antisense molecules,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene therapy,Transgenic mouse models,Thymidylate Synthase ,Neuroendocrine tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Vinod Vijayakurup<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Benjamin Meyer<sup><\/sup>, Akbar Nawab<sup><\/sup>, Frederic J.

We have generated a CD8-targeted fusosome to deliver a CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) transgene to CD8+ T cells <i>in vivo<\/i> following intravenous (i.v.) injection. Although fusosomes are capable of genetically modifying resting T cells, modulation with chemical or biological agents may increase transduction and facilitate CAR T expansion. Here, we demonstrate that rapamycin and IL-7 enhance resting T cell transduction, and IL-7 supports the expansion of <i>in vivo<\/i> generated CAR T cells to increase anti-tumor efficacy.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> CD8a-targeted fusosome encoding GFP or CD19CAR transgene were generated. To measure the effect on transduction, T cells were pre-treated with IL-7 (15 ng\/ml) or rapamycin (30 &#956;M) prior to fusosome exposure. Transduction was assessed by flow cytometry and vector copy number after 7-10 days in culture. CAR T cell function and expansion were assessed in coculture assays with CD19+ Nalm6 tumor cells using live cell imaging. To measure anti-tumor efficacy with a combined fusosome and IL-7 approach, immunodeficient NSG mice were challenged i.v. with Nalm6 tumors expressing firefly luciferase (5E5 cells\/mouse) on day -4, PBMC (1E7 cells\/mouse) on day -1 followed by CD8\/CD19CAR fusosome (1E7 IU\/mouse) on day 0. IL-7 (1-5 &#956;g\/mouse) was administered subcutaneously twice weekly. Tumor growth was monitored by bioluminescence imaging.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> CD8\/CD19CAR fusosome were effective at transducing resting T cells. Pre-treatment with IL-7 alone resulted in a moderate increase in transduction efficiency (1.5x). In contrast, pre-treatment with both IL-7 and rapamycin further increased transduction efficiency (&#62;5x). As IL-7 could also be used to support CAR T expansion, we tested whether IL-7 post-fusosome exposure could increase CAR T cell numbers and anti-tumor efficacy. In the absence of tumor targets, IL-7 promoted the expansion of CD8+ CAR T cells as well as non-transduced T cells. However, in the presence of tumor antigen, IL-7 treatment resulted in selective expansion of CAR T cells over bystander T cells (40x vs 10x, respectively) <i>in vitro<\/i>. Importantly, systemic IL-7 treatment following CD8\/CD19CAR fusosome administration increased efficacy in Nalm6 tumor bearing NSG mice compared to those treated with fusosome only.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> T cell-targeted fusosomes encoding a CAR transgene potentially represent a novel, off-the-shelf therapeutic approach for cancer. This study demonstrates that modulation of the resting T cell state can increase susceptibility to fusosome-mediated transduction.

Therapies utilizing autologous CAR T cells have demonstrated success using the murine CD19-specific scFv, FMC63. These murine sequences have the potential to incite T cell and antibody responses against the CAR, which may play a role in CAR T cell elimination. This scenario increases in likelihood in the context of <i>in vivo<\/i> CAR delivery, where immunosuppression via lymphodepletion is not required. To reduce the potential for CAR-specific immunogenicity, we developed a novel, fully human CD19-specific CAR for use with our <i>in vivo<\/i> delivery platform.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>For efficacy-based screening of human CD19 binders, healthy donor T cells were transduced with VSV-g pseudotyped lentivirus containing second-generation fully human CD19 CARs. FMC63 CARs were produced in a similar fashion and used as benchmark controls for initial characterization studies. CD8-targeted fusogen was generated through targeted mutation to ablate binding to its native receptor. This &#8220;blinded&#8221; fusogen was subsequently engineered to display a novel scFv that is specific for human CD8&#945;. VV encoding either FMC63 or human CD19 CARs were pseudotyped with CD8-specific fusogen to produce CD8-targeted fusosomes. CD19 CAR efficacy was analyzed <i>in vitro<\/i> via luciferase assays against NALM-6 or CD19KO NALM-6 tumor lines.

In order to restore antitumor immunity subverted by tumor cells, we evaluated in this study intraperitoneal administration of vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) genetically modified to express the proinflammatory cytokine single-chain interleukin 12. MVA encoding scIL-12 was evaluated in peritoneal carcinomatosis models based on intraperitoneal administration of tumor cells. The immune response was evaluated by ELISpot, flow cytometry, intravital microscopy, and depleting monoclonal antibodies. Safety was assessed by measuring body weight and a hemogram test. Tissue tropism after intravenous or intraperitoneal administration was determined by bioluminescence analysis after the administration of MVA encoding luciferase.<br \/>Intraperitoneal or locoregional administration, but not other routes of administration, elicited a potent immune response characterized by increased levels of tumor-specific T CD8 lymphocytes. The antitumor immune response was detectable not only in the peritoneal cavity but also systemically. As a result, a single intraperitoneal administration of MVA encoding scIL-12 completely eradicates MC38 cells implanted in the peritoneum, protecting cured mice from a subcutaneous rechallenge with MC38 cells. The safety profile of intraperitoneal administration was also superior to that of intravenous administration since there was no weight loss or hematological toxicity when the vector was infused into the peritoneal cavity.<br \/>In conclusion, intraperitoneal administration of MVA vectors encoding scIL-12 induces a potent tumor-specific immune response that leads to the eradication of peritoneal metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Immune modulators,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Vaccinia virus,Peritoneal metastasis,Interleukin-12,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"√Ångela Bella<sup>1<\/sup>, Leire Arrizabalaga<sup>1<\/sup>, Claudia Augusta Di Trani<sup>1<\/sup>, Jos√© Gonz√°lez-Gomariz<sup>1<\/sup>, Assunta Cirella<sup>1<\/sup>, Irene Olivera<sup>1<\/sup>, Maite Alvarez<sup>1<\/sup>, √Ålvaro Teijeira<sup>1<\/sup>, Cigdem Atay Langbein<sup>2<\/sup>, Jos√© Medina-Echeverz<sup>2<\/sup>, Maria Hinterberger<sup>2<\/sup>, Hubertus Hochrein<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Ignacio Melero<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Pedro Berraondo<sup>1<\/sup>, Fernando Aranda<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Immunology & Immunotherapy, Cima University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain,<sup>2<\/sup>Bavarian nordic GmbH, Martinsried, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e2d1569a-a159-43a8-9960-300fd1c82aeb","ControlNumber":"3473","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>√Å.

Immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICBT) has emerged as a powerful new tool for cancer therapy. However, only CRCs associated with microsatellite instability (MSI) or DNA mismatch repair gene defects (dMMR, ~15% of all CRCs) are sensitive to this therapy. This poor sensitivity to ICBT is either due to poor tumor infiltration of functional T cells or T cell exhaustion. To overcome this, we investigated a combination treatment with an oncolytic virus and an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI). Because tumor cell oncolysis generates neoantigens and increases tumor immunogenicity, T cell infiltration into the tumor tissue will be increased and the efficacy of ICBT will be enhanced. Accordingly, local immune checkpoint inhibition coupled with oncolysis may be an ideal ICBT. In the present study, a novel peptide that interferes with the PD-1\/PD-L1 immune checkpoint pathway, termed PD-L1 inhibitory peptide 3 (PD-L1ip3), was computationally designed, experimentally validated for its specific binding to PD-L1, and evaluated for its antitumor effects in cell culture and in a mouse colon carcinoma syngeneic murine model. Fourteen candidate peptide sequences were generated using the PinaColada algorithm and the x-ray structure of the PD-1:PD-L1 complex and screened in molecular dynamics simulations on the microsecond timescale. Two were chosen for experimental testing, wherein the peptide denoted PD-L1ip3 showed a binding affinity for PD-L1 in the micromolar range. In cell culture studies, treatment with PD-L1ip3, but not a similar peptide with a scrambled sequence, substantially increased death of CT26 colon carcinoma cells when co-cultured with murine CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells primed by antigens from CT26 cells. In immunocompetent mice, growth of CT26 tumor cells transduced with the PD-L1ip3 gene by an adenovirus vector was significantly slower than that of un-transduced CT26 cells. This tumor growth attenuation was further enhanced by cotreatment with the peptide form of PD-L1ip3. The present study suggests that this peptide can stimulate host antitumor immunity <i>via<\/i> a blockade of the PD-1\/PD-L1 pathway, thereby increasing CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell-induced death of colon carcinoma cells. The tumor site-specific inhibition of PD-L1 by an adenovirus carrying the PD-L1ip3 gene, together with direct peptide treatment, may be used as a local immune checkpoint blockade therapy to inhibit colon carcinoma growth.

Peritoneal dissemination represents a critical first step in EOC progression, and we posit that genetic modification of mesothelial cells with full length membrane-bound TRAIL is a practical approach to intervention and will provide local control of EOC progression. Here, we stably overexpressed full length tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) with a lentiviral vector in the immortalized mesothelial cell line, MeT5A. Overexpression of TRAIL on the cell surface of MeT5A was confirmed by flow cytometry, and no obvious changes in proliferation or morphology were observed when MeT5A\/TRAIL cells were grown in culture. In co-culture experiments, however, MeT5A\/TRAIL cells induced apoptosis of surrounding cancer cells and continued proliferating until the culture surface was confluent with mesothelial cells alone. Interestingly, MeT5A\/TRAIL not only induced cell death of TRAIL-sensitive cancer cells, such as OVCAR3 and H460, but it also induced significant apoptosis of cancer cells previously deemed resistant to soluble TRAIL, such as A2780, and OVCAR8. This finding suggests that full length TRAIL (amino acid 1-281) expressed on the cell surface is capable of activating death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathways that are not reactive to the soluble form of TRAIL (amino acid 114-281), which was previously developed as a cancer therapeutic and thoroughly evaluated in animal models and clinical trials. When co-cultured with MeT5A\/TRAIL, primary ovarian cancer cells from patients also underwent apoptosis as detected by flow cytometry and the upregulation of cleaved caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, PARP, and Bid on Western blots. Next, we assessed the anticancer potential of mesothelial cells expressing membrane-bound TRAIL in a NSG xenograft mouse model of ovarian cancer. Intraperitoneal inoculation of MeT5A\/TRAIL cells significantly reduced overall cancer burden in mice where OVCAR3, A2780, and OVCAR8 cancer cells were pre-established. Intraperitoneal gene delivery of TRAIL to resident peritoneal mesothelial cells utilizing a conditionally replicative adenovirus vector also prolonged survival of NSG mice bearing A2780 xenografts. Our data suggest that genetic modification of mesothelial cells with full length membrane-bound TRAIL is feasible and has therapeutic potential for disrupting EOC progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-04 Vector systems and targeting strategies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Adenovirus,MUC16,TRAIL,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Er Yue<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Tonya Walser<sup><\/sup>, Tamara Mirzapoiazova<sup><\/sup>, Ravi Salgia<sup><\/sup>, Edward W.

The Tumor Specific Immunogene (T-SIGn) platform is designed to generate vectors that can express combinations of transgenes producing immunotherapeutics selectively within the tumor microenvironment. T-SIGn is clinically validated for intravenous delivery, enabling the vectors to reach primary and metastatic sites to replicate and produce their therapeutic transgene payloads specifically in malignant epithelial cells. Transgene (TG) cassettes of T-SIGn vectors can be up to approximately 3.5Kb, allowing the expression of multiple distinct TGs. NG-350A is a clinical stage T-SIGn vector, with an established safety\/tolerability profile, that expresses a full-length agonist CD40 antibody, and shows evidence of target engagement and adaptive immune activation in patients with different epithelial solid tumors via prolonged, dose-dependent increases in IL-12p70, IFN&#947; and IL-17A detected in the circulation of patients about 2 weeks after the initiation of the day 1, 3, 5 dosing regimen. NG-350A is currently being evaluated in phase I clinical studies in combination with Pembrolizumab or Ipilimumab. We have been characterizing numerous smaller fragment antibody formats that enable us to combine their expression with other antibody fragments or immunomodulatory molecules as a T-SIGn vector. An ScFv anti-CD40 fragment antibody design was identified as a potent immunotherapeutic to induce the secretion of IL-12p70 cytokine following stimulation of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells, as well as an enhanced antigen-specific T-cell activation and macrophage conversion to a more pro-inflammatory phenotype. When encoded together with CXCL9 and other immunostimulatory cytokines, the anti-CD40 ScFv has been selected as a potential follow-up to NG-350A that synergistically drives enhanced <i>in vitro<\/i> T-cell priming, activation and migration. Other checkpoint inhibitor and coactivator antibodies, as both ScFv and camelid VHH formats, have also been encoded individually, in combination with the anti-CD40 antibody fragment or other fragment antibodies to create a set of viral vectors that are being evaluated preclinically as future T-SIGn vector candidates. Data from these studies with initial vectors encoding combinations of functionally active antibody fragments will be presented. Collectively, these clinical and preclinical datasets demonstrate the broad utility of the T-SIGn platform for expressing rationally-designed combinations of antibodies and other natural and synthetic agents within tumors and thus enabling the development of new and potent immunotherapies for patients with solid epithelial cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Immune modulators,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene therapy,Immunotherapy,Tumor microenvironment,Antibody engineering,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Rachel Bergin<sup><\/sup>, Amandine Pelletier<sup><\/sup>, Manuela Zonca<sup><\/sup>, Alice Muntzer<sup><\/sup>, Meg Snowden<sup><\/sup>, Samuel Hardy<sup><\/sup>, Carla Cerqueira<sup><\/sup>, Tae Hyun-Jang<sup><\/sup>, Rochelle Lear<sup><\/sup>, Masumi Fujinobu<sup><\/sup>, Maria Stella Sasso<sup><\/sup>, <b>Samantha Bucktrout<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Brian  R.

Innate &#38; adaptive immunological responses in females are known to be relatively superior to males. However, the development of NPs and therapeutic devices generally lacks attention to the impact of sex on therapeutic outcomes. Herein, we evaluated the role of sexual dimorphism in the immune-mediated remission of murine head &#38; neck (MOC2) tumors following in-situ therapy with immunogenic cell death-enhancing calreticulin nanoparticle (CRT-NP) and focused ultrasound-based histotripsy (HT). CRT-NP was synthesized with DOTAP and cholesterol lipids using the thin film and extrusion methodology and loaded with a full-length clone CRT-expressing vector. CRT-NP was characterized for size and &#918; potential (ZP) using dynamic light scattering. To assess in vivo efficacy, male &#38; female mice bearing MOC2 tumor xenografts were randomized into the following groups (n=6mice\/group)&#166; 1) Control, 2) CRT-NP, &#38; 3) HT. Three intratumoral CRT-NP injections (20&#181;g CRT-DNA\/injection) were given 2 days apart 7-days post-inoculation. For comparing gender-mediated tumor immunomodulation, two local HT treatments were similarly administered in male &#38; female MOC2 cohorts. Mice were sacrificed on day 20-post inoculation &#38; the tumors, tumor-draining lymph nodes, spleen, &#38; serum were processed for assessing inflammatory signatures using flow cytometry, &#38; cytokine analysis. CRT-NPs demonstrated a hydrodynamic diameter of &#8776;260nm, &#918;P of +17mv &#38; a PDI &#8804;0.3. Compared to the untreated controls that showed a pronounced increase in tumor volumes, male &#38; female mice treated with CRT-NP showed a &#8776;65% reduction in tumor growth post-treatment. HT treatment of female mice similarly suppressed the MOC2 tumor growth rates &#8776;64% vs. corresponding untreated control, however, it was ineffective in inducing remission of male mice tumors. The reduced HT efficacy in male mice correlated with increased infiltration of immunosuppressive NK+PD1+ cells &#38; CD11b+PDL1+ macrophage in tumors. In contrast, the improved efficacy in female mice with both CRT and HT treatments associated with increased infiltration of CD4+ cells, CD8+ cells, NK cells, macrophage (CD11b+CD86+MHCII+), &#38; a reduction in the M-MDSC population in the treated tumors. An additional correlation of local immune cell immunomodulation with systemic serum cytokine responses is currently in the works. CRT-NP was effective in both male &#38; female mice. HT-induced tumor remission in females, but male mice demonstrate immunoresistance. These suggest that immunomodulatory therapies should account for sexual dimorphism as a variable. A higher accumulation of immunosuppressive cells in male TME can impact the anti-tumor immunity of immunomodulatory therapies in preclinical and clinical settings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-03 Immune modulators,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Gender,Nanoparticle,Focused Ultrasound,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sri Vidhya Chandrasekar<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Akansha Singh<sup><\/sup>, Ashish Ranjan<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Physiological sciences, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b58ffe24-c3c6-484e-9989-3b2cc051aa67","ControlNumber":"7676","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

TNBC accounts for 10-20% of all cancer cases and is more aggressive than other subtypes of breast cancer. Although chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for TNBC, its therapeutic efficacy is limited. Therefore, developing new therapies to address the unmet need of TNBC is urgently needed.<br \/>CD24 protein is a heavily glycosylated glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored surface protein. The high expression level of CD24 is observed in a variety of cancers, such as TNBC and ovarian cancer. CD24 plays an important role in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis of different types of cancers. Besides, overexpression of CD24 in tumors is associated with resistance to chemotherapy agents and targeted therapies.<br \/>Here, we design four siRNAs targeting different regions of the CD24 mRNA. The silencing activity of the predesigned siRNAs is evaluated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and western blot. The biological effects of designed siRNAs on human breast cancer cells are investigated by cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. The data demonstrate that the CD24 siRNAs significantly reduce CD24 expressions at both mRNA level and protein level in human TNBC cells. Moreover, silencing of CD24 suppresses breast cancer cell proliferation. Cell cycle assay shows that the anti-proliferation effect of CD24 siRNA is mediated by arresting the cells in the S phase. Furthermore, we reveal that silencing of CD24 inhibits migration and invasion of human breast cancer cells. Significant apoptosis is observed in CD24 siRNA transfected cells compared with the scrambled siRNA group. These data suggest that silencing CD24 using siRNA can be a potential therapeutic strategy for triple-negative breast cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET04-01 Antisense molecules,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"siRNA,CD24,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yanli Liu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kun Cheng<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Missouri - Kansas City, Kansas City, MO","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2197a6af-e61c-4b47-842d-975b8ba51bd8","ControlNumber":"3742","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

However, the clinical development of Telomelysin may be hindered by human antiviral immunity and tumor resistance. Combining oncolytic and epigenetic therapies has been reported to be a viable approach for treating various cancers. We investigated the potential synergism of Telomelysin and AR42 and the relevant underlying mechanisms.<br \/><b><u>Method:<\/u> <\/b>HCC cell lines (PLC5 and Hep3B) were tested and median effect analysis was performed to estimate potential synergistic antiproliferative effects. Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry and Western blotting. The expression of coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) was measured through flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (<i>hTERT<\/i>) mRNA expression was assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Western blotting was conducted to examine the activation of pivotal signaling pathways and the interferon (IFN) response. HCC cells constitutively overexpressing Akt were cloned for molecular mechanism verification. MK-2206 was used to inhibit the activation of Akt signaling. <i>In vivo <\/i>efficacy was determined through xenograft<br \/>models of human HCC.<br \/><b><u>Results:<\/u> <\/b>Telomelysin and AR42 exhibited synergistic antiproliferative effects in human HCC models<i> in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Apoptosis induced by Telomelysin was significantly enhanced by AR42 in both PLC5 and Hep3B HCC cells. AR42 treatment unexpectedly attenuated the expression of the CAR and the mRNA levels of <i>hTERT<\/i>, which may be positively associated with the cytotoxicity of Telomelysin. Meanwhile, the cellular antiviral interferon response was not altered by AR42 treatment. Further, we found that Telomelysin enhanced Akt phosphorylation in HCC cells. AR42 reduced Telomelysin-induced phospho-Akt activation and enhanced Telomelysin-induced apoptosis. The correlation of Akt phosphorylation with drug-induced apoptosis was validated in HCC cells with upregulated or downregulated Akt signaling.<br \/><b><u>Conclusions:<\/u> <\/b>Combination therapy with Telomelysin and AR42 demonstrates synergistic anti-HCC efficacy.
