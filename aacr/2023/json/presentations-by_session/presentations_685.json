The incidence rate of colorectal cancer is rising by about 2% annually in young people. By 2030, researchers predict that colorectal cancer will be the leading cause of cancer related deaths in people age 20-49. Young-onset CRC patients and survivors face unique challenges. Traditionally, their concerns have been unmet by personal and medical networks. The Colorectal Cancer Alliance created the Never Too Young Advisory Board to help advocate for research and educational advances in this area while offering meaningful support and community. <b>Methods:<\/b> Staff members at the Alliance collect data on volunteer roles, hours, and participants. Using this data, we analyzed and compared the number of volunteers, volunteer hours, and engagement rates for the Never Too Young Advisory Board. Data collected was compared to previous years to assess the impact of the Never Too Young Advisory Board. <b>Results:<\/b> Never Too Young (N2Y) Advisory Board March earned media campaign to raise awareness and needs of the increasing number of individuals diagnosed with CRC under 50 continues to increase year after year. There has been an increase in volunteers involved show in 2018 the # of volunteers being 35 &#38; volunteers hours 824 to 2021 the # of volunteers was 45 &#38; volunteer hours increased to 2362. These numbers helped increase all campaigns we participated in. Operation Blue Boxes, a campaign to spread awareness with news anchors across the US started with 37 anchors across the country wearing a CRC awareness pin and sharing information about CRC to their viewers and in 2022 resulted in 41 media interviews resulting in 151 media hits and 8.6 million impressions. Other growth has been shown during Young Survivors week where N2Y members had over 170,742 impressions on social media, our Facebook frame was used 105 times and there was an increase in N2Y BST (?) by $ 23,372 in 2022. Other things to note is that survivors from N2Y have been involved in Scientific abstracts at AACR and the Fight CRC Symposium and speakers\/panelists at AACR, the Global Colon Cancer Association, CRRAN, EAO-CRC, and Colon Cancer 101, and reviewers for the Department of Defense. <b>Conclusion: <\/b>Keeping in mind the number from 2030 our goal is to prevent colorectal cancer from becoming the leading cause of cancer related deaths in people age 20-49. Through increased volunteers and hours, social media outreach, fundraising, and serving the research community in various ways we hope to increase awareness and educate others about this screenable cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Allison Rosen<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

One of the main programs of the organization is the cancer navigation service which is designed to meet the needs of persons diagnosed with cancer and their family members. The service offers support, education and guidance through the cancer journey. Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally (World Health Organization), accounting for approximately 10 million deaths annually. In Trinidad and Tobago, these cancer incidence and mortality trends are similarly mirrored (Warner et al.). For the year 2020, there were an approximate 3,919 incident cases in Trinidad and Tobago, with 2,239 deaths associated with the disease (GLOBOCAN). The burden of the disease continues to grow, increasing the associated impact on healthcare systems. The leading causes of cancer deaths in the Caribbean can be reduced through prevention, screening, early detection, and effective treatment. The educational component of the Navigation Program has evolved over the past five years, from being an in-person programme to becoming a virtual education program which how extends it reach through the Caribbean. We aim to empower patients with education and support to become self- advocates. Patients are then more likely to adhere to their treatment plan. The navigation service engages with patients to identify barriers they are facing on their treatment journey. The benefit is reducing the barriers that the patient faces to bring them the best possible outcome. The current aim and focus will be navigation of younger women,50 and under and tending to their specific barriers, a couple examples of these will be demonstrated via the poster.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nalisha Monroe<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

This is a recent project from PALTOWN, a nonprofit that builds online communities for patients and caregivers, provides community leadership training for patient and caregiver volunteers, and works to educate community members about treatment options and clinical trials. COLONTOWN is PALTOWN&#8217; first online disease community, serving more than 8,500 colorectal cancer patients and caregivers.<br \/>CTU is a virtual colorectal cancer education resource for patients and caregivers. This poster describes the process by which we create structured, high-quality content around topics and questions that are often discussed in the 120 &#8220;neighborhoods&#8221; of our Facebook community, COLONTOWN (CT). A large majority of CT members are young and late stage - many arrive in CT newly diagnosed. CTU&#8217;s multimedia resource libraries, or Learning Centers, are informed at every level by the thousands of conversations in COLONTOWN; conversations that reflect not only what patients and caregivers need to know about their disease, but how they learn, what their anxieties are, and how they traverse the information landscape that they have been thrust into.<br \/>This patient-centric approach has led us to develop 3 distinct content models exemplified by these Learning Centers: 1) The Lecture Hall 2) Diagnostic &#38; Surveillance Test Learning Center &#38; Featured Trials and 3) CRC101. The poster describes how these content models engage patients, caregivers, and other stakeholders to produce accessible and useful resources addressing many aspects of the CRC patient experience. User surveys from the first year of the project demonstrate high levels of satisfaction and confidence in CTU offerings. The project is staffed by a Content team comprising a science editor with web design experience, a stage IV patient, a stage IV caregiver and the Scientific Director, who is also a CRC survivor. Our goal is to create engaging, informative and actionable content for CRC patients and caregivers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Manju George<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

While the exact causes of hepatoblastoma are not yet fully understood, research has revealed some potential genetic and environmental factors that may contribute to its development. One area of ongoing research in the field is the study of the genomic characteristics of hepatoblastoma, using techniques such as genome sequencing to identify mutations and other genetic changes that may be involved in the cancer's development. Genome sequencing is a powerful tool for studying the genetic basis of cancer, as it allows researchers to identify specific mutations and other changes in the DNA of tumor cells. In the case of hepatoblastoma, genome sequencing has revealed a number of genetic changes that may contribute to the development of the cancer. For example, researchers have identified mutations in genes that are involved in cell growth and division, such as beta-catenin and RAS family genes, as well as in genes that control cell signaling pathways, such as phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene. Studies have also found chromosomal abnormalities, like i(17q) and focal amplifications on 8q, which are recurrently found in hepatoblastoma and may contribute to its development. One important finding from genome sequencing studies of hepatoblastoma is the discovery of a subtype of the cancer called the Wnt-activated subtype, which is characterized by mutations in the beta-catenin gene and other genes in the Wnt signaling pathway. This subtype is associated with a more favorable outcome than other subtypes, highlighting the importance of understanding the genetic subtypes of cancer in order to develop more targeted and effective treatments. Moreover, Genomic sequencing and profiling are increasingly used in the clinical setting to guide patient care. These techniques can provide valuable information about the specific genetic changes that are driving a patient's cancer, which can be used to select the most appropriate treatment. For example, if a patient's tumor harbors a specific mutation, they may be eligible for a targeted therapy that targets that specific mutation, rather than a more general chemotherapy. Overall, genome sequencing and other genomic tools are playing an increasingly important role in our understanding of hepatoblastoma and other forms of cancer, providing insights into the genetic changes that contribute to the development of the disease and helping to pave the way for more effective treatments.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Julie Chessell<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Stomach cancer mostly affects older individuals and lifetime risk of developing stomach cancer is higher in men than in women. There are many other risk factors to developing stomach cancer such as age, gender, ethnicity, genetics, having the Helicobacter pylori infection, tobacco use and many others. Smoking cigarettes increases the risk of stomach cancer, particularly near the esophagus. Among individuals that smoke, the rate of stomach cancer is doubled. However, a new alternative tobacco product technology has disrupted the tobacco industry: electronic cigarettes. In 2020, 3.7% of U.S. adults currently used e-cigarettes and in 2022, 2.55 million U.S. middle and high school students used e-cigarettes in the past 30 days. Although e-cigarettes have the potential to benefit adult smokers, we do not yet know the long-term impact of e-cigarettes on health. An NHANES study indicated that e-cigarette users had an early age of cancer onset and higher risk for cancer. E-cigarette users had 2.2 times (95% CI: 2.2-2.3, p&#60;0.001) higher risk of having cancer compared to non-smokers. In order to learn more about the association between e-cigarettes, we need to characterize tobacco user groups, biomarkers of tobacco exposure, biomarkers of cancer outcomes, and evaluate trends of biomarkers of outcome clusters. I aim to do this by exploring these variables using the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study to answer my research questions: 1: Do known tobacco-related biomarkers of exposure levels change with exclusive e-cigarette use compared to cigarette use, dual use, and non-use in PATH Wave 1? 2: Similarly, do levels of known tobacco-related biomarkers of harm (inflammatory markers, cancer biomarkers, ulcers and potential new biomarkers of harm) shift with exclusive e-cigarette use compared to cigarette use, dual use, and non-use in PATH Wave 1? 3: Based on existing data by May 2023, how does use of oral tobacco, smoking cigarettes, vaping e-cigarettes impact h. pylori diagnosis, gastric ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding, gastric cancer diagnoses in adults in the US?","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":",,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":",,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Mahathi Vojjala<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.
