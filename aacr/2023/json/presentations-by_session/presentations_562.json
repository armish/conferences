Enzalutamide (ENZA), a second&#8208;generation androgen receptor (AR) antagonist, has significantly increased CRPC patient survival. However, resistance remains a prominent obstacle in treatment, illustrating the urgent need to develop new approaches to increase ENZA efficacy.<br \/>Methods: A Kinome&#8208;wide CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 screen was used to identify the targets related to ENZA response. In vitro cell viability and in vivo cell line or patient&#8208;derived xenografts were used to verify inhibiting CK1&#945; overcoming ENZA resistance. RNA sequencing was used to address the functions of CK1&#945; in ENZA resistance. In vitro kinase assay was used to study ATM phosphorylation by CK1&#945;. Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, immunoblot and immunoprecipitation assays were used to study the functions of CK1&#945; in regulation of ATM and DNA damage response signaling. Bioinformatics analysis was used to confirm these findings with clinical patients&#8217; database.<br \/>Results: Utilizing a kinome&#8208;wide CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 knockout screen, we identified casein kinase 1 alpha (CK1&#945;) as a novel therapeutic target to overcome ENZA resistance. Depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of CK1&#945; with a novel compound in clinical trial significantly enhanced EZNA efficacy in ENZA resistant cell lines and patient&#8208;derived xenografts. Mechanistically, CK1&#945; phosphorylates the serine residue S1270 and modulates the protein abundance of ataxia&#8208;telangiectasia mutated (ATM), which is a primary initiator of DNA double&#8208;strand break (DSB)&#8208;response signaling, and is compromised in ENZA&#8208;resistant cells and patients. Inhibition of CK1&#945; stabilizes ATM, resulting in the restoration of DSB&#8208;response signaling, and thus increases ENZA&#8208;induced cell death and growth arrest in an ATM&#8208;dependent manner.<br \/>Conclusions: Our study details an innovative therapeutic approach for ENZA&#8208;resistant PCa and characterizes a novel perspective for the function of CK1&#945; in the regulation of DNA damage response signaling through phosphorylation of ATM S1270.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB09-03 Drug resistance,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Enzalutamide,CRISPR\/Cas9,DNA damage response,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jinghui Liu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yue Zhao<sup>2<\/sup>, Derek Allison<sup>1<\/sup>, Daheng He<sup>1<\/sup>, Lang Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiaoqi Liu<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY,<sup>2<\/sup>The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bbaa434b-bc1f-45c5-bf36-a45ed66dcc4f","ControlNumber":"5310","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Here, we aimed to elucidate the mechanisms by which p53 mutation promotes the early neoplastic progression of cardia progenitor cells in a mouse model of BE (L2-IL1&#946;).<br \/>Methods: We generated the transgenic mice L2-IL1&#946;; Cck2r-CreERT2; tdTomato; p53<sup>R172H\/+<\/sup> to determine the effect of p53 mutation on Cck2r<sup>+<\/sup> cardia progenitor cell activity. Lineage tracing and pathological assessment were performed in combination at different time points to explore the effects of p53 mutation on development of precancerous lesions in the cardia glands. Organoids were derived from sorted Cck2r<sup>+<\/sup> cardia cells with or without p53 mutation. Organoid forming capacity and growth assessment were tested to assess stemmness potential. Organoids were treated with the DNA damaging agent N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) to test the resistance of p53 mutant organoids to carcinogenic injury. Orthotopic transplantation of organoids into immunodeficient (NSG) mice was performed to study the influence of p53 mutation on growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of precancerous lesions and bulk RNA-seq analysis of cardia organoids from BE mice were carried out to investigate the effects of p53 mutation on key regulatory pathways.<br \/>Results: Characterization of pathological progression combined with lineage tracing showed that over time, most p53 mutant cells did not undergo metaplasia but progressed to dysplasia in the cardia glands of IL1&#946; mice. This suggests that the dysplastic cells likely arose directly from stem or progenitor cells rather than progressing first through metaplasia, a finding consistent with the scRNA-seq analysis. <i>In vitro<\/i>, p53 mutation increased the number and size of organoids derived from Cck2r<sup>+<\/sup> progenitor cells from IL1&#946; mice, suggesting an expansion of stem or progenitor cells. Furthermore, p53 mutation led to increased resistance of these organoids to MNU. Orthotopic transplantation experiments demonstrated that p53 mutation increased survival and proliferation of organoids in the stroma of immunodeficient murine stomach. Moreover, p53 mutant transplanted organoids retained dysplastic features with little to no metaplastic events relative to their WT counterparts. Computational analyses suggested that these heterotypic gains function <i>in vivo<\/i> and <i>in vitro<\/i> are relate to their inhibitory effect of stem cell differentiation through Notch signaling activation.<br \/>Conclusion: These findings suggest that p53<sup>R172H\/+<\/sup> mutation in SCJ progenitor cells directly promotes their progression toward dysplasia, rather than differentiating into metaplasia, due in part through activation of Notch signaling to maintain stemness.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Barrett's esophagus,p53 mutations,Tumor heterogeneity,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Guodong Lian<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ermanno Malagola<sup>1<\/sup>, Junfei Zhao<sup>2<\/sup>, Richard A.

Polyps from FAP patients uniquely facilitate interrogation of the continuum of malignant transformation from histologically normal mucosa to benign and dysplastic polyps and eventual adenocarcinomas. As part of the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), we performed multi-omic profiling, including whole genome sequencing, on 135 samples from six FAP patients across the pre-malignant continuum spanning all physical regions of the large intestine, and serving as the most comprehensive FAP dataset available. Through a comparative analysis with a published FAP cohort (58 multi-region samples across 5 patients) and sporadic colorectal cancer cohort (n=57), each including benign and malignant samples, we evaluate the timing of driver acquisitions at each stage of malignant progression. Despite being separated by vast regions of histologically normal mucosa, independently evolving polyps show extensive mutation sharing, suggesting FAP polyps are polyclonal in origin. Finally, we leverage a simplified mechanistic model of embryonic colonic development demonstrating that the path to malignant transformation in FAP is consistent with polyclonal origins attributable to early mixing, perhaps as early as <i>in-utero<\/i>. Taken together, the HTAN FAP Atlas provides a novel window into the earliest stages of cancer formation and may illuminate barriers to malignant transformation and opportunities for earlier intervention.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Clonal evolution,Modeling,Systems biology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ryan  O.

We sought to define the mechanisms by which purines regulate DNA repair and therapy response.<br \/>Methods: Crispr\/Cas9, siRNA, and CDNA overexpression and immunoblot were used to modulate and confirm protein levels. &#947;-H2AX and Rad51 foci were enumerated using immunofluorescence. Fluorescent reporter assays were performed to detect DNA repair activity. Phosphoproteomics was used to identify GTP-dependent (de)phosphorylation events after RT and antibodies generated against novel sites. Celltiter-glo or clonogenic assay were performed to evaluate drug\/RT responses. IHC was used to detect protein expression. Animal models of glioblastoma and normal tissue (irradiation of GI system) were used to assess DNA repair and treatment responses <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Results: Pharmacogenomic inhibition of GTP (but not ATP) synthesis sensitized GBM cells to RT, slowed the repair of RT-induced DSBs and inhibited the activity of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), but not homologous recombination (HR). These effects could be rescued by GTP (but not ATP) supplementation. We found a GTP-dependent RT-induced dephosphorylation event on Abl interactor 1 (Abi-1) serine 323 (S323) using phosphoproteomics. We generated a new antibody for p-Abi-1 (S323), validated its specificity, and confirmed that RT causes a GTP-dependent dephosphorylation of Abi-1 (S323). Knockout of Abi-1 slowed RT-induced DSB repair and this was rescued by re-expression of dephosphomimetic Abi-1 (S323A) but not phosphomimetic Abi-1 (S323D). Abi-1 canonically binds to the small GTP-activated protein Rac1. Expression of constitutively active Rac1 promoted the dephosphorylation of Abi-1 (S323) and DSB repair while these effects were blocked by dominant negative Rac1. Pharmacogenomic inhibition of protein phosphatase 5 reversed the GTP- and Rac1-mediated dephosphorylation of Abi-1 and DSB repair. These findings have therapeutic relevance. In GBM PDX samples, levels of p-Abi-1 (S323) negatively correlated with Rac1 activity and predicted favorable efficacy of genotoxic treatments. In orthotopic GBM mouse models, inhibition of Rac1 enhanced RT responses and suppressed Abi-1 S323 dephosphorylation. Abi-1 knockout enhanced efficacy of numerous genotoxic treatments and could be rescued by Abi-1 S323A (but not Abi-1 S323D) re-expression. This regulation is generalizable beyond brain cancer, as GTP supplementation promoted DNA repair and p-Abi1 (S323) dephosphorylation in normal astrocytes and enteroids and protected mice from RT-mediated gastrointestinal injury.<br \/>Conclusions: GTP promotes DNA repair by activating Rac1 and PP5 to dephosphorylate Abi-1 and stimulate NHEJ. Disrupting this regulation could improve brain tumor treatment responses while augmenting it could help protect normal tissues from genotoxic injury.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB05-05 Radiation-induced DNA damage,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radioresistance,DNA repair,GTPase activating protein,Glioblastoma multiforme,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Weihua Zhou<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Angelica Lin<sup>1<\/sup>, Zitong Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, John Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Kari Wilder-Romans<sup>1<\/sup>, Jie Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Sumeet Solanki<sup>1<\/sup>, Jing Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Annabel Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Andrew Scott<sup>1<\/sup>, Ayesha Kothari<sup>1<\/sup>, Erik Peterson<sup>1<\/sup>, Navyateja Korimerla<sup>1<\/sup>, Jessica Liang<sup>1<\/sup>, Janna Jacobson<sup>1<\/sup>, Sravya Palavalasa<sup>1<\/sup>, Alexandra Obrien<sup>1<\/sup>, Sean Ferris<sup>1<\/sup>, Shuang Zhao<sup>3<\/sup>, Jann N.

Unfortunately, osimertinib monotherapy inevitably leads to both EGFR-dependent and EGFR-independent resistance mechanisms that reactivate RTK\/MAPK pathway signaling. Thus, exploration of new combination strategies that target RTK\/MAPK-mediated bypass of EGFR dependence may circumvent or delay therapeutic resistance are a key research focus. Preclinically, it has been shown that EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines are sensitive to inhibition of an upstream node of the MAPK pathway, the Son of Sevenless homolog 1 (SOS1) protein, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the RAS subfamily of small GTPases. MRTX0902 is a selective and potent SOS1 inhibitor currently in Phase 1 clinical trials and functions by disrupting the KRAS\/SOS1 protein-protein interaction to prevent SOS1-mediated nucleotide exchange on KRAS, ultimately leading to downregulation of KRAS-MAPK pathway signaling. Here we demonstrate that dual inhibition of SOS1 and mutant EGFR by osimertinib results in greater anchorage-independent (3D) cell death and further downregulation of MAPK and PI3K\/AKT pathway signaling compared to single agent osimertinib treatment. In our current study, we characterized the anti-tumor effects of SOS1 inhibition by MRTX0902 as a monotherapy and in combination with osimertinib in EGFR mutant models of NSCLC. While single agent MRTX0902 treatment effectively inhibited EGFR mutant cell survival, combination treatment of MRTX0902 with osimertinib resulted in (1) deeper and sustained inhibition of MAPK and PI3K\/AKT pathway signaling, (2) enhanced inhibition of 3D cell viability and increased apoptosis, and (3) increased anti-tumor efficacy compared to osimertinib monotherapy in EGFR mutant CDX models <i>in vivo<\/i>. These studies uncover the potential clinical application of combined vertical inhibition of RTK\/MAPK pathway signaling by osimertinib and MRTX0902 and ultimately aide in the understanding of EGFR and RAS biology in targeted cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET05-02 Cellular responses to anticancer drugs,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"EGFR,Son of Sevenless homolog 1 (SOS1),Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling,KRAS,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shilpi Khare<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Niranjan Sudhakar<sup><\/sup>, Jade Laguer<sup><\/sup>, David  M.

However, it remains unclear which of the amplified genes are oncogenic drivers, obstacles to rational therapeutic development. We defined a minimal 12q amplicon in human liposarcoma, and tested the oncogenic activity of each recurrently amplified gene to accelerate the onset of AKT-induced STS in a genetically engineered zebrafish model of the disease. This revealed several genes whose overexpression accelerated the onset of AKT-induced STS, including METTL1, best-known for its ability to catalyze methylation of tRNAs. Surprisingly, catalytically defective mutants of METTL1 exhibited oncogenic activity that was at least as potent as the wild-type gene in zebrafish and human STS, indicating enzyme-independent oncogenic functions. We found that METTL1 promotes ribosome assembly and oncogenic translation independent of its enzymatic activity. In human liposarcoma cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, METTL1 overexpression was sufficient to stimulate polysome formation, and this effect was phenocopied by catalytically dead mutants of METTL1. METTL1 overexpression also robustly stimulated the rate of protein synthesis in cells (P &#60; 0.0001), and in a cell-free biochemical assay for translation of a reporter mRNA (P &#60; 0.001). The ability of METTL1 to stimulate ribosomal function triggered a therapeutically targetable dependency, because small molecule inhibitors of ribosome biogenesis had potent therapeutic activity against METTL1-amplified (P &#60; 0.0001), but not METTL1 wild-type, sarcoma cells. Thus, METTL1 is a soft tissue sarcoma oncogene that stimulates oncogenic translation independent of its enzymatic activity, an oncogenic function that can be targeted therapeutically.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB11-06 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Oncogene,Translation,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Raja Hussain Ali<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Brianna Silverman<sup>2<\/sup>, Esteban  A.

Radioresistance is a major cause of both treatment failure and poor prognosis, with locoregional recurrence after radiotherapy occurring in up to 50% of HNC patients. Despite the discovery of individual genes implicated in the ability of HNC cells to develop radioresistance, a systematic evaluation remains to be undertaken. This project is the first to conduct genome-wide CRISPR screens for regulators of radioresistance in HNC, with the aim to identify phenotype-driving genes and pathways.<br \/>Experimental Procedures: Genome-wide negative selection screens were conducted on HNC cell lines using the Toronto KnockOut (TKO) CRISPR library. Monoclonal Cas9 cell lines were derived from UT-SCC-42A (42A), FaDu, and PE\/CA-PJ41 (clone D2) with Cas9 editing efficiencies &#62;80%. Library-transduced cells were treated with the minimum dose of radiation resulting in cessation of cell growth (10 Gy for 42A and FaDu; 8 Gy for PE\/CA-PJ41). Genomic DNA from the resultant radioresistant populations was extracted and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500. MAGeCK analysis of read counts identified gene targets of significantly depleted gRNAs after irradiation. Genes that correlated with overall survival (OS) in the TCGA Pan-Cancer database were selected for further investigation. The top candidate genes in the determination of radioresponse were validated using cell proliferation and clonogenic assays. Effects of loss-of-function on cell migration were assessed using scratch wound and transwell migration assays.<br \/>Results: 117 putative radioresistance genes were identified in the 42A cell line screen; the top ranked hits were MMP14, CD44, CALR, and HHLA1. RNA expression levels of these genes had a significant correlation with OS of radiation-treated HNC patients in the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas. Loss-of-function of the candidate genes was confirmed to increase radiosensitivity through live cell imaging in 42A and PJ41 cells, which were further corroborated with clonogenic assays. Downregulation of at least one gene impaired the migration of 42A and PJ41 cells, suggesting a role in cellular invasion and migration.<br \/>Conclusion: This study will contribute to a deeper understanding of mechanisms of radioresistance in HNC, which continues to be a leading cause of mortality in HNC patients. Future pathway elucidation through transcriptome analysis and functional characterization may reveal additional therapeutic targets that can improve the outcome for HNC patients treated with radiation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB07-01 Modulators of radiation response,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Radioresistance,Head and neck cancers,CRISPR\/Cas9,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jacqueline  H.
