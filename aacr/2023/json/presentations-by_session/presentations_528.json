Molecular determinants of K<sup>G12C<\/sup>i efficacy in NSCLC are poorly defined. We dissected the impact of major <i>K<sup>G12C<\/sup> <\/i>co-mutations and explored the effects of less prevalent co-alterations on the clinical activity of K<sup>G12C<\/sup>i in the largest treated cohort to date of patients (pts) with advanced NSCLC. Key findings were validated in preclinical <i>K<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i> NSCLC models.<br \/>Methods: Baseline clinico-genomic features and clinical outcome data from pts with stage IV <i>K<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i> NSCLC (ECOG PS 0-2) treated with single-agent K<sup>G12C<\/sup>i were collected retrospectively from 20 centers in the US and Europe. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate PFS and OS and differences were assessed with the log-rank test. Hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% CI were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model stratified for clinical co-variates. The impact of selected co-alterations on sotorasib efficacy was assessed in syngeneic (C57BL\/6) <i>K<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i> NSCLC models.<br \/>Results: 411 eligible pts were included in the study. Median age was 68 years, 77% of pts had received both platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-(L)1 inhibitors and 35% had brain metastases. 83% of pts received sotorasib. ORR with K<sup>G12C<\/sup>i was 32.4% (95% CI, 27.9-37.1), PFS was 5.1m (95% CI, 4.5-5.6) and OS was 10.2m (95% CI, 8.4-12.1). Co-alterations in <i>KEAP1<\/i>, <i>SMARCA4<\/i> and <i>CDKN2A\/B<\/i> were each associated with significantly shorter PFS (<i>KEAP1:<\/i> 2.8m vs 5.5m, HR 2.50, P&#60;0.001; <i>SMARCA4:<\/i> 1.7m vs 5.5m, HR 2.64, P=0.001; <i>CDKN2A\/B:<\/i> 2.3m vs 5.3m, HR 2.57, P&#60;0.001) and OS with K<sup>G12C<\/sup>i even after adjustment for clinical covariates. <i>STK11<\/i> co-mutations without concurrent <i>KEAP1<\/i> alterations did not impact clinical outcomes with K<sup>G12C<\/sup>i. In an exploratory analysis, co-mutations in DNA damage repair (DDR) genes and genes encoding components of the ATRX\/DAXX\/EZH2 pathway were associated with improved K<sup>G12C<\/sup>i efficacy, whereas PI3K\/AKT\/MTOR\/PTEN alterations and missense <i>ROS1\/ALK\/BRAF\/NTRK1-3<\/i> mutations resulted in inferior outcomes. The impact of <i>SMARCA4<\/i> and DDR gene<i> <\/i>inactivation was validated in isogenic syngeneic<i> K<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/i>NSCLC models; additional co-alterations are under evaluation. Integration of <i>KEAP1\/SMARCA4\/CDKN2A\/B<\/i> co-mutations identified a subgroup (<i>KSC<sup>MUT<\/sup><\/i>, 37.6% of all pts) with significantly shorter PFS (2.7m vs 6.2m, P&#60;0.001) and OS (6.3m vs 14.6m, P&#60;0.001) that accounted for 57.3% of pts with primary refractory (PFS&#8804;3m) disease.<br \/>Conclusions: Co-mutations in <i>KEAP1<\/i>, <i>SMARCA4<\/i> and <i>CDKN2A\/2B<\/i> define subgroups of K<sup>G12C<\/sup> NSCLC pts with markedly distinct outcomes with K<sup>G12C<\/sup>i monotherapy. Tailoring of K<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor-anchored therapeutic strategies and patient stratification should take into account the co-mutation status of individual tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"KRAS,Inhibitors,Biomarkers,Efficacy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Marcelo V.

However, clinical studies of targeted treatments in ATM-aberrant patients have yielded mixed results; thus, identifying the optimal strategy for selecting patients with ATM LOF tumors remains a critical area of unmet need.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: In order to investigate the heterogeneity observed in ATM aberrant tumors, we conducted a pan-cancer genomic and proteomic profiling of ATM LOF, and also performed retrospective review of clinical outcomes for a subset of patients with ATM LOF treated with platinum or ATR inhibition.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: We identified 10,609 <i>ATM<\/i> variants in 8,587 patients with cancer. The prevalence of deleterious (Tier 1) versus variants of unknown significance (VUS)\/benign (Tier 2) variants differed by cancer tissue type, as did selective pressure for loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Analysis of ATM protein staining in 471 patient tumors showed tumors with null, inactivating variants were significantly (p&#60;0.005) more likely to display ATM loss of protein (LOP) than tumors with missense or wildtype, but 19% (N=27\/140) and 9% (N=13\/149) of tumors with ATM-VUS and wildtype showed loss of protein. In addition, concordance between inactivating mutations and loss of protein also differed based on tumor tissue context, with ovarian and breast cancer showing stronger concordance (greater than 80%) than melanoma and lung cancer ( less than 20%). Patients treated with platinum chemotherapy with select tumor types with deleterious variants in <i>ATM<\/i> and ATM LOP display improved progression free survival (PFS) (HR 0.50, P=0.03). Lastly, patients with tumor types that have stronger ATM variant-to-protein loss concordance display increased benefit from ATR inhibition (HR 0.40, P=0.04).<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: Our data highlight that there is heterogeneity in ATM LOF in patients due to multiple variables, including notable tissue-specific differences in the type of variants seen and the relationship between <i>ATM<\/i> variant status and ATM protein.

Following primary BC therapy ~40% of patients will develop metastatic BC (MBC) and 60-70% of the recurrent disease will occur at distant sites. Median survival of MBC patients with distant recurrence is ~2-3 yr. While the early detection and monitoring of BC progression are essential to improve prognosis and reduce BC-related mortality, there is a lack of surveillance strategies for monitoring patients for distant recurrence of MBC. The aim of our study was to identify urinary biomarkers for detection and monitoring of MBC.<br \/>Method: We have conducted a comparative label-free LC-MS\/MS analysis of the urinary proteome of patients with MBC and healthy age-matched controls (HC). A hybrid quadrupole time of flight (Q-Tof&#8482;) mass spectrometer was used for urine analysis via liquid chromatography (LC) with tandem mass spectrometry (MS\/MS). Three different database search algorithms were used for peptide identification including MASCOT, Protein Lynx Global Server and Ion Accounting software. Only peptides detected in at least two out of three replicated LC-MS experiments were counted towards protein identification. Identified candidate biomarkers were validated via ELISA assays.<br \/>Results: Using this approach, we identified ~400 urinary proteins of which ~104 and 89 were unique to the MBC and HC groups, respectively. Upregulated proteins in the MBC cohort were associated with angiogenesis, apoptosis, proteolysis, ECM regulation, and cell adhesion pathways. Using bioinformatic and <i>in silico<\/i> approaches, we identified a specific metastasis signature comprised of CALB1, S100A8, ZAG, VTN and TN. Diagnostic accuracies of these candidate markers were validated using independent training and validation sets according to the REMARK criteria. Urinary VTN (uVTN) and uTN levels correlated significantly with disease status in MBC patients when compared to patients with locally invasive BC and HC. Interestingly, a small subset of patients with bone metastasis also had significantly higher uVTN levels. A multiplexed marker panel of uVTN and uTN could discriminate between HC and MBC groups (<i>AUC<\/i>=0.831, <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.001). Blinded testing indicated that uVTN levels (cutoff&#62;1018 ng\/ml) could discriminate (<i>AUC<\/i>=0.782, <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.006) between MBC and HC. Longitudinal analysis of samples from MBC patients indicated a strong correlation between uVTN levels and disease status.<br \/>Conclusions: Our findings suggest that uVTN and uTN have the potential to serve as biomarkers for the detection of MBC. While validation in larger cohorts is necessary, these results may be useful in the development of noninvasive diagnostic tests for monitoring BC progression and recurrence.

While GRs reportedly control the expression of up to 20% of the human genome, specific targets of systemic GR antagonism in humans have yet to be identified. To address this question, we established a robust NanoString assay to measure candidate GR target genes in human blood and assessed them before and after therapy with the oral SGRM relacorilant, which selectively antagonizes the GR. In a randomized, controlled phase 2 study in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (NCT03776812), gene changes were assessed in 139 patients after treatment with relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel (NP) or NP alone. Using cross-validated random forest methods, a gene panel that accurately identified patients who had received relacorilant was established (ROC AUC 0.945 +\/- 0.038). In 13 patients who crossed over from NP alone to relacorilant + NP, the genes in the panel were modified only after crossover (paired t&#8209;test <i>P<\/i>=0.0003), validating the gene panel&#8217;s ability to detect GR activity. The 4 most induced (<i>LILRB4, FPR3, CLEC10A, CCR2<\/i>) and 4 most suppressed (<i>CDKN1C, TNFRSF17, BRIP1, PDK1<\/i>) genes by relacorilant + NP vs. NP alone were selected and shown to be reliable indicators of GR activity across clinical studies in patients with pancreatic, prostate, and other solid tumors (NCT04329949, NCT03674814, NCT02762981), independent of concomitant medications or other confounders. <i>CLEC10A<\/i> (C-type lectin domain containing 10A) was identified as a particularly sensitive marker of GR activity as its expression was strongly suppressed by the GR agonist prednisone in healthy volunteers (paired t-test <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.00010, NCT03335956) and strongly induced by relacorilant in patients with solid tumors (paired t-test <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.00010). <i>CLEC10A<\/i> induction in blood by relacorilant was associated with longer overall survival in patients with ovarian cancer treated with relacorilant + NP (HR=0.39, Cox PH <i>P<\/i>=0.0135). High baseline tumor <i>CLEC10A<\/i> expression was also associated with longer overall survival in a large tumor &#8216;omics&#8217; database (N=1656 ovarian tumors; HR 0.8, log-rank <i>P<\/i>=0.0008). <i>CLEC10A<\/i> and the genes correlated with its expression were found to be primarily expressed by a specific subset of dendritic cells, supporting previous reports that GR agonism can suppress dendritic cells. This analysis of <i>CLEC10A<\/i> and other identified GR target genes confirmed that systemic GR activity in patients with a range of solid tumors can be modulated pharmacologically, indicates that GR modulation may be associated with survival in patients with ovarian cancer, and provides new insights into the systemic functions of the GR in humans.<b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Solid tumors,Glucocorticoid receptor,Biomarkers,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Nicoletta Colombo<sup>1<\/sup>, Toon Van Gorp<sup>2<\/sup>, Ursula  A.

Importantly, a Phase 1 study testing OMO-103, an Omomyc-based mini-protein developed by Peptomyc S.L., was successfully completed in 2022. Here, we present the main findings of the study and associated biomarker program.<br \/>Material and Methods: A phase I dose escalation study was performed in all-comers solid tumor patients, with a 3+3 design of 6 dose levels ranging from 0.48 to 9.72mg\/kg, as a weekly 30-min i.v. infusion. Tumor and liquid biopsies were collected at screening, upon and at the end of treatment, to assess different biomarkers of drug activity.<br \/>Results: 22 patients with advanced solid tumors were included and 18 patients were considered evaluable for response by CT scan. Of these, 9 achieved SD. The PK analysis revealed a plasma half-life of &#62;40h. No ADAs were detected in any of the patients. Drug pharmacodynamics supported target engagement, as demonstrated by Digital Spatial Profiling analysis showing shut down of MYC transcriptional signature in patients&#8217; tumor biopsies. In addition, a distinctive pharmacodynamic cytokine signature that correlated with stable disease was found through liquid biopsies already 3 to 4 weeks before CT scan. Importantly, a cytokine signature was also identified as being predictive of disease stabilization at baseline and could help stratify patients in upcoming additional clinical studies. Finally, several anti-tumor immune related markers were also found modulated upon OMO-103 treatment.<br \/>Conclusion: OMO-103 demonstrates a favorable safety profile, with encouraging signs of activity supported by predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers worthy of further investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Myc,Peptides,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Marie-Eve Beaulieu<sup>1<\/sup>, Elena Garralda<sup>2<\/sup>, Sílvia Casacuberta-Serra<sup>1<\/sup>, Sandra Sandra Martínez-Martín<sup>1<\/sup>, Emiliano Calvo<sup>3<\/sup>, Víctor Moreno<sup>4<\/sup>, Sergio López-Estévez<sup>1<\/sup>, Laia Foradada<sup>1<\/sup>, Guzman Alonso<sup>2<\/sup>, Elena Corral<sup>3<\/sup>, Bernard Doger<sup>4<\/sup>, Tatiana Hernández<sup>4<\/sup>, Judit Grueso<sup>2<\/sup>, Íñigo Íñigo González-Larreategui<sup>2<\/sup>, Erika Serrano del Pozo<sup>2<\/sup>, Hugo Thabussot<sup>1<\/sup>, Virginia Castillo Cano<sup>1<\/sup>, Mariano  F.

Recently proposed RNA expression based molecular classifiers of bladder cancer identified high p63 expression as a component of a basal\/squamous subtype linked to poor patient prognosis. The interplay between p63 expression status and the anti-tumor immunity in bladder cancer is unknown.<br \/><b><\/b><b>Design:<\/b> To assess the prognostic impact of p63 expression and the relationship between p63 and the immune tumor microenvironment we have stained tissue microarrays containing more than 2300 urothelial bladder carcinomas with 22 antibodies (i.e., p63, CD3, CD8, CD4, FOXP3, CD20, CD68, CD163, CD11c, TIM3, PD-L1, PD-1, CTLA-4, panCK, Ki-67, CD31, Vimentin, HLA-DRa, Myosin-11, Desmoglein 3, PAX-8, CDH16) using conventional brightfield and multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry (BLEACH&#38;STAIN). A framework of several neuronal networks for image analysis were used. Spatial immune parameters were compared with histopathological parameters and overall survival data. The area under (tAUC) time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves was used to compare the prognostic relevance of different prognostic markers.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Nuclear p63 staining was seen in all cells of normal urothelium and in all pTaG2 tumors, mostly at high levels. The rate of p63 positive cases and the staining intensity was lower in pTaG3 tumors (93.2%, p&#60;0.0001 for pTaG3 vs pTaG2) and markedly lower in pT2-4 carcinomas (83.5%, p=0.0120 for pT2-4 vs. pTaG3). A low p63 expression was linked to a low density of T-helper cells (p=0.044) and regulatory T-cells (p=0.0053) localized in the intraepithelial tumor component as well as in the stroma, while all other analyzed T-cells and macrophages subsets where unrelated to p63 expression. Within pT2-4 carcinomas, low p63 expression was linked to nodal metastasis (p=0.0028) and overall survival (p=0.0005). The association of p63 loss with survival was independent of pT and pN (p=0.0109). The predictive performance of intraepithelial CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cytotoxic T-cells (tAUC: 0.70) was even higher than the predictive performance of p63 expression (tAUC: 0.57, p=0.0017).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>In summary, our data show that p63 is downregulated in a fraction of urothelial neoplasms that are associated with a particularly poor prognosis and a low density of T-helper and regulatory T-cells. The even higher predictive performance of intraepithelial CD8<sup>+<\/sup> cytotoxic T-cells underlines the strong prognostic role of the immune tumor microenvironment in muscle invasive bladder cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-07 Prognostic biomarkers,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"p63,Tumor microenvironment,Deep learning,Bladder cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Henning Plage<sup>1<\/sup>, Sebastian Hofbauer<sup>1<\/sup>, Kira Kornienko<sup>1<\/sup>, Paul G.

Using state-of-the-art whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing (WGTS) analysis we interrogated a pan cancer cohort to nominate new treatment options. WGS was performed on 414 tumor\/germline pairs from our pan cancer cohort of 355 patients, of which 103 had results of other commercial NGS assays. RNAseq data was available in 96 samples. We employed the Isabl GxT analytic platform and manually curated single base substitution (COSMIC v3) mutational signatures and structural variants (SVs). WGTS results were correlated with available clinico-pathologic data. High throughput drug screening that included PARP inhibitors and functional validation were performed in 61 matched patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTO). <b> <\/b> We found 5,129 SVs affecting at least one cancer gene in 88% of cases. High-confidence homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), determined by curation of mutational signatures and mutations\/SVs affecting oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, was detected in 8.3% of solid tumors (<i>e.g.,<\/i> prostate, pancreas, ovarian, uterine, breast, gallbladder, and stomach carcinomas). HRD status included tumors with <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> wildtype and SVs impacting <i>BRCA1\/2, RAD51<\/i>, <i>ATM<\/i> and other HRD genes. <i>CDK12<\/i>-loss associated genomic instability was detected in 7 cases including 3 cases of prostate adenocarcinoma. 93 gene fusions involving cancer genes were detected including known and novel fusions of potential significance (<i>e.g.,<\/i> <i>SLC45A3::ALK <\/i>in metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma<i>, TMEM106A::BRCA1 <\/i>in serious ovarian carcinoma<i>, ESR1::EP300 <\/i>in metastatic breast cancer). Some tumor cohorts demonstrated enrichment of drivers <i>e.g.,<\/i> <i>FGFR1 <\/i>amplification in male breast cancer, rearrangements at the TERT locus in adrenocortical carcinoma, enrichment for repeat-mediated deletion attributed to mismatch repair (MMR) in gynecological carcinosarcoma, and SVs affecting<i> FHIT<\/i> in gastric adenocarcinoma. Drug screening of PDTO and functional testing with RAD51 immunofluorescence assay validated high-confidence HRD annotation. One example is a <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> wildtype pancreatic adenocarcinoma with increased tandem duplications and SV (inversion) impacting<i> BRCA2<\/i>, and high-confidence HRD by our novel WGS classifier. Drug screening of the corresponding PDTO showed an enhanced response to Olaparib, in contrast to cases without HRD that did not. We have used state-of-the-art analysis of WGTS to improve the detection of targets and significant biomarkers in a pan cancer cohort, including HRD, <i>CDK12<\/i>-type genomic instability, pathogenic germline mutations and potential targetable novel fusions. A robust and clinically relevant <i>ex vivo<\/i> preclinical model allowed us to validate a WGS-based classifier that detects HRD even in cancers with wildtype <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-01 Biomarkers predictive of therapeutic benefit,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Whole genome sequencing,Biomarkers,Homologous recombination,Organoids,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Majd Al Assaad<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hui-Hsuan Kuo<sup>2<\/sup>, Jones Nauseef<sup>1<\/sup>, Max F.
