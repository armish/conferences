One construct comprises a 41BB co-stimulatory domain, while the second construct has a CD28 co-stimulatory domain. The first 2 CARs have a wild-type CD3z, whereas the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> bears Michel Sadelain&#8217;s &#8220;1XX&#8221; mutations in CD3z. These are 2 Tyrosine to Phenylalanine mutations in ITAM 2 and ITAM 3. The 1XX mutations were designed to slow signaling to eliminate the problem of CAR T cell exhaustion. Human T cells were separately transduced with the 3 CARs and tested in NSG mice bearing human breast tumors. The tumors were heterogeneous tumors comprising parent cells that fluoresce red and express medium to low amounts of the antigen, MUC1*, and cells that fluoresce green wherein the parent cells have been transduced to express more MUC1*. The percent of the tumor that expressed high levels of MUC1* was varied from 7.5% to 15% to 30%. 150 female NSG mice were implanted with 500,000 tumor cells. The animals received a single CAR T cell injection of one of the three CAR T cells at an Effector to Target ratio of 10:1, 5:1, or 1:1. The experiment was allowed to proceed for 96 days, with periodic IVIS measurements to track tumor growth with a focus on tumor recurrence. After sacrifice, residual tumors were excised, dissociated and analyzed to determine if tumor recurrence was being driven by the high antigen cells or the low antigen cells. CAR T cells were recovered from the blood and the spleen. They were enumerated and analyzed by flow cytometry for the presence of markers of exhaustion.<br \/><b>Unpublished Results: <\/b>Tumor recurrence occurred in mice treated with CAR T cells bearing wild-type CD3z, but essentially did not recur in the mice treated with CAR T cells bearing the 1XX mutations. Four hundredfold more CAR T cells were recovered from the mice treated with the CAR-1XX cells compared to CARs with wild-type CD3z, and the CAR-1XX cells appeared not to be exhausted even after 96 days. CAR-1XX T cells administered at a 1:1 E:T ratio, with only 7.5% of the tumor comprised of high antigen expressing cells, were effectively killed with no significant tumor recurrence. In contrast, the CARs with wild-type CD3z had no effect on tumor growth in this group. Surprisingly, analysis of excised tumors showed that tumor recurrence in mice treated with CAR wild-type CD3z T cells was driven by the low antigen density cells, whereas the CAR-1XX T cells killed high antigen and low antigen density cells at the same rate.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>1XX mutations in CD3z greatly increase CAR T persistence in vivo and unexpectedly enable the killing of low antigen tumor cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,MUC1,Immunotherapy,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Cynthia  C.

One of the major reasons for this lack of clinical success is the heterogeneous expression of target tumor antigens in solid tumors. In order to better understand the limitations of CAR T cell therapy in the solid tumor setting, we utilized two clear cell RCC patient-derived xenograft models (PDX), which replicate CD70 and carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) heterogeneity of expression seen in patient kidney tumor samples.We evaluated individual CD70 CAR T or CAIX CAR T cells in PDX-bearing NSG mice and showed only partial tumor clearance. This was not due to lack of tumor infiltration since we observed trafficking to tumor sites with <i>in vivo <\/i>T cell and tumor imaging. Even with a dual targeting approach combining CD70 and CAIX CAR T cells to increase tumor coverage, we did not eradicate the kidney tumors. By analyzing the tumor antigen profiles of relapsing kidney tumors, we found that the CD70 and CAIX positive populations were cleared but detected a residual CD70 and CAIX double-negative population. Based on transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of these residual populations, we detected CD70 expression, which suggested that these CD70\/CAIX double negative populations did in fact, have ultra-low CD70 expression which was not at a level high enough to be eliminated by CD70 CAR T cells. This key finding revealed that CD70 expression was not present or absent but rather present in a spectrum ranging from high to very low. Based on this fundamental observation, we hypothesized that a highly sensitive HLA-independent T cell receptor (HIT receptor) may be used to target this ultra-low CD70 population. Indeed, treatment with CD70 HIT T cells resulted in complete and long-lasting tumor cures in both PDX models.Our findings show that we can overcome the major challenge of tumor antigen heterogeneity in RCC because apparent CD70-negative tumor populations retain CD70 expression and can be targeted by a highly sensitive HIT T cell. This represents a significant advance for the development of a potentially effective cellular therapy for RCC, which may be applicable to other aggressive CD70-positive tumors like ovarian and pancreatic cancers. Our findings underscore the critical importance of assessing antigen expression in a quantitative manner to determine if antigens are truly absent or present at very low levels, in which case they may be responsive to an engineered antigen-sensitive immune cell as afforded by the HIT receptor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Kidney cancer,,Heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sophie  A.

CD6 is a co-receptor that fine-tunes T cell receptor signal strength through a unique dual function intracellular domain. CD6 is alternatively spliced, creating isoforms that lack distinct regions which interact with activating or inhibitory adapter proteins, thereby delivering inhibitory or activating signals, respectively. We hypothesized that CAR T cell fitness, namely their ability to sustain their effector function, can be achieved by using alternatively spliced CD6 isoforms which lack exons responsible for inhibitory signaling. <i>First,<\/i> we discovered that overexpression of the canonical full-length CD6 molecule, isoform CD6A, resulted in marginal improvement of CAR T cell function, while its deletion using CRISPR\/Cas9 depressed the antitumor CAR T cell functionality. This supported a net stimulatory role for CD6 in CAR T cell function. To study their effect on cellular fitness, we then synthesized and overexpressed known alternatively spliced cytoplasmic isoforms CD6B, CD6C, CD6D, CD6E, and CD6F on CAR T cells and, noted a significant tendency towards preserving the CAR T cell na&#239;ve and central memory compartments, upon tumor encounter. Overexpression of isoform CD6F, which lacks exon 9, and to a lesser extent isoforms CD6C and CD6E enhanced the short- and long-term cytotoxicity of HER2 and CD19 targeting CAR T cells when compared to CAR T cells alone or CAR T cells overexpressing, CD6A. Despite exhibiting a lower proliferation index, and lower CAR CD3&#950; phosphorylation at rest, CD6F CAR T cells secreted significantly higher concentrations of the Th1 cytokine, IFN-&#947;, and mediated more sustained in vitro cytotoxicity long-term, with more complete elimination of large tumor cell loads. <i>Lastly,<\/i> in an orthotopic model of human glioblastoma, the adoptive transfer of CD6F HER2 CAR T cells induced a more significant but also more sustained anti-glioma effect that translated into a significant survival advantage for experimental animals. Our data support that the overexpression of the alternatively spliced CD6 isoforms improves CAR T cell fitness resulting in superior antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CAR T cells,Splice variants,Solid tumors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jessica  S.

In a phase 1 trial at our Center, CAR-T cells targeting the tumor-associated antigen ROR1 in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and triple negative breast cancer rapidly became dysfunctional and persisted poorly at tumor sites, ultimately failing to mediate objective responses. To evaluate strategies to improve ROR1 CAR-T efficacy, we adapted the Kras<sup>LSL-G12D\/+<\/sup>;p53<sup>fl\/fl<\/sup> (KP) autochthonous model of lung adenocarcinoma to express ROR1 (KP<sup>ROR1<\/sup>). This aggressive model mimics the initiation, progression, and suppressive TME of human NSCLC. ROR1 CAR-T cells in KP<sup>ROR1<\/sup> mice rapidly declined in number, lost the ability to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, and failed to significantly enhance tumor control, recapitulating the major barriers to CAR-T efficacy we observed in patients. NKTR-255 is a novel immunotherapeutic consisting of a polymer conjugated recombinant human interleukin-15 (rhIL-15) that could enhance the activity of CAR-T cells. NKTR-255 binds to the IL-15 receptor and IL-2\/IL-15 receptor, thus maintaining the full potential spectrum of IL-15 biology while exerting a sustained effect on CD8<sup>+<\/sup> memory T cell and NK cell expansion and persistence. <u>We hypothesized that the combination of CAR-T cells and NKTR-255 would be feasible and safe and may extend the duration of efficacy of ROR1 CAR-T cells in ROR1<sup>+<\/sup> lung tumors by improving their expansion and persistence<\/u>. To test this, we treated tumor-bearing KP<sup>ROR1<\/sup> mice with control or ROR1 CAR-T cells with or without weekly injections of NKTR-255. NKTR-255 treatment resulted in a robust expansion of ROR1 CAR-T cells in the peripheral blood relative to vehicle-treated mice, which correlated with increased CAR-T cell infiltration into lung tumors. CAR-T cells in NKTR-255-treated mice also showed reduced signs of T cell exhaustion, including reduced expression of inhibitory receptors and enhanced ability to produce effector cytokines upon ex vivo re-stimulation. Importantly, combination therapy with both NKTR-255 and ROR1 CAR-T cells resulted in significantly improved tumor control relative to either treatment alone.

To further understand mechanisms of resistance, including CART cell exhaustion, we employed three independent approaches: 1) RNA and ATAC sequencing on unstimulated vs. exhausted healthy donor CART19 cells by utilizing an <i>in vitro <\/i>model for exhaustion, 2) RNA and ATAC sequencing on pre-infusion CART19 cell products from responders and non-responders in the Zuma-1 clinical trial that led to the FDA approval of axi-cel CART19 therapy, and 3) a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in healthy donor CART19 cells using our <i>in vitro<\/i> model for exhaustion.<br \/>In each of these approaches, IL-4 was identified as a regulator of CART cell dysfunction. In approach 1, ingenuity pathway analysis of genes that were both differentially accessible and expressed in exhausted compared with unstimulated CART19 cells revealed IL-4 as a top upstream regulator (p = 5E-6). In approach 2, IL-4 was one of two genes that were both upregulated and more accessible in CART19 cell products from non-responders (p &#60; 5E-2). Finally, in approach 3, gene ontology enrichment analysis of genes that were positively selected during the genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen, revealed regulation of the IL-4 pathway as one of the top affected pathways (p = 1E-4).<br \/>Together, our data indicates a role for IL-4 in CART cell dysfunction caused by exhaustion. Investigating this mechanism further, we saw an increase in the production of IL-4 as CART cells became exhausted (p = 4E-3). Treatment of CART19 cells with human recombinant IL-4 (hrIL-4) resulted in dysfunction as evident by a decrease in antigen specific cytotoxicity (p = 4E-3) and proliferative ability (p= 6.5E-2), as well as exhaustion-specific signs of dysfunction such as an increase in the expression of the inhibitory receptor, TIM-3 (p = 3E-3) and an increase in the transcription of the exhaustion-related transcription factor EOMES (p = 1E-2).<br \/>Finally, we tested whether IL-4 neutralization enhances CART19 cell functions. Using a CD19<sup>+<\/sup> JeKo-1 xenograft mouse model, we compared the combination treatment of CART19 cells and an IL-4 neutralizing monoclonal antibody (10 mg\/Kg, clone # MP4-25D2) to CART19 cells and an IgG control. IL-4 neutralization in combination with CART19 cells resulted in reduced tumor burden (p = 4.6E-2), increased CART cell proliferation (p = 8E-3), and prolonged overall survival (p= 5E-2). In summary, our data indicates that 1) IL-4 induces CART cell dysfunction through a state of exhaustion and 2) IL-4 neutralization with a monoclonal antibody enhances CART cell therapy. As such, this novel combination therapy holds the potential to be translated to the clinic to improve durable responses from CART cell therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chimeric antigen receptor,Combination therapy,Resistance,Immunotherapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Carli Stewart<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Michelle  J.

Whole cell proteomics was performed on 43 matched primary\/recurrent GBM samples. Flow cytometry measured surface expression levels of GPNMB to confirm CAR-T accessibility. CRISPR\/Cas9 was used to eliminate expression in GBM lines to measure proliferation and mouse survival times. GPNMB knockout clones were generated in GL261 and engrafted in immunocompetent mice to examine single cell transcriptomes using sciRNAseq at endpoint. A second-generation CAR-T was developed to target GPNMB-expressing populations, and efficacy was interrogated using standard <i>in vitro <\/i>assays and GBM PDX models.<br \/>Results: The absence of GPNMB throughout most normal tissues validates the rationale of administering CAR-Ts as a safe modality for patients. GPNMB detected in residual tumors of PDX models treated orthotopically with CD133 CAR-Ts revealed it as a targetable subpopulation of GBM cells and a rational co-target alongside CD133 in the heterogeneous tumor. Tissue microarrays and whole cell proteomics found GPNMB to be upregulated in recurrent GBMs compared to primary (p=0.0349 and p=0.0033 respectively) while being absent in normal tissues. Single cell sequencing data of patient GBMs revealed GPNMB was also highly expressed in tumor-associated macrophages. Eliminating GPNMB in GBM cell lines decreased proliferation (P&#60;0.001) and prolonged survival times in all mouse models (P&#60;0.01) indicating its functional relevance. GPNMB knockout clones displayed downregulation of hallmark signalling pathways of GBM such as PDGFR, TGF-beta, Integrins and Stats, as well as decreased innate\/adaptive immune activation. CAR-T cytotoxicity and activation was observed <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> resulting in decreased tumor burden (P&#60;0.001) and increased survival times (P&#60;0.001). Ultimately a CD133+ population was observed in residual tumors of GPNMB CAR-T treated mice at endpoint and surface expression of CD133 and GPNMB revealed co-expression and distinct populations.<br \/>Conclusions: We show GPNMB influences tumor-intrinsic biology of GBM and is also active in macrophages in the recurrent GBM immune microenvironment. By targeting GPNMB along with CD133, combinatorial therapeutic regimens could target both the cancer stem cell hierarchy and its supportive niche. Administration of both CAR-T cell therapies to humanized mice engrafted with patient-derived GBMs will provide better cytotoxic coverage and potentially provide more durable therapeutic efficacy for GBM patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-01 Adoptive cell therapy,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,CAR T cells,Immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Neil Savage<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Franz  J.
