[{"Abstract":"The number of effective therapies approved for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is still limited and multiple strategies are continuously explored to expand the drug target repertoire. Among these, the identification of overexpressed genes has prompted the discovery of actionable oncogenic dependencies in multiple tumour types.<br \/>Starting from RNA sequencing data, we identified transcriptome-wide gene expression outliers, defined as samples showing abnormal expression for a particular gene, across 226 CRC cell lines, considering both overexpression and underexpression events as positive or negative outliers. Then, the distance of each outlier from gene-specific reference points, absolute expression values and differential expression values were considered in a multi-filter strategy to select extreme gene expression outliers, with the hypothesis that they are more likely to be functionally relevant in cancer cells. We also profiled genetic and epigenetic features of CRC cell lines based on whole exome sequencing and DNA methylation microarray data.<br \/>Extreme positive and negative gene expression outliers were found for 3,533 and 965 genes, respectively, and only some of them were associated with underlying genetic and epigenetic alterations. Gene expression alterations with known therapeutic or diagnostic value in CRC were pinpointed as extreme positive and negative outliers thus confirming the validity of the approach. Annotation of overexpressed enzyme genes according to the Target Development Level (TDL) classification revealed numerous enzymes for which inhibitors are already available. We next explored underexpression events to identify potential synthetic lethal targets. Intriguingly, we found that CRC models lacking expression of the MTAP gene were sensitive to treatment with an inhibitor of the PRMT5:MTA complex currently under clinical development.<br \/>We found that mapping extreme and transcriptome-wide positive and negative gene expression outliers in CRC cell lines is an effective strategy to identify putative drug targets and biomarkers, independently from the underlying genetic or epigenetic alterations. We indeed present a comprehensive atlas of CRC extreme gene expression outliers which includes events with diagnostic or therapeutic relevance. This resource could also serve as a reference for further discoveries in CRC and other tumour types.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-01 Analytic pipeline optimization,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Gene expression,Targeted therapy,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Gaia Grasso<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elisa Marriella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Martina Miotto<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kristi Buzo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Nicole M.

A multitude of natural and artificial sources of UV exposure exist, including UV-emitting lamps that are commonly used in dentistry, cosmetics, and medical laboratories. Recently, several reports suggested that long-term use of UV-nail polish dryers, used for curating nail polish formulas, known as gel, may increase the risk for developing skin cancer. However, no experimental evaluation has been conducted to reveal the effect of radiation released by UV-nail polish dryers on mammalian cells. Here, we address the continuous exposure of clients and employees to UVA light by employing both murine and human primary cell models for irradiation, in an acute and chronic manner, using a UV-dryer machine. We, then, subject the cells to DNA sequencing either by bulk whole-genome sequencing after clonal expansion or by single-molecule duplex sequencing without clonal expansion. Our findings show that UVA-exposed samples manifest an increase of C:G&#62;A:T transversions compared to control cells. The patterns of mutations found in these cells can be recapitulated by mutational signatures previously attributed to reactive oxygen species (ROS), namely COSMIC signatures SBS18\/36. These results are further corroborated by the presence of high levels of ROS in irradiated samples, consistent with 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine damage and mitochondrial dysfunction. Importantly, we show that in contrast to UVB exposure, UVA does not induce an increase of C:G&#62;T:A transitions, indicating that different types of ultraviolet light radiation affect DNA through distinctive molecular mechanisms. Finally, re-examination of somatic mutations from skin cancers reported by the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) reveals that SBS18\/36 are ubiquitously present in melanoma and account for 12% of the previously annotated driver mutations. In summary, this study demonstrates that radiation emitted by UV-nail polish dryers can both damage DNA and permanently engrave mutations on the genomes of mammalian cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mutagenesis,Ultraviolet radiation,Skin carcinogenesis,Stress response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Maria Zhivagui<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Areebah Hoda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Noelia Valenzuela<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yi-yu Yeh<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Dai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yudou He<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shuvro P.

Here we describe how the integration of transcriptomics and kinase activity data lead to a better characterization of various cancer models.<br \/>Methods: We performed RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and kinase activity profiling of 63 Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) models from six tumor types (Breast, Ovarian, Colon, Melanoma, Lung and Acute Myeloid Leukemia, AML). RNAseq was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq platform. The data was DESeq2-normalized and log2-transformed. Protein Tyrosine Kinase and Serine-Threonine Kinase activities were profiled on PamChip&#174; peptide microarray. To identify the role of kinase signaling related genes we defined a set of signaling-specific genes (n=2932), based on the elements from the reactome signal transduction pathway database (n=2560) and additional kinases (n=372) represented on Pamchip, that was used for further analysis. Integrated analysis of transcriptomics and kinase activity data was performed using Multi Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA).<br \/>Results: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of RNAseq data using all included genes or 2932 kinase signaling-specific genes showed clustering of the data according to cancer type, with ovarian cancer showing most heterogeneity, which indicates the importance of kinase signaling in these malignancies. Interestingly, with integrated RNAseq-Kinase activity data all except ovarian cancer show clustering of cancer types on the MOFA Factor 1 - Factor 3. Pathway analysis on the highest ranking 100 genes from principal component 1 of RNAseq data (capturing variation between AML and the other tumor types) resulted in 60 KEGG pathways. Importantly, highest ranking 50 genes and 47 peptides comprising MOFA Factor1 identified 115 significant KEGG pathways, and the statistical score of pathways identified by RNAseq alone was further improved. Finally, significant correlation between gene expression and kinase activity was found for selected PDX model per malignancy. Furthermore, ranking PDX models based on correlation score provided suitable tool to select PDX models for disease or pathway specific research question.<br \/>Conclusion: Integrating transcriptomics with kinase activity data can be used to confirm transcriptomics findings on a functional level and provides deeper biological insights than transcriptomics alone. We show that integrative analysis leads to more significant and a higher number of enriched pathways. High correlation between two datasets allows for selecting animal models addressing specific research questions. Integrated analysis of transcriptomics and kinase activity data has great potential in improving diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of response to treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Kinases,Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models,RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq),Signal transduction pathways,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Dóra Schuller<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rik De Wijn<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dirk Pijnenburg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tobias Deigner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Julia Schueler<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Simar Pal Singh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

Here, we provide new stemness indices for assessing the degree of oncogenic dedifferentiation in tumor samples. We used a machine learning model to predict the stemness molecular phenotype based on proteomic data. The prediction model was built from human pluripotent stem cell from the Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Consortium (HipSci) and applied to compute stemness indices on the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) tumor samples, consisting in their proteogenomic hallmarks of stemness. The obtained stemness scores based on protein expression are novel and original, and are significantly more robust compared to our previous published work. The obtained proteomic score is able to classify stem cells and non-stem cell classes. The initial analysis of over 2000 tumor samples obtained from twelve types of primary carcinomas of breast, ovary, lung, kidney, uterus, brain (pediatric and adult), head and neck, liver, stomach, colon, and pancreas has confirmed our previously published results. Indexing of CPTAC tumors with proteomic stemness score brought us with previously unappreciated findings. We integrated the stemness scores computed using proteins with gene expression, DNA methylation, microRNA, copy number alteration and protein post-translational modification to identify coherent proteogenomic stemness association. Our initial findings identified proteins and phospho-proteins as active nodes of signaling pathways and transcriptional networks that drive aggressiveness of the primary tumors that cause resistance to existing therapies. The correlation between stemness scores and protein expression resulted in the identification of potential drug targets for anti-cancer therapy both tumor-specific and shared among different tumor types. Our results also revealed stemness-associated proteins predictive of clinical outcome across analyzed tumor types. Finally, we validated some stemness targets by immunohistochemistry in independent samples and confirmed the association with clinical outcome. Targeting the proteins here identified and cellular mechanisms that drive a stemness phenotype with existing or novel drugs may eventually lead for clinical development of effective cures for cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Stemness,Machine learning,Proteomics,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Tathiane M.

While CAR-T has yielded tremendous clinical success for patients with liquid tumors, its potential remains to be unleashed against solid tumors. One key challenge is identifying optimal targets for these therapies: cell surface proteins that are expressed highly and uniformly by a tumor&#8217;s constituent malignant cells, and minimally so by healthy tissues. Employing a systematic, data-driven analysis, we first charted the landscape of existing CAR-T targets in the clinic, identifying the leading targets in each indication based on tumor selectivity and safety metrics. Next, from patient tumor single cell transcriptomics data, we performed a genome wide search across many different solid tumor types to identify new and candidate CAR-T targets with better selectivity and safety scores than extant ones. Remarkably, in almost all indications, we could not find such better targets, testifying to the near optimality of the current target space, at least in accordance with our measures. However, one striking exception is HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), for which there is currently a dearth of existing CAR-T targets in clinics. Specifically, our investigation has discovered 20 novel CAR-T targets for treating HNSC and one for treating glioblastoma more precisely and safely.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,CAR T cells,Cancer immunotherapy,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sanna Madan<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sanju Sinha<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alejandro A.

The third-generation inhibitor osimertinib, the current standard of care, is still prone to resistance. Combined with the failure of several late-stage candidates it is clear a novel approach is required. We have developed a transomic analysis platform, PROSPER (Protein Regulation with Objective Seeking Powerful Evidence Retrieval), employing an integrated analysis of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics, termed transomics. This proprietary analysis allows us to interpret complex biological relationships and provide a functional map of the biochemical drivers of disease. We investigated the effects of a cross-section of EGFRi in a panel of EGFR mutant lung cancer cell lines and performed a transomics analysis to identify key differences between different EGFRi and drive novel drug discovery to circumvent resistance to EGFR-targeted drugs. Seven drugs, both approved and unapproved EGFRi, were evaluated against three NSCLC cell lines. The cell lines expressed wild-type EGFR (as a control), Ex19del activating mutation (to model EGFR mutant NSCLC), or L858R activating mutation plus T790M gatekeeper mutation (to model a subtype of EGFRi resistant NSCLC). Approved drugs included erlotinib, afatinib (first- and second-generation EGFRi, respectively), and osimertinib (third-generation drug that can overcome the T790M gatekeeper mutation that confers resistance to earlier drugs). The remaining drugs (maverlertinib, naquotinib, olmutinib, rociletinib) are unapproved third-generation inhibitors. The concentration required to inhibit cell growth (IC<sub>50<\/sub>) was determined after a 72 h incubation and viability was assessed by CellTiter-Glo. For the transomic analyses, the same drugs were incubated for 24 h with the IC<sub>50<\/sub> concentration and cells were harvested for genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses. The subsequent analysis revealed striking differences between the seven drugs. Principal component analysis shows two distinct clusters between approved and unapproved drugs. Furthermore, the transomic signature for the third-generation approved drug osimertinib was significantly different to that for the drug olmutinib which failed clinical development due to toxicity. Transomic analysis of EGFRi has the potential to identify important differences between successful drugs, drugs that failed in clinical development, and to identify non-EGFR targets that may overcome resistance to current drugs. This hypothesis is currently being investigated across various resistant and undruggable cancers to unlock novel therapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Proteomics,NSCLC,EGFR TKI resistance,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Christopher J.

To do this, we aim to establish a rad-age association using genomics as its foundation and clinical applicability with lung disease as an overlapping health concern.<br \/>Methods: Two datasets were combined and used to empirically find the age cutoff between young and old patients: GSE42488 (Data-A1) and GSE53351 (Data-A2). With age as both a categorical and continuous variable, two other datasets that include radiation exposure are used to test the interaction between radiation and age: GSE21240 (Data-B1) and GSE23515 (Data-B2). A radiation only data was also used in conjunction to evaluate trend analysis with increasing exposure levels: GSE20173 (Data-R1). The gene lists are oriented in preranked lists for both pathway and diseases functional analysis. Finally, these genes are used to evaluate another dataset via GSE42834 (Data-D1) on the clinical relevance in differentiating lung diseases given ethnicity and sex using both pairwise t-tests and linear models including pneumonic, tuberculosis, active and non-active sarcoidosis, lung cancer, and healthy controls.<br \/>Results: Using 12 well-known genes associated with aging, a threshold of 29 years old was found to be the difference between young and old patients. The two interaction tests (rad and age as continuous plus rad and age as categorical) yielded 234 unique genes such that pathway analysis flagged IL-1 signaling and PRPP biosynthesis as significant with high cell proliferation diseases and carcinomas being a common trend. From the radiation only t-tests, we see a trend of continued upregulation in gene expression as radiation levels increase in 15 of the 17 common genes. When looking at pairwise comparison of disease, ethnicity, or sex, 10 genes were statistically significant, 3 of which had a combination of pairwise significance and fold-change, while <i>LAPTM4B<\/i> (probe identifier ILMN1680196) was the only gene with significant interaction (p-value=0.004) between lung disease, ethnicity, and sex and fold change greater than two.<br \/>Conclusion: The results corroborate an initial association between radiation and age given inflammation and metabolic pathways and multiple genes emphasizing mitochondrial function, oxidation, and histone modification. Being able to tie rad-age genes to lung disease supplements a geroscience approach in future work.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Aging,Genomics,Ionizing radiation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Nathan A.

High-throughput mutagenesis is emerging as a powerful tool to probe the varying consequences of different amino acid substitutions across the length of a protein or protein domain, however it is currently limited to specific functional readouts such as target protein abundance or functional assays. Studying the effects of genetic perturbations on cellular programs and fitness has been challenging using traditional pooled screens. Over the last few years, there has been a surge of interest in Perturb-seq style assays to measure the transcriptional consequences of genetic perturbations ranging from whole gene knockout to amino acid substitutions in single cells. While providing greater function insight, these sequencing-based methods are not yet scalable to exhaustive mutagenesis, necessitating selection of target mutations. In this work, we hypothesized that examining the consequences of perturbing distinct protein interactions could provide a useful abstraction of the phenotypic space reachable by individual amino acid substitutions. To explore this hypothesis, we employed a Perturb-seq style approach to generate mutations at physical interfaces of the transcription factor RUNX1, with the potential to perturb different interactions, and therefore produce transcriptional readouts implicating different aspects of the RUNX1 regulon. We analyzed these readouts to identify functionally distinct groups of RUNX1 mutations, characterize their effects on cellular programs and study the implications for cancer mutations. Our work demonstrates the potential of targeting protein interaction interfaces to better define the landscape of prospective phenotypes reachable by amino acid substitutions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-02 Application of bioinformatics to cancer biology,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Protein-protein interactions,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kivilcim Ozturk<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca Panwala<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jeanna Sheen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Prashant Mali<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hannah Carter<\/i><\/presenter>.

HIF1A transcriptionally regulates many genes in key processes like angiogenesis and metastasis, facilitating the cell&#8217;s survival. Interestingly, HIF1A is able to carry out its regulatory functions by forming protein-protein interactions with its co-transcription factors. Since low oxygen conditions are frequently present in cancerous cells, we predict that these co-transcription factors could serve as new cancer therapeutic targets. Our recent work has thus focused on identifying motifs in HIF1A ChIP-Seq sequences and discovering novel HIF1A co-transcription factors. In this study, we leveraged cutting-edge deep learning methods, including a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) based motif-discovery model, and discovered several novel motifs. We also look to predict potential therapeutic drugs against the identified co-transcription factors using a machine-learning drug discovery model that evaluates therapies based on their half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). We have so far found several small molecules that could adequately modulate the activity of the identified co-transcription factors. Our results could lead to new therapeutic approaches against HIF1A-dependent cancers such as colon, breast, gastric, lung, brain, and prostate.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcription factor,Hypoxia-inducible factor,Machine learning,Drug discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Yuxiang Zhang<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Saidi Wang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Haiyan Hu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaoman Li<\/i><\/presenter>.

Preoperative MRI can be used to initial diagnosis, and surgery planning, while follow-up MRIs can be used to evaluate treatment responses, identify recurrency, and detect side effects. The follow-up MRIs are usually taken after the first-line therapy, such as maximal safe resection. In the past, radiologists manually segment the tumor regions from normal brain tissue on follow-up MRIs, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and challenging. Several deep-learning (DL) models have been developed utilizing preoperative images, but their performance has yet to be evaluated on follow-up MRIs. In this research, we built the largest follow-up MRI cohort (311 patients) to assess these DL models and their generalizability and performance on independent preoperative and follow-up images. We also made the first follow-up-based deep learning models for this specific task.<br \/>Methods: All evaluation deep learning models (10 models) were trained by the Brain Tumor Segmentation challenge 2020 (BraTS&#8217;20) and evaluated by fifty pairs of preoperative and follow-up scans from our institution. The segmentation form our institution is evaluated by board certified radiologist. MRIs in the BraTS&#8217;20 dataset were all preoperative scans. After the evaluation, we randomly assigned 264 patients&#8217; scans from our institution to the training dataset and 47 patients&#8217; scans to the testing dataset. We compared three types of models in our follow-up deep learning model, including 1) UNet-3D, 2) UNet-3D+transfer-learning, and 3) UNet-3D+transfer-learning+baysian-learning. The benchmark for all models was the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). DSC can measure the spatial overlap between model prediction and ground truth. The value of DSC is between zero to one. Zero means no overlap and one indicates complete overlap.<br \/>Results: Our study demonstrates that the BraTS'20 trained models' performance decreased by 13.05% in independent preoperative MRI scans and 19.04% in follow-up MRI scans. The most significant mismatch regions were FLAIR hyperintense regions (3.68% drop in independent preoperative scans and 10.61% drop in independent follow-up scans ) and Non-enhancing core (5.20% drop in independent preoperative scans and 11.99% drop in independent follow-up scans ). Our best model can achieve the best DSC among three tumor regions compared to all evaluation models (FLAIR hyperintense regions: DSC 0.77 V.S. DSC 0.58; Enhancing tumor region: DSC 0.87 V.S. DSC 0.68; Non-enhancing tumor region: DSC 0.92 V.S. DSC 0.55 ).<br \/>Conclusion: Maximal safe resection induced brain structure change, decreasing the performance of the preoperative-based DL model. Implementing a follow-up MRI-based segmentation model is essential to make accurate and generalizable results to address structural changes after maximal safe resection. Our follow-up DL model demonstrates the DSC score can be recovered. We commit to further developing the tool to assist radiologists in handling follow-up MRIs for glioblastoma patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain tumors,Deep learning,Magnetic resonance imaging,Machine learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Kang Lin Hsieh<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tanjida Kabir<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Luis Nunez-Rubiano<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu-Chun Hsu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yu Cai<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Juan Rodriguez Quintero<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Octavio Arevalo<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kangyi Zhao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jackie Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jiguang Zhu Zhu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Roy Riascos<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xioaqian Jiang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shayan Shams<\/i><\/presenter>.

However, the associations between hits on screens and candidate drugs have been unclear, and a manual approach to directly infer drug candidates from &#8220;druggable&#8221; candidates suffers from its laborious, ad hoc investigation and low accuracy. Here, we describe a systematic approach to explore the associations between genetic dependencies and drug sensitivity of cancer cell lines and to identify potential drug repositioning opportunities. We first developed drug sensitivity predictive models trained on genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout viability profiles and large-scale drug response screens of 4,518 drugs from DepMap. We obtained the highest predictive power from the decision-tree-based models and observed previously reported associations between gene perturbation and drug response. For example, cancer cells that are more sensitive to <i>TP53<\/i> or <i>MDM2<\/i> perturbation were more sensitive to MDM inhibitors, and <i>EGFR<\/i> or <i>ERBB2<\/i> dependency strongly predicted the sensitivity of cells to EGFR inhibitors. Interestingly, for 3,260 drugs with known targets, only 1.5% of these genes were selected as top features to predict drug sensitivity, indicating that genes that are not the direct targets of drugs should be considered. In addition, we applied our models to the CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens that target 1,805 &#8220;druggable&#8221; genes and predicted the sensitivity of cancer cells to known and novel drugs. Furthermore, we were able to validate the candidate drugs using cell viability assays. Finally, a multi-class classification deep learning model, based on the TorchDrug framework, reaches higher recall values than a decision-tree-based method but with much lower precision values. Our study provided the first systematic evaluation between large-scale gene dependency and drug responses. The machine learning predictive model provides an in-silico approach to perform drug screens from functional genetic screens.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug sensitivity,Machine learning,CRISPR\/Cas9,Modeling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Bicna Song<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lumen Chao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Xiaolong Cheng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Yuan Gao<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ruocheng Shan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Wei Li<\/i><\/presenter>.

Further, the validation of the model was conducted using external clinicopathological dataset of 20 patients from Dartmouth-Hitchcock (DH) Medical center which yielded AUC&#62;0.75.<br \/>Conclusion: Random Forest model trained using grid search through tree-depth hyperparameter can predict distant recurrence flags (Yes or No) in invasive breast cancer patients at AUC in the range of 0.75 1.0 across multiple institutions, thereby aiding portability of models and advancing the idea of multi-instutional ML\/AI model validations in Invasive Breast Carcinoma subtype of Breast Cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Machine learning,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Shrey S.

We combined advances in high content microscopy with arrayed CRISPR genome editing techniques and machine learning (ML) to build a rigorously controlled dataset enabling exploration of biology and chemistry at scale. Phenotypes from millions of perturbations in multiple cell types were embedded in a unified representation space and leveraged to accelerate discovery and reverse translation, ultimately yielding novel biological insights, and optimizing the advancement of lead molecular series through structure-activity relationships (SAR). Here, we demonstrate the capability of our platform to discover potential cancer therapies with distinct mechanisms of action. First, we describe the identification of a novel compound series that potentiates the effects of immunotherapy in syngeneic mouse models, producing complete responses and immunological memory, while also limiting peripheral inflammation. Specific novel chemical entities (NCEs) caused robust CD45+ cell influx into the tumor microenvironment and significantly attenuated exhausted T cells and immunosuppressive macrophages, thereby enhancing anti-tumor immunity. Strikingly, the same NCEs suppressed peripheral inflammation while sustaining elevated levels of intra-tumoral proinflammatory cytokines. Second, we highlight a novel and differentiated strategy to potentiate PARP inhibitor response in homologous repair deficient (HRD) - negative or HR-proficient ovarian cancers. NCEs altered the expression of genes within the DNA damage repair (DDR) network and cell cycle checkpoints to synergize with PARP inhibition <i>in vivo <\/i>and re-sensitized a PARP-resistant patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. Collectively, we believe future efforts on the industrialization and integration of various technological innovations across biology, chemistry, automation, data science, and engineering will ultimately modernize drug discovery and radically improve patient lives.&nbsp;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Machine learning,PARP inhibitors,Immunotherapy,CRISPR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Jenny Rudnick<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kiran Nadella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chase Neumann<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shane Rowley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ethan Gardner<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Shadi Swaidani<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aimee Iberg<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lu Chen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daria Beshnova<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aurora Blucher<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Rebecca Sarto Basso<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Malini Rajan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin Fales<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashraf Saeed<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Christopher Bailey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Weston Judd<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chrissy Egbert<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Joel Ellis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Ansede<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Pouya Hadipour<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Kevin Jessing<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Janet Paulsen<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Paul Rearden<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vamshi Manda<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sashi Kasimsetty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sashi Kasimsetty<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Hancock<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Harish Shankaran<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Bryan Ellis<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Meenakshy Iyer<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Carl Brooks<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ashish Bhandari<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Chris Gibson<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Irit Rappley<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Laura Schaevitz<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Imran Haque<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Hayley Donnella<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Cuccarese<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Marie Evangelista<\/i><\/presenter>.

Research using large-scale genomic and other-omics data is no longer limited by storage space or slow downloading speed for individual datasets. Innovations like cloud infrastructure enable computing over many datasets at multiple locations at once. These developments have increased the need for faster, more efficient processes for data access and sharing. To support scientific exploration and meet the demand for analysis of biomedical data, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has created two large collections of the broad-use studies within the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP). These collections comply with the consent of the study (data use limitations) for how secondary access to studies are determined. <u>NCI&#8217;s Collection of Datasets for General Research Use<\/u> comprises 284 studies with individual-level data sets, and permits approved users to explore broad research interest, including methods and tool development. <u>NCI&#8217;s Collection of Datasets for Health, Medical, and Biomedical (HMB) Research Purposes<\/u> is comprised of 65 studies of individual-level that are permitted for research interests specific to any health, medical, or biomedical research only. The HMB collection could be used for methods and tool development; research interests involving ancestry\/populations studies must be dependent on a health\/medical condition. Through these collections, investigators will have the potential to add access to 349 datasets to their approved research projects or submit a new project request for access to the broad-use collections. As new genomic studies are registered by NCI for release through dbGaP, they will be automatically added to these collections. NCI anticipates through the implementation of these broad-use collections a requestor could have access to approximately 70% of NCI&#8217;s studies in controlled-access repositories.The streamlined access to broad-use datasets expedites data sharing and potentially accelerates the discovery process.

The challenge is that, for the majority of cancers, we do not understand the relationship between the genetic alterations and the dependencies they cause. To solve this problem, we are creating a Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) by systematically identifying genetic dependencies and small molecule sensitivities as well as discovering the biomarkers that predict them. Since its inception, DepMap has compiled data for over eighteen hundred cell line models, performed more than a thousand CRISPR screens, and drug sensitivity profiles using PRISM in over 500 cell lines as well as developed new analytic methods for the identification of cancer vulnerabilities. DepMap is being used by researchers around the world and numerous potential therapeutic targets have been identified using this resource. However, we are still in the early stages of having a complete map and we will discuss our ongoing work towards making the Cancer Dependency Map more powerful. The next generation DepMap will include more complex cellular models including 3D models, representing pediatric and rare cancers, and expanding the perturbation space to include combinations. Additionally, we are performing novel types of omics characterization and building new computational and visualizations tools.

Despite this mutational load of often thousands of deleterious mutations, many tumors thrive. How tumors survive the damaging consequences of this mutational load is not well understood. Here, we investigate the functional consequences of mutational load in 10,295 human tumors by quantifying their phenotypic response through changes in gene expression. Using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), we find that high mutational load tumors up-regulate proteostasis machinery related to the mitigation and prevention of protein misfolding. We replicate these expression responses in cancer cell lines and show that the viability in high mutational load cancer cells is strongly dependent on complexes that degrade and refold proteins. This indicates that upregulation of proteostasis machinery is causally important for high mutational burden tumors and uncovers new therapeutic vulnerabilities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-05 Integrative computational approaches,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Expression analysis,Bioinformatics,Mutations,Therapeutic target,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Susanne Tilk<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Judith Frydman<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Dmitri Petrov<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Christina Curtis<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>.

This technology has the potential to provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer progression and could be particularly useful in identifying specific regional cancer progression. By studying the regional spatial trajectory of cancer progression, we can develop more targeted therapies and better predict the likelihood of metastasis. Additionally, analyzing gene expression patterns in specific regions of the tissue can reveal the molecular mechanisms driving cancer growth in those areas, potentially uncovering new therapeutic targets.<br \/>In this study, we created a spatial trajectory analysis method, named as stLearn - PSeudo-Time-Space (PSTS) algorithm, to investigate specific regional cancer progression. Spatial trajectory analysis is a statistical method that allows for the identification of patterns of transitional gene expression over time and space within a tissue sample. In detail, this method incorporates spatial features, such as tissue sub-structure locations and gene expression changes, to model the trajectory from a single snapshot of transcriptomics data. Also, we evaluated the effectiveness of PSTS by utilizing the cancer progression model in human breast cancer samples.<br \/>Using this approach, we were able to identify specific regions within the breast tissue that displayed distinct progression branching trajectories patterns of transitional gene expression associated with ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive ductal carcinoma.

Our prior work has resulted in successful error suppression for substitutions (10<sup>-4<\/sup>-10<sup>-5<\/sup>). However, the error profiles of indels and structural variants (SVs) remain elusive.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> In this work, we generated ultra-deep sequencing data using our previously established dilution models (COLO829) on known somatic indels (n=23) and SVs (n=17). We discovered that the error rate of indels (10<sup>-6<\/sup>) and SVs (&#60;2&#215;10<sup>-7<\/sup>) are 100- to &#62;1000-fold lower than that of SNVs. This finding was fully recapitulated in our analysis of 347 indels and 1248 SVs discovered from a relapsed B-ALL cohort of 103 patients, although homopolymer indels can have high error rates (&#62;1%). We then performed a comprehensive study of homopolymer indels in 361 cancer driver genes by using whole genome data from 1662 healthy donors from the SJLIFE cohort. Our data indicated that the number of repeating units are highly predictive relative to the error rate of homopolymer indels (R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.988, p=4.89&#215;10<sup>-8<\/sup>). Utilizing these insights, we assayed end-of-induction remission samples from 72 B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia patients that relapsed by selecting ~5 somatic clonal SNV\/Indel\/SV markers, which confirmed that SVs and indels have &#62;10-fold lower error rates than SNVs. Our next generation sequencing (NGS) approach had 44 positive detections (61%) and outperformed the current standard method of clinical flow cytometry (n=37; 51%) for detecting minimal residual disease. The NGS-based method detected 92% of designed markers for samples with MRD&#62;0.3%, and this detection rate dropped to 27% for MRD between 0.1% and 0.01%, indicating the difficulty in recovering mutant molecules when their frequencies are very low.<br \/><b>Conclusions:<\/b> Overall, we established indel and SV error profiles in deep next generation sequencing data enabling superior tumor detection performance at very low burdens, with lower error rates than what is observed for SNVs.

Sarcomas comprise two broad genomic classes: (1) simple karyotypes, where a single oncogenic structural variant (SV) clonally expands a subtype that is diagnostic and relevant to tumor burden tracking; and (2) complex karyotypes, genomic instability, where SVs continuously arise throughout tumor evolution resulting in heterogeneous cellular subtypes. Class two sarcomas are harder to characterize using genome sequencing because there may be multiple low-frequency mutations. In both genomic classes, accurate and sensitive detection of fusion transcripts is needed to interpret functional consequences, to understand tumor biology and evolution, and potentially identify new targets for therapy. Many fusions have complex structures that cannot be uniquely resolved using short reads due to a lack of exon connectivity. PacBio full-length RNA isoform sequencing resolves complex fusions, providing more accurate breakpoints, and a complete sequence readout of the associated fusion transcript. To date, long-read fusion detection software was designed for high-error sequencing. PacBio HiFi data provides both full-length transcripts and accurate base calls. Here we present a fusion detection tool, pbfusion, specifically designed for HiFi sequence data, and apply it to sarcoma patients from both classes.<br \/>pbfusion converts mapped sequences (either HiFi reads or Iso-Seq isoforms) into transcript objects that are annotated with reference gene models. Annotations determine whether transcripts are discordantly mapped, overlap differing genes, strand swap, transcriptional readthrough, or contain novel exons. The discordant exonic boundaries are treated as breakpoints between two genomic locations. All breakpoints are clustered with a multi-directional chaining algorithm and annotated with exonic information, gene names, and quality information.<br \/>To test our method, we applied pbfusion to twelve samples from 8 sarcoma patients from both genomic classes. We discovered the known and novel fusions, including validated driver events in the fusion-driven samples (e.g. ASPSCR1-TFE3 in alveolar soft part sarcoma and SS18-SSX2\/1 fusion in synovial sarcoma). This approach demonstrates the utility of HiFi sequence data for identification of fusion transcripts in patient samples, and the use of pbfusion in quantifying and annotating these events. pbfusion provides a user-friendly interface, can process a sample in a few minutes, and is freely available to the research community on Bioconda.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-08 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,RNA sequencing,Fusion genes,Sarcoma\/soft-tissue malignancies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Roger Volden<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Zev Kronenberg<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron Gillmor<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ted Verhey<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael Monument<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Donna Senger<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Harsharan Dhillon<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jason Underwood<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elizabeth Tseng<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Daniel Baker<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Primo Baybayan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Michael A.

Newer and more complex datasets are being developed faster than ever, and the resources needed to perform rigorous data analysis have increased dramatically. In spatial transcriptomics analysis, researchers face many technical challenges: data management, compute power, and programming knowledge. In addition to these technical barriers, a constantly evolving field can make it difficult for scientists to understand if they are performing adequate quality control, proper data integration, choosing situationally correct methods, and showing accurate biological insights. Transcriptomics data comes with many meaningful caveats that make having the proper technical resources just a single piece of the puzzle. These obstacles keep scientists with valuable biological questions from maximizing the power of Spatial Transcriptomics. To address these challenges, we developed an end-to-end Visium spatial transcriptomics computational pipeline for generating interactive figures and reports for low-code exploration. This pipeline automated data quality control, batch-effects correction, and multiple peer-reviewed analysis techniques to perform a spatially resolved analysis of tissue heterogeneity. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this pipeline, we performed an analysis on a cohort consisting of 3 patients with adenocarcinoma and 1 patient with signet ring cell carcinoma, each with 1 sample of primary colon tumor and its matched adjacent normal tissue. All samples were formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) provided by BioChain Institute. The tissue sections were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin, and the transcriptome was mapped using 10x Genomics Visium Spatial Gene Expression for FFPE. The raw base call files were then processed into feature-barcode matrices, followed by quality control measures that included data filtering, sample integration, batch-effect removal, and normalization. The pipeline then combined multiple analysis methods for feature extraction from genes and spatial spots, including clustering, neighborhood detection, and gene module detection. Further, we leveraged clinical metadata to perform differential expression and abundance analyses of the extracted features across different tissue and disease types. The pipeline finally generated an interactive report detailing analysis of spatially-resolved tissue biology, pathology, and microenvironment, allowing a scientist to analyze and explore the data further. This pipeline to identified differences in the spatial arrangement between tumor and normal tissue, in addition to demonstrating the spatial arrangements that differentiate adenocarcinoma and signet ring cell carcinoma relating to the invasive front and body of the tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-08 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><i>Steven Hamel<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Elim Cheung<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Ying Qu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Malachi Loviska<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><u><i>Aaron Mayer<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Lutong Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Tong Lu<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Vidyodhaya Sundaram<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Baowen Zhang<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Aaron Chiou<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Honesty Kim<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Matthew Bieniosek<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Alex Trevino<\/i><\/presenter>.

Notably, pan-cancer analyses have revealed that both simple and complex forms of structural variation are pervasive across diverse human cancers, and often underpin drug resistance and metastasis. To date, the study of cancer genomes has relied on the analysis of short-read WGS on the dominant Illumina platform, which generates short, highly-accurate reads of 100-300bp that allow the study of point mutations at high resolution. However, detection of structural variants (SVs) using short reads is limited, as breakpoints falling in repetitive regions cannot be reliably mapped to the human genome. As a result, our understanding of the patterns and mechanisms underpinning structural variation in cancer genomes remains incomplete.<br \/>In contrast to short-read sequencing, long-read sequencing technologies, such as Oxford Nanopore and PacBio, permit continuous reading of individual DNA molecules over 10 kilobases, thus providing unparalleled information to resolve SVs in repetitive regions and complex genome rearrangements. However, novel bioinformatics methods that account for the higher error rate of long-read methods are needed to take advantage of their capabilities for cancer genome analysis.<br \/>Here, we present SAVANA, a novel structural variant caller for long-read sequencing data specifically designed for the analysis of cancer genomes. To identify both somatic and germline SVs, SAVANA takes as input long-read WGS data from a tumor and normal sample pair. SAVANA scans sequencing reads to detect split reads and gapped alignments, which are then clustered to define putative SVs. Next, SAVANA applies a machine learning-informed set of heuristics to remove false positives arising from mapping errors and sequencing artifacts.<br \/>Extensively validated against a multi-platform truthset, we show that SAVANA identifies a range of somatic rearrangements with high recall and precision, outperforming existing tools while maintaining a lower execution time than competing methods. In patient samples, SAVANA identifies clinically relevant alterations, such as oncogenic gene fusions, with high accuracy. Additionally, SAVANA permits the reconstruction of double minutes, multi-chromosomal chromothripsis events, and SVs mapping to highly repetitive regions, including centromeres. In sum, SAVANA permits the characterization of complex structural variants and can uncover clinically relevant mutations across diverse cancer types with high accuracy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-08 New software tools for data analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Whole genome sequencing,Cancer genomics,Gene fusion,Genomic instability,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Hillary Elrick<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Jose Espejo Valle-Inclan<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Katherine E.

The ability to characterize a broad set of somatic (epi)genomic variations simultaneously, using a single sequencing assay, facilitates cancer research and can help inform treatment.<br \/>Here we describe a comprehensive approach to analyze native tumor DNA with long nanopore reads. First, we demonstrate that shallow (&#60;1x) whole genome nanopore sequencing provides sufficient information to observe large-scale copy number aberrations. This enables rapid and affordable screening of samples with an aim of selecting those that contain variation(s) of potential interest; such samples can then be sequenced to higher coverages for a higher resolution picture of specific structural variants.<br \/>We further demonstrate an analysis workflow vimba for high coverage (&#62;30x) nanopore sequencing of tumor\/normal datasets that detects clone- and haplotype-resolved structural variations in patient-derived research samples. We provide an example of haplotype- and breakpoint-resolved compounded amplification and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of a region containing the EGFR gene in an admixed kidney tumor sample.<br \/>Finally, we describe the suitability of this assay to gather genome-wide (epi)genomic variations (e.g., SNPs, indels, SVs, microsatellite instability) across tumor samples of different cancer types. For the first time with native long nanopore reads we are able to capture 5mC and 5hmC methylation information and map it over some of the most challenging repetitive regions of the genome. This information can empower a better understanding of cancer-type-specific (epi)genomic alterations, which in turn can help map out the landscape for further research.<br \/>Our approach demonstrates how nanopore sequencing can be used as a single comprehensive platform to better understand and resolve the complexity of (epi)genomic somatic alterations in tumor samples.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-09 Sequence analysis,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Methylation,Somatic mutations,Nanopore sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Sergey Aganezov<\/i><\/u><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Philipp Rescheneder<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>John Beaulaurier<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Phillip James<\/i><\/presenter>, <presenter><i>Sissel Juul<\/i><\/presenter>.

A large body of literature has investigated these parameters with unique setups and limited cell varieties. The technical challenge of the technique coupled with the uncertainty in the breadth of data has limited the commercialization and widespread adoption of DEP for biological applications. The work presented here aims to evaluate a range of prior applications of DEP on a standardized platform. A variety of cell types were characterized and compared to literature values considering variables such as frequency, voltage, and flow rate. Once a cell type&#8217;s frequency response curve is generated, it is possible to design workflows to enrich that cell type from a bulk mixture, without antibody labeling. Here, we test various cell types and characteristics on a microfluidics-based, benchtop cell sorting technology, the CytoR1. First, the CytoR1 successfully facilitated the separation of ovarian cancer stem cells (CSCs) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), both from mice. From a 56.2% CSCs and 43.8% PMBCs co-culture, we were able to deplete 50% of the PMBCs while retaining the original CSC population. Further work investigated the ability to sort neuron subpopulations. Live neurons can be isolated from a bulk preparation and further enriched by size and phenotype with varying voltage and frequency settings. By modulating voltage and flow rate in addition to frequency, a distinct population of small neurons can be isolated for further study. Finally, cell state can be investigated. Red blood cells were characterized in both their native and oxidatively stressed states. Curves show a distinct shift towards higher frequencies with increasing oxidative stress suggesting the ability to separate these populations from each other. Together these data suggest the versatility of a robust, DEP-based sorting platform, the CytoR1, for label free cell sorting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Late Breaking and Clinical Trials","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-11 Systems engineering,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell lines,Tumor biology,Cancer stem cells,Oxidative stress,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<presenter><u><i>Dean E.
