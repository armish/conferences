[{"Abstract":"Delta-like 1 homolog (DLK-1), a non-canonical notch ligand, is a membrane protein with 6 tandem EGF-like motifs in extracellular region. While the expression of DLK-1 is restricted in some neuroendocrine tissues such as adrenal gland and hypophysis in normal adult tissues, its over-expression in cancers have been reported in a variety of cancer types, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), small cell lung carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, adrenal cortical carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, etc. Interestingly, it has been suggested that DLK-1 is a marker of cancer stem cells in HCC. CBA-1205 is a humanized antibody (IgG1\/&#954;) targeting DLK-1, which is glycoengineered by GlymaxX<sup>&#174;<\/sup> to potentiate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity. CBA-1205 showed no toxicology issues in cynomolgus monkey GLP studies and the Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with solid tumors is under way (JapicCTI-205384). Previously, we demonstrated potent anti-tumor efficacy of CBA-1205 as a monotherapy in multiple human DLK-1 positive cancer xenograft mouse models including HCC (AACR 2019 annual meeting). Lenvatinib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor which has been used for 1<sup>st<\/sup> line therapy of unresectable advanced HCC globally. The purpose of present study is to evaluate the combinatorial efficacy of CBA-1205 with lenvatinib in two HCC xenograft models (Hep3B and HepG2). Hep3B model was sensitive to lenvatinib monotherapy; oral daily dosing of lenvatinib at 3 mg\/kg treatment showed 50% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and at 10 mg\/kg treatment showed more than 80% TGI. In contrast HepG2 model was less sensitive to Lenvatinib; TGI at 3 mg\/kg treatment group was 20 % and that for 10 mg\/kg treatment group was 50 %. When CBA-1205 (1 mg\/kg, twice a week, total 4 times) was intraperitoneally administered in combination with 3 mg\/kg of lenvatinib (daily, total 10 times) in Hep3B xenograft mice, synergistic and long-lasting anti-tumor efficacy was observed compared either with CBA-1205 treatment alone or lenvatinib treatment alone. Tumor growth of all mice (N=8) treated with CBA-1205 and lenvatinib showed almost complete inhibition even 2 weeks after the last dosing. More importantly, 4 out of 8 mice in CBA-1205 and lenvatinib treatment group showed tumor regression. Similar results were obtained with CBA-1205 at 1 mg\/kg dosage in combination with lenvatinib at 10 mg\/kg dosage in HepG2 xenograft model. In conclusion, we demonstrated synergistic and long-lasting anti-tumor efficacy of CBA-1205 in combination with lenvatinib in two different HCC pre-clinical models suggesting that the combination could be a new treatment option for unresectable advanced HCC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC),Preclinical testing,Combination therapy,Hepatocellular carcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Koji Nakamura<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Izumi Sakaguchi<sup><\/sup>, Kota Takahashi<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Chiome Bioscience, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"616aab03-8196-4e54-ab8f-03e14df42c3d","ControlNumber":"879","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;K.

Increasing PDL1 expression on cells may enhance the response to CPIs. Tolllike receptor (TLR) agonists have shown to induce PDL1 expression in the TME and may enhance the antitumor effects of CPIs. The effective dose of TLR agonist administered to patients is limited by systemic toxicities. To overcome this limitation, one approach is to conjugate the TLR agonist to an antibody. This allows for delivery and release of higher doses of the TLR agonist in the TME while limiting systemic exposure.BDB001 is an intravenously (IV) delivered TLR7\/8 dual agonist that activates both the innate and adaptive immune system. In clinical trials, BDB001 has been well tolerated and shown promising antitumor responses in monotherapy and in combination with antiPDL1 therapy (Patel M. et al, SITC 2020 and SITC 2021). To further enhance the antitumor effect and allow for increased concentration of the TLR7\/8 dual agonist in the TME, we developed BDB101, a proprietary firstinclass TLR7\/8 dual agonist - antiPDL1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) conjugate using our TollLike receptor Agonist Conjugate (TLAC) platform. Here we report on the preclinical and nonhuman primate (NHP) evaluation of BDB101.<br \/><b>Methods <\/b>BDB101 utilizes a cleavable linker, allowing for the TLR7\/8 dual agonist payload to be released in the TME and enabling a bystander effect. BDB101 was assessed for in vitro TLR7\/8 dual agonist activity and PDL1 binding, and in vivo antitumor efficacy in immune competent mouse models. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of BDB101 was evaluated in NHP.<br \/><b>Results <\/b>The conjugated TLR7\/8 dual agonist did not change the PDL1 binding specificity of the antibody, and the uncleaved conjugate did not activate TLR7 or TLR8. In the C26 mouse model, a BDB101 mouse surrogate showed a significantly more robust antitumor effect compared to the TLR7\/8 dual agonist or the antiPDL1 mAb alone. In NHP, a single IV infusion of BDB101 showed no significant differences in PK parameters between BDB101 and the total antiPDL1 mAb. BDB101 demonstrated remarkable in vitro stability in human plasma for up to 21 days. In NHP, BDB101 was also very stable with minimal release of free TLR7\/8 dual agonist payload. Pharmacodynamic studies in NHP were consistent with PK behavior.<br \/><b>Conclusions <\/b>BDB101 exhibits robust preclinical efficacy and prolonged stability in NHP. The low rate of free TLR7\/8 dual agonist payload released into the systemic circulation from the conjugated form of BDB101, should minimize the risk of systemic TLR7\/8 dual agonist exposure, while maintaining the ability to deliver the payload to the TME. These results indicate that BDB101 will likely have a good in vivo therapeutic window and strongly support the clinical development of BDB101.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TLR7,PD-L1,Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jing Yang<sup><\/sup>, Robert  H.

However, their application against solid tumors is limited by several challenges, including a narrow therapeutic window due to cytokine release syndrome (CRS) induced toxicity, limited number of functional T cells, and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Engagement of CD28 co-stimulatory domain can promote T cell fitness and sustained activation to overcome T -cell anergy. Here, we describe the development of a novel tri-specific antibody (TsAb) platform which is designed to optimally engage T cells via co-stimulation of both CD3 and of CD28 to achieve more effective tumor cell killing without increased CRS induction. To that end, we identified three selected formats (TsAb-1, TsAb-2 and TsAb-3) based on improved properties of the antibody formats, such as safety, efficacy, stability and developability. These formats have been developed to target three different well-established solid tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) as proof of concept. The binding activity of TsAbs to TAA, CD3 and CD28 was evaluated by ELISA and flow cytometry. Tumor cell cytotoxicity was assessed and secretion of cytokines by immune cells using a tumor cell-PBMC co-culture assay. Effective engagement of CD3 and CD28 was evaluated by flow analysis of CD25 Bcl-xL expression, respectively. Additionally, flow immunophenotyping was performed to characterize the differentiation of memory T cell subsets. Our results show that while all three TsAb formats displayed comparable cytotoxicity, TsAb-3 triggered immune cell activation only upon TAA engagement and T cell synapse formation. TsAb-3 showed &#62; 90% purity, no CRS induction in PBMCs alone or in coculture with low TAA-expressing tumor cells. Additionally, tethered TsAb-3 format was unable to stimulate PBMCs in the absence of TAA. Upon further analysis of T cell phenotype differentiation, TsAb-3 showed enhanced CD25<sup>+<\/sup> T cell activation, Bcl-xL induction and increased T-effector and memory cell phenotypes on day 3 and day 7. In conclusion, our data support further development of TsAb as a versatile and improved T cell engager therapeutics for the treatment of solid malignancies. These versatile formats can be utilized not only in T cell engager therapeutics, but also in rationale combinations with immune check point inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,T cell engager,Costimulation,Solid tumors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Reshmi Nair<sup><\/sup>, Veena Somasundaram<sup><\/sup>, Arvind Goswami<sup><\/sup>, Jaya Bhatnagar<sup><\/sup>, Sourav Paul<sup><\/sup>, Chaitali Dey<sup><\/sup>, Kalyanaraman Vaidyanathan<sup><\/sup>, Rajkumar Paul<sup><\/sup>, Sankar Periasamy<sup><\/sup>, Mary Helen KG<sup><\/sup>, Mahalakshmi NV<sup><\/sup>, Abhishek Sinha<sup><\/sup>, Rachel Salazar<sup><\/sup>, <b>Avanish  K.

Ovarian cancer alone kills 14,000 people each year, and many patients do not respond to currently available treatments. Here we introduce CTIM-76, a CLDN6 T-cell engager antibody as a potential treatment of ovarian, endometrial, and other solid tumors.<br \/>The tight junction protein Claudin 6 (CLDN6) is a validated therapeutic target for many solid tumor types, including ovarian, endometrial, testicular, and gastric. It is differentially expressed on cancer cells with no reported expression in normal, healthy tissue. Despite being an attractive target, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) targeting CLDN6 are difficult to discover due to an abundance of closely related family members and an absolute need for high specificity. The extracellular region of CLDN6 closely resembles the widely expressed family member CLDN9 (3 amino acids different). The few CLDN6 MAbs in clinical development have demonstrated significant binding to other CLDN family members and most have now been halted from further development.<br \/>Starting with a panel of highly specific CLDN6 antibodies, we engineered a large set (&#62; 50) of CLDN6xCD3 bispecific antibodies (CLDN6 bispecifics) using multiple formats and CD3 arms that encompass different geometries and binding stoichiometries, as these factors are expected to play a critical role in the potency of these molecules both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. <i>In vitro<\/i> T cell cytotoxicity and cytokine release assays as well as developability studies were used to select a small panel of antibodies. These were tested <i>in vivo<\/i> and demonstrated efficacy in xenograft studies in PBMC-engrafted mice. From this smaller panel, we chose a lead molecule, CTIM-76 for IND-enabling studies. CTIM-76 shows a combination of potent killing of CLDN6-expressing cells, no killing of cells expressing other closely related claudin family members, and excellent productivity and developability.<br \/>The exquisite specificity of CTIM-76 suggests the potential to address the need for potent therapeutic modalities for ovarian and other cancers without compromising patient safety.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,T cell engager,Endometrial cancer,Claudin,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Joseph Rucker<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ileine Sanchez<sup>1<\/sup>, Kyle Doolan<sup>1<\/sup>, Breanna Tyrell<sup>1<\/sup>, Anna Lobley<sup>1<\/sup>, Nicholas Molino<sup>1<\/sup>, Kristen Shema<sup>1<\/sup>, Kyle Guldner<sup>1<\/sup>, Hayley Roth<sup>1<\/sup>, Alyssa Cunningham<sup>1<\/sup>, Kate Slovik<sup>1<\/sup>, Riley Payne<sup>1<\/sup>, Eric Butz<sup>2<\/sup>, Evan Dick<sup>3<\/sup>, Edward Calamai<sup>3<\/sup>, Ross Chambers<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Integral Molecular, Philadelphia, PA,<sup>2<\/sup>Cascadia Drug Development Group, Philadelphia, PA,<sup>3<\/sup>Context Therapeutics, Philadelphia, PA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6ed512be-0605-4b35-aa16-27f3ab389800","ControlNumber":"3692","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

Infiltration of Tregs in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and a low ratio of effector T cells to Tregs, is frequently associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. The alpha subunit of the IL-2 cytokine receptor (IL2RA), a component of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor along with the &#946; and &#947; subunits (IL2R&#946;&#947;), is constitutively expressed on Tregs and transiently expressed on effector T cells. IL-2 is a key cytokine for effector T cell survival and cytolytic responses. We aimed to discover an IL2RA-targeting antibody capable of depleting Tregs but permitting IL-2 stimulation of effector T cells in the TME. We developed a fully human IgG1 antibody specific to IL2RA, D02, from our proprietary RenMab&#8482; mice, which contain the entire human immunoglobulin variable domain. D02 binds both human and cynomolgus monkey IL2RA with high affinity without hindering IL2RA-IL-2 binding or inhibiting IL-2 signaling. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of D02 <i>in vivo<\/i>, we established a syngeneic mouse tumor model in IL2RA-humanized mice.

Nevertheless only a small portion of population benefited from current ICI treatments, so there should be other mechanisms for immune evasion potentially. The carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) is an activation-induced inhibitory molecule on T and NK cells. In a wide range of cancers, it&#8217;s also expressed on tumor cells and other immune cells including macrophages and neutrophils. Homophilic interaction between CEACAM1 expressed on tumor cells and immune cells dampens NK and T cell function, mediates tumor migration, and promotes tumor angiogenesis, which implies that this homophilic interaction is an important mechanism for tumor progression. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel humanized anti-human CEACAM1 therapeutic antibody developed via Neologics&#8217; novel target validation and antibody screening <i>Tier-A<\/i> platform. This anti-CEACAM1 antibody specifically binds to recombinant human CEACAM1 with nM level affinity and significantly enhances T cell activities and NK killing on CEACAM1 expressing tumor cells, inhibits tumor cell migration in vitro as well. In humanized mouse models, this antibody evidently reduces tumor growth alone or combined with other immune checkpoint blockers. Taken together, we have demonstrated this anti-CEACAM1 antibody specifically enhance NK cell activity, modulate T cell immune activation and inhibit tumor migration supporting further clinical investigation for various indications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,CEACAM1,Monoclonal antibodies,Preclinical,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jinyu Dong<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Yu Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Baiyang Wang<sup><\/sup>, Tingting Pu<sup><\/sup>, Liegang Shao<sup><\/sup>, Binbin Wang<sup><\/sup>, Dong Wang<sup><\/sup>, Jie Ni<sup><\/sup>, Sunan Li<sup><\/sup>, Xin Dong<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>NeoLogics Bioscience Co.

In addition, we confirmed that CNTN4 is highly expressed in the various types of tumors such as gallbladder, pancreas, stomach, endometrium, liver, prostate, and bladder cancer and melanoma with positive rates over 70% through immunohistochemistry analysis. However, murine cancer cells expressed CNTN4 at a very low level, differently from human tumors or cancer cells. Therefore, it was limited in assessing the anti-tumor efficacy by targeting CNTN4 in syngeneic mice models. Following this background, we have prepared CT26 murine cancer cells overexpressing CNTN4 (CT26\/CNTN4) and evaluated anti-tumor efficacy by treating GENA-104A16, the anti-CNTN4 humanized monoclonal antibody in the CT26\/CNTN4 syngeneic mice model. The treatment of GENA-104A16 induced fairly improved <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy in the model compared to the CT26 WT model. Moreover, to identify the<i> in vivo<\/i> immune modulatory function of GENA-104A16, we analyzed the proportion of tumor-infiltrated immune cells in CT26\/CNTN4 tumors through flow cytometry and single-cell analysis. As a result, the population of Treg cells decreased in the tumors of GENA-104A16-treated mice. In addition, the total amount of tumor-infiltrated immune cells increased by 2-fold, CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells by 4-fold, and cytotoxic CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells by 1.5-fold in tumors of mice administrated with GENA-104A16. We also performed transcriptomic analysis on samples collected from IgG-treated CT26 WT tumors and CT26\/CNTN4 tumors treated with IgG or GENA-104A16. Comparative analysis of gene expression using the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis Hallmark showed that the gene sets of TNF&#945; signaling, IFN&#947; response, inflammatory response, and apoptosis were decreased in CT26\/CNTN4 tumors than in CT26 WT tumors. And the majority of the two gene sets, TNF&#945; signaling and IFN&#947; response in CT26\/CNTN4 tumors, increased by the administration of GENA-104A16. These results indicate that the overexpression of CNTN4 reduces the activity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, resulting in decreased cytokine secretion, which is restored by administering GENA-104A16. Furthermore, we investigated <i>in vitro<\/i> T cell-mediated cytotoxicity of GENA-104A16 on U2OS (human osteosarcoma cell) endogenously expressing CNTN4 together with CNTN4-knocked out U2OS. GENA-104A16 increased T cell-mediated cytotoxicity when CNTN4-expressing U2OS cancer cells were co-cultured with T cells. Collectively, the function of CNTN4 in negative immune regulation was confirmed repeatedly through the present studies. And the expression level of CNTN4 on tumors was essential for the anti-tumor activity of GENA-104A16. Therefore, the expression of CNTN4 could be a potential biomarker for monitoring clinical responses to anti-CNTN4 therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Antibody,Immuno-oncology,Preclinical,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mi Young Cha<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Hyunkyung Yu<sup><\/sup>, Bu-Nam Jeon<sup><\/sup>, Youngeun Ha<sup><\/sup>, Hyunuk Kim<sup><\/sup>, Yunyeon Kim<sup><\/sup>, Joo-Yeon Chung<sup><\/sup>, Gihyeon Kim<sup><\/sup>, Changho Park<sup><\/sup>, Kyung Mi Park<sup><\/sup>, Hansoo Park<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Genome & Company, Sungnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d65df5ed-636e-4df8-b0ed-3df0a60a028e","ControlNumber":"1358","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

However, their role in treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is still uncertain. CLL, a clonal disease of mature B cells, is associated with high B\/T cell ratios and diminished T cell activation and function, including the inability to form strong immunosynapses (<i>Ramsay et al, J Clinical Investigation, 2008<\/i>). Herein, we explore whether Mosun could overcome these barriers and elicit strong T-cell mediated B-cell killing in CLL samples.<br \/>Methods: PBMCs from CLL patients and healthy donors were exposed to a titration of Mosun for 48 and 72 hours and analyzed for B cell death with flow cytometry. Markers of T cell activation and exhaustion were quantified in CD4 and CD8T cells and within their CD45RA\/CCR7 subsets. The concentrations of secreted cytokines were measured by ELISA. To study the impact of high B\/T ratio on B cell killing, B cells were isolated from healthy donor PBMC and added back to autologous PBMC to attain B\/T ratios seen in CLL patient samples.<br \/>Results: After 48 hours with 0.04ug\/ml Mosun, the percentage of dead B cells in healthy-donor samples (n=9) exceeded that in CLL samples (n=7) by four-fold (54.2 <u>+<\/u> 17.9 vs: 12.9 <u>+<\/u> 17.5%, p=0.0004). Under the same conditions, significantly more T cells expressed activation markers in healthy donors than in CLL patients, with 58.8 <u>+<\/u>17.1% of healthy donor CD8T cells expressing both CD69 and CD25 compared to and 31.4 <u>+<\/u>21.4% of CLL CD8T cells (p=0.013). The mean concentration of Granzyme B secreted by healthy donor samples upon Mosun treatment was over ten times higher than by CLL patient samples. Reconstitution of a healthy donor sample to a B\/T ratio of 10 resulted in decreased B cell killing (29.7% dead B cells vs: 70.5% in un-reconstituted) without affecting T cell activation (62.9% CD69+CD25+ CD8T cells versus 56.2% in un-reconstituted).<br \/>Conclusions: Although single-agent Mosun treatment can activate T-cells in CLL patient samples and result in B-cell death, the response is suboptimal due to a number of factors, including deficient T cell activation and high B\/T ratio. Ongoing work is focusing on evaluating drug partners to debulk CLL B cells or prime CLL T cells for better B-cell killing by Mosun.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,In vitro,Cancer immunotherapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kathy Barrett<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Kai Lu<sup>1<\/sup>, Hyun Yong Jin<sup>1<\/sup>, Rosie Millen<sup>2<\/sup>, Marcus Lefebure<sup>2<\/sup>, Yanwen Jiang<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Oncology Biomarker Development, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Clinical Science, Roche Products Limited, Welwyn, United Kingdom","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"83e7fd15-1922-474f-9156-55ec5aa16baa","ControlNumber":"2156","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;K.

In recent years, therapies such as anti-CD47 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and SIRP&#945; fusion proteins that target this axis have garnered much attention. Although exciting clinical activities have been observed in hematological cancers, responses in solid tumors are less impressive and often require complex combination strategies.<br \/>We previously described a novel CD47xEpCAM bispecific antibody, VBI&#8209;003, built on a human IgG1 backbone to harness the power of blocking CD47\/SIRP&#945; pathway while preserving the effector functions of IgG1 Fc (J ImmunoTher Cancer 2021;9:doi: 10.1136\/jitc-2021-SITC2021.274). The bispecific design aims to improve selectivity so that SIRP&#945; blocking and stable binding occur selectively on tumor cells where both CD47 and EpCAM are present.<i> In vitro<\/i> studies show that VBI&#8209;003 exhibits minimal red blood cell binding and does not cause hemagglutination, in contrast to benchmark CD47 mAb. VBI&#8209;003 has potent single agent activity in cell line derived xenograft (CDX) models of gastric and esophageal cancers. Here, we further explored the anti-tumor activities of VBI&#8209;003 in areas with great unmet needs such as small cell lung cancers (SCLC) and colorectal cancers (CRC).<br \/>Gene expression analysis from public datasets reveals frequent expression of CD47 and EpCAM in SCLC and CRC tumors. Flow cytometry studies confirmed co-expression of CD47 and EpCAM on SCLC and CRC cell lines. Furthermore, <i>in vitro<\/i> assays showed that VBI-003 has potent EpCAM dependent SIRP&#945; blocking, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activities towards SCLC and CRC cell lines. Moreover, VBI&#8209;003 demonstrated potent single agent activity in multiple CDX models of SCLC with tumor regression and often outperformed benchmark CD47 mAb. Significant tumor growth inhibition was observed in colorectal cancer models post VBI&#8209;003 treatment, with additional activity by combination with standard of care chemotherapies. VBI&#8209;003 synergized with irinotecan and outperformed monotherapy groups in CDX models of CRC. In conclusion, VBI&#8209;003 has potent single agent activity in SCLC tumor models and combined synergistically with irinotecan in CRC models. Our data support further investigation of VBI&#8209;003 as a treatment for CD47 and EpCAM expressing SCLC and CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"CD47,Ep-CAM,Bispecific antibody,Colorectal adenocarcinoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Oi Kwan Wong<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Xinhua Wang<sup><\/sup>, Xiaocheng Chen<sup><\/sup>, Leonard Post<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Virtuoso Therapeutics, Inc., San Mateo, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"053ddff8-7100-455a-9e2b-59b2e7154a9b","ControlNumber":"2592","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;O.

Despite the outstanding improvement in survival with the introduction of anti-HER2 therapies, therapeutic benefit is limited by many resistance mechanisms and toxicities. Clinical trials of therapeutics redirecting T cell activity to HER2+ tumors have highlighted the apparent risk of on-target, off-tumor adverse effects for this target, as HER2 is also expressed in normal epithelia. Using BioAtla&#8217;s Conditionally Active Biologic (CAB) platform, we have developed a HER2 x CAB-CD3 bispecific antibody that was engineered to bind with high affinity to the CD3 receptor and induce T cell activation under conditions that mimic the tumor microenvironment, but with reduced binding in physiological conditions. Both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy data for a CAB T cell engager (TCE) targeting HER2 will be presented. Our data will demonstrate that HER2 x CAB-CD3 bispecific antibody promotes cytotoxicity of HER2+ cancer cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and induces complete regression of tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i>. The HER2 x CAB-CD3 bispecific antibody has higher potency in inducing primary T cell activation measured by means of cytokine release and cancer cell cytotoxicity under acidic conditions compared to the non-CAB benchmark bispecific antibody. The generation of CAB bispecific antibodies with activity in the disease microenvironment minimizes on-target, off-tumor toxicities, thereby enabling higher potency-TCEs for targeting drug resistant, low expressing-HER2+ tumors. In summary, the use of CAB technology expands the universe of targets for drug development by generating a new class of potent CAB T-cell engagers with increased safety margin for potentially enhanced therapeutic indices in the clinic.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor targeting,Conditionally active biologic,Tumor microenvironment,T cell engager,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ana Paula Cugnetti<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Haizhen Liu<sup><\/sup>, Patricia McNeeley<sup><\/sup>, Christina Wheeler<sup><\/sup>, Matthew Lucas<sup><\/sup>, Charles Xing<sup><\/sup>, Solmarie Joyner<sup><\/sup>, Kyrie Johnson<sup><\/sup>, Kathryn Woodard<sup><\/sup>, Wei Zhou<sup><\/sup>, Cathy Chang<sup><\/sup>, Gerhard Frey<sup><\/sup>, William  J.

DLL3 is upregulated in SCLC whereas expression in normal tissues is minimal, representing the favorable profile as a therapeutic target. T cell engager (TCE) is a potent immunotherapy that redirects T cells to tumors expressing a specific antigen. Unlike ICIs, TCEs do not require the recognition of tumor antigens by T cells and thus could be an alternative approach to target tumors where the benefit of ICIs is limited such as SCLC. CD137 (4-1BB) is a costimulatory molecule that promotes T cell activation, proliferation, and survival. Since CD137 agonists synergize with CD3-mediated T cell activation, inducing concurrent CD137 costimulation is a promising strategy to unleash the potential of TCEs. We therefore developed a DLL3\/CD3\/CD137 trispecific T cell engager composed of two CD3\/CD137 dual specific Fabs and one extra DLL3 Fab (DLL3 trispecific, RG6524).<br \/>Results: We initially investigated the CD3 and CD137 signal transduction in Jurkat cells harboring NFAT or NF-&#954;B reporter cocultured with DLL3 positive cells. DLL3 trispecific showed dose-dependent increase in NFAT and NF-&#954;B activity, indicating that target engagement successfully activated CD3 and CD137 signaling. In the in vitro assay using human PBMC, DLL3 trispecific induced cytotoxicity against SCLC cell lines with EC50s in the two-digit pM range.<br \/>In vivo efficacy was evaluated in SCLC xenograft models established by engrafting SCLC cell lines into immune humanized NOG mice. DLL3 trispecific showed greater tumor growth inhibition compared to a traditional bispecific T cell engager. Furthermore, flow cytometry-based immunophenotyping revealed that DLL3 trispecific increased T cell number in tumors and improved IFN-&#947; production from CD8 T cells. We also explored the combination with platinum-based drugs, which are widely used for SCLC, and showed that DLL3 trispecific enhanced the efficacy of platinum-based drugs. These data demonstrated that DLL3 trispecific has the potent in vivo efficacy and the potential for clinical use.<br \/>We next evaluated whether cytokine release syndrome (CRS) mitigating approaches affect antitumor efficacy. Although prophylactic use of a steroid significantly reduced cytokine production, tumor growth inhibition by DLL3 trispecific remained unchanged.

Many HER2-targeted drugs, including trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatinib, trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), and trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), have been approved for treatment of HER2-positive early and metastatic breast cancer (BC). However, trials involving pertuzumab, lapatinib and T-DM1 have failed to provide significant clinical improvements in patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer (GC), suggesting differences in HER2 mediated disease biology between HER2-positive BC and GC. Recent studies have suggested efficacy of HER2 antibodies could be further enhanced by antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) principally regulated by &#8220;don&#8217;t-eat-me&#8221; CD47 signals, which is overexpressed in many HER2-positive cancers and suppresses phagocytosis through binding to SIRP&#945;.<br \/>Methods: BC and GC cell lines were used. Monocytes were isolated from human PBMC and differentiated into macrophages, which were used for <i>in vitro<\/i> ADCP assays. In <i>in vivo <\/i>animal<i> <\/i>experiments, D3L-001 and comparator antibodies were examined for efficacy in solid tumor xenograft models.<br \/>Results: D3L-001 was designed to have higher HER2 affinity (K<sub>D<\/sub> &#60; 1 nM) than that of CD47 (K<sub>D<\/sub> &#62;10 nM). With this unique design, D3L-001 showed preferential binding to HER2\/CD47 double positive tumor cells as compared to CD47 single positive cells. D3L-001 showed better anti-tumor effect than trastuzumab in a panel of solid tumor models, including but not limited to BC and GC cell lines or patient derived xenografts. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis was performed in tumor FFPE slides to evaluate expression of HER2 and CD47 in the efficacy tested models, and we observed that D3L-001 showed broad tumor growth inhibition in HER2 or CD47 high\/low expression models. In both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> studies using breast cancer HCC1954, JIMT-1 and gastric cancer N87 models, we observed a synergistic effect in the combination of Trastuzumab with Magrolimab. Moreover, D3L-001 showed a trend of better efficacy than the combination of Trastuzumab and Magrolimab. These results confirm the synergistic effect of dual-targeting HER2 and CD47 simultaneously and suggest advantage of using bispecific antibodies to confer such effect. D3L-001 also displayed potent and comparable <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy as Enhertu in gastric N87 model, and it showed synergistic <i>in vivo <\/i>efficacy, when combining with Pertuzumab or Paclitaxel, in breast HCC1954, JIMT-1 and gastric cancer N87 models.<br \/>Conclusion: D3L-001, a novel HER2&#215;CD47 bsAb, demonstrated potent anti-tumor effect in a variety of solid tumor models via HER2 guided CD47 co-blocking. It also showed synergistic efficacy when combining with other anti-tumor agents. D3L-001 will be further evaluated in clinic for its potential as a novel treatment option in HER2-positive BC, GC and other solid tumors.<b><\/b><b><\/b>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bispecific antibody,HER2,CD47,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Haopeng Rui<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Xiaofeng Yang<sup><\/sup>, Jiahao Chen<sup><\/sup>, Jia Wang<sup><\/sup>, Zhiqiang Zheng<sup><\/sup>, Zhiqiang Chen<sup><\/sup>, Jingtao Lu<sup><\/sup>, Peggy Wu<sup><\/sup>, Janet Chen<sup><\/sup>, Allison Wang<sup><\/sup>, George Chen<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>D3 Bio (Wuxi) Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"901f2008-59ce-4d55-93e5-8b3963c1e0c6","ControlNumber":"2559","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;H.

However, the clinical application of stimulatory immune checkpoints has been substantially restricted due to their toxicities. MBS307 is a novel first in class PD-L1\/PD-L1\/CD40 tri-specific antibody that can promote CD40 agonist signaling in a PD-L1 dependent manner and simultaneously block PD-1\/PD-L1 interaction. We developed eight multi-specific antibody formats to analyze its structure-activity relationship, and selected an optimal format of CD40\/PD-L1 multi-specific antibody contains bivalent anti-CD40 binding one unique epitope and two distal anti-PD-L1 binding to distinct uncompetitive epitopes. These two uncompetitive PD-L1 binding epitopes can: i) reduce the dissociation rate of MBS307 from PD-L1 positive cells ; ii) enhance PD-L1\/PD-1 blockade efficacy; iii) offer a super cross-linking effect for CD40 agonist signaling. This format advantage allows MBS307 to be enriched in PD-L1 positive tumor tissue with conditionally activation of CD40+ cells in tumor microenvironment. We also conducted Fc engineering to abolish the interaction of Fc and FcRs, including FcRIIb, to avoid agonist associated liver toxicity. Our<i> in vitro<\/i> study indicated that, CD40 mAB has significant effect on macrophage, such as decreasing CD24 antibody induced ADCP efficacy and increasing TNF-&#945; secretion. However, MBS307 has almost none effect on macrophage. Meanwhile, MBS307 has agonist activity to DCs. We suspected that this different immunocyte activation pattern may relate with the different expression level of PD-L1 on macrophages and DCs. Co-incubation DCs with PD-L1 positive cancer cells can significantly enhance MBS307 agonist activity to DCs, indicating its predominant activity in PD-L1 positive tumor microenvironment. <i>In vivo<\/i> study results show that MBS307 demonstrate the most superior anti-tumor efficacy compared to single or combination mAbs against MC38-hPD-L1 tumors in PD-L1\/PD1\/CD40 triple humanized mice (B-hPD-L1\/hPD1\/hCD40). Furthermore, unlike single CD40 mAB treatment at 10 mg\/kg, MBS307 at high dose 15 mg\/kg did not elevate liver enzymes and decrease mouse body weight, indicating its improved safety profile. In summary, our data show MBS307 is a functional base designed tri-specific antibody with promising anti-tumor efficacy and safety profile by simultaneously blocking PD-1 and stimulating CD40 pathways.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,Immunostimulation,Bispecific antibody,Antibody engineering,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Feng Li<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jiangmei Li<sup><\/sup>, Xuechen Zhou<sup><\/sup>, Guangzhong Lin<sup><\/sup>, Wenqi Hu<sup><\/sup>, Huifang Liu<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Beijing Mabworks Biotech Co.

However, MM usually had heterogeneous cell populations with independent expressions of BCMA and GPRC5D, so TCEs only targeting BCMA or GPRC5D are suspected to have limitation on anti-tumor effect. Development a TCE simultaneously binding BCMA and GPRC5D may extend its therapeutic efficacy. MBS314 is a humanized tri-specific antibody against GPRC5D, BCMA, and CD3 for r\/r MM treatment. MBS314 has a weaker binding to CD3 (K<sub>D<\/sub>=181nM) than Talquetamab (K<sub>D<\/sub>=25.6 nM) and CC-93269 (K<sub>D<\/sub>=41.0 nM). Meanwhile,it has high affinities to GPRC5D (K<sub>D<\/sub>=3.5nM) and BCMA (K<sub>D<\/sub>=0.22nM), similar to Talquetamab (K<sub>D<\/sub>=4.21 nM, to GPRC5D) and CC-93269 (K<sub>D<\/sub>=1.0 nM, to BCMA). We developed a reporter assay to evaluate the function of TCEs: co-culture the tumor cells, such as H929, AMO1, or KMS-11, with Jurkat-NFAT-Luc reporter cells can induce luciferase expression, which can reflect the CD3 agonist signaling. MBS314 stimulated CD3 signaling when the reporter cells cultured along with any of the above MM cells, while Talquetamab failed to stimulate CD3 signaling when the reporter cells cultured along with KMS-11, which has low expression of GPRC5D, and CC-93269 was unable to stimulate CD3 signaling with AMO1 which has low expression of BCMA. The cytotoxicity assay also indicated MBS314 mediated T cell killing any of the above cells, while Talquetamab failed to kill KMS-11 and CC-93269 killed AMO-1 with low efficiency. In our <i>in vivo<\/i> xenograft MM murine models, MBS314 and Talquetamab induced regression of established MM.1S tumor in all of the mice (4\/4), while CC-93269 induced regression in half of the mice (2\/4) with dose at 0.5mg\/kg injected twice a week. And MBS314 inhibited the growth of the MOLP8 tumor, while Talquetamab and CC-93269 failed to prevent MOLP8 tumor growth. Especially, our<i> ex vivo<\/i> cytotoxicity assay with bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) from 15 MM patients indicated that MBS314 more efficiently induced T-cell-mediated depletion of CD138<sup>+<\/sup> MM cells than Talquetamab (mean(EC<sub>50<\/sub>)=0.06nM vs.1nM) and CC-93269 (mean(EC<sub>50<\/sub>)= 0.06nM vs.0.33nM). In addition, owning to the low affinity to CD3, MBS314 has no detectable toxicity in CD3 humanized mice. In summary, our data show MBS314 is a promising TCE for MM treatment with high efficacy and broad spectrum targeting both GPRC5D and BCMA, and also has excellent safety with low CD3 binding affinity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,T cell engager,G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR),BCMA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Feng Li<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Guojin Wu<sup>2<\/sup>, Hao Peng<sup>2<\/sup>, Jiangmei Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Yue Qi<sup>1<\/sup>, Guangzhong lin<sup>1<\/sup>, Huifang Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Wenqi Hu<sup>1<\/sup>, Jinying Ning<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Beijing Mabworks Biotech Co Ltd, Beijing, China,<sup>2<\/sup>KYinno Biotechnology Co.

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting tumor cell surface antigens can internalize and kill target cells upon liberation of their cytotoxic payload. Binding of the antibody component of an ADC by a HIO factor may potentially hamper the efficacy of a bound ADC. To assess any suppression of ADC&#8217;s activity by HIO factors, we evaluated the efficacy of a HIO-refractory ADC, NAV-001, and a HIO-bound ADC, SS1, both targeting mesothelin. The HIO factor MUC16\/CA125 protein, which binds to SS1 ADC, was shown to have a negative effect on its internalization and tumor cell killing. The MUC16\/CA125 refractory NAV-001 ADC was shown to have robust killing of tumor cells regardless of MUC16\/CA125 expression <i>in vitro<\/i> (EC<sub>50<\/sub> ~20 pM) as well as <i>in vivo<\/i> at single, sub-mg\/kg dosing.

When used as single agents, immunocytokines are often not able to cure mice and patients. However, it has been shown by our group that the combination of IL2- and TNF- based products was able to completely eradicate tumors in mouse models and to induce complete responses in cancer patients. We have previously described a novel class of immunocytokine products, termed &#8220;potency-matched dual cytokine antibody fusion proteins&#8221;, consisting of a tumor-targeting antibody (the F8 antibody, specific to the alternatively spliced EDA domain of fibronectin), simultaneously fused to both IL2 and TNF. To match biological activity of the two payloads a single-point mutation was inserted in the TNF sequence and the resulting product, named IL2-F8-TNF<sup>mut<\/sup> was able to selectively localize to tumors with excellent tumor-to-organ ratios and it was found to completely eradicate soft-tissue sarcomas in immunocompetent mice, which did not respond to standard chemotherapy. Moreover, the immunocytokine was able to induce complete responses in a variety of mouse models of cancer. The therapeutic activity was further improved when IL2-F8-TNF<sup>mut<\/sup> was used in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. At the mechanistic level we observed that the anticancer activity was completely abrogated when CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were depleted, while the contribution of NK cells was negligible. We now report the generation of a new potency-matched dual cytokine antibody fusion protein, named Tripokin based on the L19 antibody, specific to the alternatively spliced EDB domain of fibronectin. Compared to the previous product, Tripokin showed a favorable pharmacokinetic profile in monkey, an excellent localization to neoplastic lesions in mice and was easier to formulate for further clinical applications. When tested in tumor bearing mice, Tripokin revealed a superior anti-cancer activity compared to other IL2-based products.The results obtained in this work provided a rationale for future clinical translation activities using Tripokin as potential best-in-class tumor targeted IL2 product.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-2,Tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF-&#945;),Antibody engineering,Immunocytokines,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Eleonora Prodi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Riccardo Corbellari<sup>1<\/sup>, Mattia Matasci<sup>1<\/sup>, Dario Neri<sup>2<\/sup>, Roberto De Luca<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Philochem AG, Otelfingen, Switzerland,<sup>2<\/sup>Philogen SPA, Siena, Italy","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2daa6856-889b-45e6-aea6-9ee2352f0ea7","ControlNumber":"4309","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>E.

CD47, a cell surface molecule in the immunoglobulin superfamily, is another established target overexpressed on various malignant cells and acts as an innate inhibitory checkpoint by interrupting the phagocytosis of tumor cells and downstream activation of innate responses. It has been reported that the simultaneous blockade on both CD47 and PD-L1 checkpoints inhibited tumor growth and circulating tumor cells metastasis more potently than a single antibody inhibition or blank control in the 4T1 tumor mouse model in vivo. IMM2520 is an antibody-receptor (mAb-Trap) fusion protein consisting of recombinant human SIRP&#945; and anti- PD-L1 antibody, thereby targeting CD47 and PD-L1 to antagonize both innate and adaptive immune checkpoint pathways. IMM2520 binds to PD-L1 on the tumor cell membrane and restores the immune response of T cells. IMM2520 also reverses the inhibitory effect of tumor cells on macrophages by blocking the binding of CD47 on the tumor cell to SIRP&#945; on macrophages. <i>In vitro <\/i>studies have demonstrated that IMM2520 not only possesses a potent binding activity to CD47 (EC50 = 0.8 nM) and PD-L1 (EC50 = 0.09 nM) respectively, but also exhibits a strong activity in blocking PD-1\/PD-L1 binding (IC50 = 0.06 - 1.0 nM). IMM2520 also showed a potent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC, EC50 = 1.54 ng\/ml) against Raji-PDL1 and induced a strong antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP, EC50 = 0.04 nM) activity (THP-1 against Raji-PDL1). In vivo efficacy study with CT26-hPD-L1\/hCD47 colon cancer model demonstrated that IMM2520 at 3 mg\/kg significantly reduced tumor volume (TGITV<\/sub> = 90.12%, P&#60;0.01 vs Vehicle). Interestingly, IMM2520 demonstrated a potent and significantly higher anti-tumor activities than IMM01 (a SIRP&#945;-Fc fusion protein) and IMM2505 (also a CD47XPD-L1 mAb-Trap, but the variable region sequence of this PD-L1 antibody is identical to atezolizumab). IMM2520 at dose of 6 mg\/kg completely eradicated the established tumors. In another in vivo efficacy study with MC38-hCD47\/hPD-L1 colon cancer model, IMM2520 demonstrated a significant anti-tumor activity in a dose-dependent manner at doses between 2 mg\/kg to 20 mg\/kg. Given its potent preclinical anti-tumor activity as well as the favorable safety profile, IMM2520 may serve as a potent immunotherapy for multiple cancer types by targeting PD-L1 and CD47 on tumor cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer immunotherapy,PD-L1,CD47,monoclonal antibody,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Wenzhi Tian<sup><\/sup>, Song Li<sup><\/sup>, Dianze Chen<sup><\/sup>, Wenqi Zhu<sup><\/sup>, Yanan Yang<sup><\/sup>, Dandan Liu<sup><\/sup>, Huiqin Guo<sup><\/sup>, Chunmei Yang<sup><\/sup>, Li Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Wei Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Xiaoping Tu<sup><\/sup>, Liang Peng<sup><\/sup>, Gui Zhao<sup><\/sup>, Ruliang Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Fan Zhang<sup><\/sup>, <b>Frank Gan<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>ImmuneOnco Biopharmaceuticals (Shanghai) Inc., Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"76d6d0cf-6605-4003-9e67-ad8d949b482a","ControlNumber":"4094","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;W.

Nectin-4 is overexpressed in several tumor types, including breast, lung, urothelial, colorectal, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers. Overexpression of Nectin-4 is associated with multiple aspects of tumor progression such as proliferation, angiogenesis, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, metastasis, DNA repair and tumor relapse. This overexpression is correlated with poor prognosis, making Nectin-4 an attractive target for developing new therapeutic strategies for cancer. As a result, a substantial number of antibody drug conjugates targeting Nectin-4 are under development. Most of these therapies, however, display a high rate of drug related toxicities accentuating the need for alternative approaches for anti-cancer therapeutics targeting Nectin-4. We leveraged BioAtla&#8217;s Conditionally Active Biologic (CAB) platform to develop a dual CAB T cell engager (TCE) bispecific antibody targeting Nectin-4 and CD3 receptors (CAB-Nectin-4 x CAB-CD3 bispecific antibody). The dual CAB Nectin-4 x CD3 bispecific antibody was engineered to bind with high affinity to both Nectin-4 and CD3 receptor antigens under conditions that mimic the acidic tumor microenvironment, but with lower binding activity in physiological (alkaline) conditions.<i> In vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy data for a dual-CAB Nectin-4 x CD3 bispecific antibody will be presented.

Agonists against CD137 have shown promising therapeutic activity in mouse tumor models but have suffered setback in the clinic due to notably hepatotoxicity, or suboptimal agonistic potency. Here, we developed a fully human agonistic anti-CD137 monoclonal IgG4 antibody, ZG033, with an exclusive epitope, to achieve a better efficacy and safety profile for immunotherapy.<br \/>Methods: The antigen binding specificity and affinity of ZG033 were determined by ELISA, surface plasmon resonance (SPR). X-ray crystallography was conducted to resolve the binding epitopes of the respective binding arms. The activities were determined using cell-based and reporter gene assays. In vivo antitumor activities were evaluated in human 4-1BB transgenic mice bearing with syngeneic tumors, and possible toxicity was evaluated in humanized mice and cynomolgus monkeys. Cytokine release assay was conducted by incubating ZG033 with PBMCs from healthy donors. The pharmacokinetic (PK) behavior of ZG033 were characterized in cynomolgus monkeys. A phase 1 study was initiated to evaluate the safety and preliminary clinical activities of ZG033, as well as the immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics.<br \/>Results: ZG033 showed high specificity for human CD137 without cross-species reactivity across mouse, rat and exhibited potent CD137 agonist activity dependent on Fc&#947;R crosslinking. The binding affinity of ZG033 determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was moderate (KD=10 nM). X-ray crystallography revealed that the Fab of ZG033 binds CD137 at an epitope overlap with the ligand binding interface. ZG033 increased CD137-driven NF&#954;B reporter gene activation and the production of IFN-&#947; by human T cells in a Fc&#947;R-dependent manner. In human CD137 transgenic mice, ZG033 showed robust antitumor activity and induced durable antigen-specific immunological memory that prevented the tumor formation in the rechallenged mice. There were no signs of toxicity in human cytokine release assay which confirmed that ZG033 did not induce pro-inflammatory cytokines in the absence of TCR stimulation. Toxicology data in mice showed that ZG033 was well-tolerated with normal ALT and AST levels. ZG033 was further confirmed to well tolerated up to 180 mg\/kg (MTD&#8805;180mg\/kg) dose without systemic toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys. Patients with advanced tumors, who are refractory after exhausting available therapies, were enrolled for ZG033 treatment. We will report the results from early dose escalation part of the study.<br \/>Conclusion: These data demonstrate that ZG033 is an Fc&#947;R crosslinking-dependent CD137 agonist that displays a favorable safety profile and has potential in either mono- or combinational immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immuno-oncology,agonist,4-1BB,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yang Huang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Liangwei Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Wenting Liu<sup>3<\/sup>, Dayan Zhang<sup>3<\/sup>, Pengfei Zhou<sup>3<\/sup>, Qing Fang<sup>3<\/sup>, Weiming Zhou<sup>3<\/sup>, Fengrong Wang<sup>3<\/sup>, Guodong Shen<sup>4<\/sup>, Liansheng Cheng<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Ctr., Atlanta, GA,<sup>2<\/sup>Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA,<sup>3<\/sup>Hefei Hankemab Biotechnology Co., LTD, Hefei, China,<sup>4<\/sup>The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0a931f1f-2aeb-4a33-9b89-d174d6606ac3","ControlNumber":"2772","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

A promising strategy is the use of bispecific antibodies that recruit T cells to kill cancer cells by simultaneously binding to CD3 on T cells and tumor associated antigens. CD3-based T cell engagers are highly potent therapeutic molecules with T cell cytotoxicity activities. But high CRS risk and T cell exhaustion has been observed for high affinity CD3-based T cell engagers in clinicals. Effective and safe use of these therapeutics depends on selective targeting of cancer cells and optimal CD3 affinity. MUC17, a member of the mucin family, is a transmembrane glycoprotein only expressed on the apical membrane of normal gastrointestinal mucosal epithelial cells. MUC17 is overexpressed in 23%-52% of patients with gastric cancer. Compared to the adjacent normal tissues, the expression of MUC17 protein is consistently higher in gastric cancer tissues, suggesting that MUC17 is an attractive therapeutic target for gastric cancer.<br \/>Method &#38; Results: We created MUC17\/CD3 T cell engaging bispecific antibodies by starting with a nanobody humanized from camel and a low affinity CD3 antibody. Here we report the design and the promising preclinical activity of SCR-9171 molecule in vitro and in vivo. SCR-9171 induced T cell activation and had potent cytotoxicity of MUC17 positive tumor cells in vitro. However, the cytokine release was much lower than the positive control, which established with a high affinity CD3 antibody. Importantly, in mouse models with reconstituted human immune cells, SCR-9171 showed strong antitumor efficacy against MUC17-positive tumors through the activation of T cells. Tolerability and pharmacokinetics of MUC17\/CD3 bispecific antibody are being assessed in cynomolgus monkey. The results demonstrated that SCR-9171 was well tolerated in a one-month repeat-dose toxicology study at 3mg\/kg with no associated clinical signs or changes in body weight.<br \/>Conclusion: These findings suggest that MUC17\/CD3 bispecific antibody is a potential therapeutic molecule for MUC17-positive solid tumor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,T cell engager,MUC17,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Guangcun Cheng<sup><\/sup>, Yayuan Fu<sup><\/sup>, Hua Zheng<sup><\/sup>, Ling Li<sup><\/sup>, Xiaolei He<sup><\/sup>, Xi Jiao<sup><\/sup>, Shuhui Luan<sup><\/sup>, Shuai Wang<sup><\/sup>, Lei Jiang<sup><\/sup>, Wenjing Li<sup><\/sup>, Yun Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Lei Liu<sup><\/sup>, <b>Renhong Tang<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Jiangsu Simcere Pharmaceuticals Co.

The patients are rarely cured and experience the recurrence or resistance. There is still an urgent need to develop potential therapeutic agents with better response. BCMA (B cell maturation antigen) and GPRC5D (G-protein-coupled receptor class 5 member D) are independently expressed in MM cells. The percentage of MM patients with single or co-expression of BCMA and GPRC5D is close to 90%, which means both are the ideal therapeutical targets.<br \/>Methods\/Results: Anti-GPRC5D and anti-BCMA antibodies with high binding affinity were respectively screened from hybridoma or alpaca phage library. Two antibodies were assembled to anti-CD3 antibody with low binding activity. Candidate molecule SCR-8572 was selected from dozens of triple-specific antibodies. The affinity of SCR-8572 to recombinant BCMA protein is 41.3pM. Binding EC50 to GPRC5D over-expressed cell is 2.4nM. SCR-8572 also showed very good binding activity with several MM cell lines, such as H929, RPMI-8226 and Molp-8, etc. The weak binding to CD3 can decrease the sink effect in peripheral blood. <i>In vitro<\/i> cytotoxicity of SCR-8572 against three MM cell lines with different expression levels was evaluated. It showed strong tumor-induced T cell activation but not non-specific activation, which resulted in the excellent tumor cytotoxicity. And the cytotoxicity was much stronger than that of BCMA-CD3 (Teclistamab analogue) and\/or GPRC5D-CD3 (Talquetamab analogue) treatments. In the meanwhile, the cytokine release levels of IL-6 and TNFa are acceptable and similar with two TCE benchmarks. This predicted the low risk of CRS. We also conducted <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy test in two MM Cell-derived-Xenograft mice models with PBMC reconstitution. SCR-8572 can eliminate the tumors and maintained tumor regression after drug withdrawal, while the tumor relapse occurred in Teclistamab and\/or Talquetamb groups. The preliminary toxic effect of SCR-8572 was explored in cynomolgus by 10mpk followed by 30mpk intravenous injection with 21 days interval. The cynomolgus tolerated very well. Lymphocyte reduction was observed which indicated the lymphocyte redistribution. C Reaction Protein (CRP) level increased to 19-33mg\/L and recovered to baseline in 7 days. IL-6 level increased to 116.3pg\/ml in 24 hours after 10mpk injection and 52.5pg\/ml in 2 hours after followed 30mpk injection. IFN&#947;, IL-2 and IL-10 levels were detected to be very low or below the limit of quantitation.<br \/>Conclusion: We have developed a novel dual-targeted T cell engager for MM treatment, which showed strong tumor killing effect in <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> models with low CRS risk. The toleration of high dosage in cynomolgus suggested the good safety performance. Above all, the preclinical study illustrated SCR-8572 can be a promising therapeutic candidate in treatment of MM patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiple myeloma,T cell engager,BCMA,GPRC5D,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Yayuan Fu<sup><\/sup>, Shumei You<sup><\/sup>, Menghao Wei<sup><\/sup>, Bowei Yin<sup><\/sup>, Qi Deng<sup><\/sup>, Xiaokang Qin<sup><\/sup>, Yun Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Yanqiu Wang<sup><\/sup>, <b>Renhong Tang<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Jiangsu Simcere Pharmaceuticals Co.

Its high expression is associated with poor prognosis in several solid tumors. Many anti-Her3 antibodies have been developed for cancer therapy. To date, only patritumab deruxtecan (U3-1402) showed clinical efficacy in both NSCLC and breast cancer among all Her3-targeting therapies. DB-1310 is a HER3 ADC composed of a novel humanized anti-Her3 immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody, covalently linked to a proprietary DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor payload via a maleimide tetrapeptide-based cleavable linker with a drug antibody ratio (DAR) of approximately eight. In the present study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DB-1310 in preclinical models.<br \/>Methods: The binding of DB-1310 to Her3 and other HER families was measured by ELISA and SPR. The competition of binding epitope for DB-1310 and patritumab was tested by FACS. The sensitivity of breast cancer and lung cancer cell lines to DB-1310 was evaluated by in vitro cell killing assay. In vivo growth inhibition study evaluated the sensitivity of DB-1310 to Her3-positive breast cancer and lung cancer xenograft models. In addition, the efficacy of DB-1310 was compared to that of patritumab deruxtecan in tumor xenograft models. The pharmacokinetics and safety profile were also measured in cynomolgus monkey.<br \/>Results: In this study, DB-1310 showed high affinity to both Human and Cyno Her3 without cross reacting with Her2, Her4 or EGFR. DB-1310 binds Her3 using a different epitope from patritumab. DB-1310 has high internalization capability and translocates into lysosomes after internalization. In vitro, DB-1310 exhibited cytotoxicity in a panel of Her3- expression human breast cancer and lung cancer cell lines. It also showed dose-dependent antitumor killing activity in a HER3-positive breast cancer HCC1569 xenograft model and a lung cancer NCI-H441 xenograft model. Tumor regression was observed in a NSCLC patient-derived xenograft model with EGFR mutation under DB-1310 treatment. Moreover, DB-1310 showed stronger tumor growth inhibition than that of patritumab deruxtecan at the same dose. The systemic exposure AUC<sub>0-last<\/sub> and C<sub>max <\/sub>of DB-1310 and total antibody increased dose proportionally from 1 mg\/kg to 10 mg\/kg with low released payload in serum. The DB-1310 also showed good safety profile with highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) above 30mg\/kg.<br \/>Conclusions: DB-1310 exhibited its efficacy in tumor models both in vitro and in vivo. These studies suggest that DB-1310 as a novel HER3-targeting ADC showed antitumor efficacy for HER3 positive tumors with good safety profile.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),HER3,In vivo,In vitro,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Xi Li<sup><\/sup>, Jun Yao<sup><\/sup>, Chen Qu<sup><\/sup>, Luo Lan<sup><\/sup>, Bing Li<sup><\/sup>, Yu Zhang<sup><\/sup>, <b>Rong Shi<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Haiqing Hua<sup><\/sup>, Yang Qiu<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Research and Development, Duality Biologics, Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a6ee40d4-cd3c-4cd9-ac43-e8ae9d634242","ControlNumber":"3774","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>X.

However, the short <i>in vivo<\/i> half-life of sdAbs, related to the lack of a Fc domain, limits their clinical application. By replicating specifically into tumor cells, the oncolytic vaccinia virus (VACV) is an optimal vector to deliver and maintain high intra-tumoral concentrations of therapeutic sdAb. Moreover, sdAb targeting immunological targets, such as PD-L1, may synergize the anti-tumoral activity of VACV. Randox and Transgene report the selection and characterization of a sdAb targeting the human PD-L1 and the design of optimal formats, including bispecific anti-PD-L1-CD40 ligand, for vectorization into VACV.<br \/>Methods: Alpacas were immunized with human PD-L1 protein and sdAb coding sequences were isolated by PCR. Anti-PD-L1 sdAb binders were selected by phage display and sdAb blockers of PD-L1\/PD-1 interaction were identified by ELISA. The ability of the selected sdAb to disrupt the PD-L1\/PD-1 interaction was verified on transformed and primary cells. To fine-tune an optimal anti-PD-L1, several sdAb formats were designed and vectorized into VACV. The sdAb format exhibiting the best PD-L1\/PD-1 blocking activity was selected by the screening of culture supernatants of several VACV-sdAb infected tumor cells. Finally, anti-PD-L1 sdAb-CD40L fusions were designed to generate a strong CD40 agonist active only in a PD-L1 positive environment.<br \/>Results: SdAb clone 1A1 exhibited the best PD-L1\/PD-1 blocking activity which remained unchanged after extensive humanization (latterly becoming named GS542). GS542 was vectorized in VACV as monomeric single chain homodimer, and fused to Fc domain or antibody hinge domain to foster dimerization together with full length IgG1 avelumab as anti-PD-L1 benchmark. All constructs were expressed by infected tumor cells. The single chain homodimer displayed the best PD-L1\/PD-1 blocking activity, superior to that of avelumab. Moreover, GS542-CD40L fusions were designed to take advantage of the natural trimerization of CD40L to increase the avidity for PD-L1 while clustering CD40L at the surface of PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup> cells to trans-activate the CD40 pathway. Evaluation of these GS542-CD40L fusions showed strong CD40 agonist activity depending on the presence of PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup> cells making these constructs safer CD40 agonists.<br \/>Conclusion: An anti-PD-L1 sdAb with a strong blocking activity was selected, humanized and evaluated under different VACV-vectorized formats.

We used two proof-of-concept TCE targets to demonstrate that this panel streamlines CD3 T-cell engager (TCE) development, enabling identification of optimal tumor cell-killing and cytokine-release profiles. CD3 TCEs have potential to be powerful cancer treatments, but the small number of available CD3-binding antibodies and limited multispecific engineering technologies have been barriers to development. Identifying TCEs that balance anti-tumor potency with potential toxicities, such as cytokine release syndrome, requires simultaneous tuning of both the CD3- and tumor-binding arms. Pairs of antibodies that achieve this balance are rare, creating a need for diverse panels of developable antibodies that can be combined and tested to identify optimal clinical candidates. To streamline TCE development, we discovered a diverse panel of CD3-binding antibodies. We screened over 5 million single cells from humanized mice and identified 585 unique CD3-specific antibody sequences. Of these, over 170 were identified as cross-reactive to human and cyno CD3 in primary screening. We then used high-throughput characterization to curate a panel of diverse and developable antibodies. We found a wide range of CD3&#949;&#948; and CD3&#949;&#947; binding specificities, affinities, and kinetics. Epitope binning analysis revealed multiple bins containing human and cyno cross-reactive binders, some of which are distinct from previously described cross-reactive antibodies, such as SP34-2. We assessed their biophysical properties and identified antibodies with good developability properties, including high thermal stability and low hydrophobicity, self-association, polyspecificity, and aggregation. To validate these antibodies, we used OrthoMab&#8482; to generate proof-of-concept TCE panels with fixed tumor-binding arms. We identified CD3 x EGFR TCEs with high potency, low cytokine release, functional cross-reactivity in a cyno T cell-mediated tumor killing assay, and good pharmacokinetic properties in Tg32 mice. A second proof-of-concept CD3 x PSMA panel further validated our antibodies in bispecific formats. Together, these studies demonstrate that starting with diverse CD3-binding antibodies streamlines identification of developable TCEs with optimal potency and cytokine release. We leveraged data from our extensive characterization of CD3-binding antibodies in mono- and bispecific formats to develop a strategy for down-selection and pairing of CD3- and tumor-binding antibodies, and a high-throughput method for analysis of resulting TCEs. By categorizing antibodies based on functional properties, we are able to rapidly pinpoint optimal potential clinical candidates for specific tumor targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,Bispecific antibody,Precision medicine,Antibody engineering,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Juntao (Matt) Mai<sup><\/sup>, Kate Caldwell<sup><\/sup>, Lindsay DeVorkin<sup><\/sup>, Grace  P.

However, these ADC drugs still face challenges of acquired resistance and\/or severe adverse effects associate with their payload toxins. Eribulin, a market approval agent for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and liposarcoma , is a new choice of ADC payload with distinct mechanism of action (MOA). Here we report preclinical studies of BB-1701, a novel HER2-tageting eribulin-containing ADC. BB-1701 exhibited potent and specific cytotoxicity activities to various types of cancer cells where HER2-exprssing levels vary in large ranges. BB-1701 induced tumor-growth suppression, even regression in <i>in vivo<\/i> models with a single dose of 1-5 mg\/kg dosage. In comparison with other HER2-targeting ADCs with different toxin payloads (DM1, MMAE and Dxd), eribulin-containing ADC demonstrated higher potency to cancer cell lines with low HER2 expressing levels (with lower IC<sub>50<\/sub>). BB-1701 also showed effective tumor suppression in models insensitive to T-DM1 or T-Dxd. Mode of action studies revealed significant bystander cytotoxicity of BB-1701 to HER2-low cells when co-cultured with HER2-high cells. Additionally, BB-1701 treatment increased ATP releasing and Calreticulin expression, both were deemed immunogenic cell death (ICD) markers. Lastly, repeat dose pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies in nonhuman primates revealed favorable PK and safety profiles of BB-1701 in the clinical intend dosage route and schedule. In conclusion, these comprehensive preclinical data have strongly supported BB-1701 as a potent antitumor agent to cancers including HER2-low expressing and\/or cancers insensitive to other HER2-targeting ADCs. A phase I clinical study of BB-1701 in those patients is ongoing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),HER2\/neu,Preclinical,Tumor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yang Wang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Bing Xia<sup>1<\/sup>, Lixia Cao<sup>1<\/sup>, Jianfeng Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Cui Feng<sup>1<\/sup>, Fangdun Jiang<sup>1<\/sup>, Chen Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Lixia Gu<sup>1<\/sup>, Yifan Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Jing Tian<sup>1<\/sup>, Cindy Cheng<sup>2<\/sup>, Keiji Furuuchi<sup>2<\/sup>, James Fulmer<sup>2<\/sup>, Arielle Verdi<sup>2<\/sup>, Katherine Rybinski<sup>2<\/sup>, Allis Soto<sup>2<\/sup>, Earl Albone<sup>2<\/sup>, Toshimitsu Uenaka<sup>2<\/sup>, Likun Gong<sup>3<\/sup>, Tingting Liu<sup>3<\/sup>, Qiuping Qin<sup>3<\/sup>, Ziping Wei<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuhong Zhou<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Bliss Biopharmaceutical (Hangzhou) Co., Ltd, Hangzhou, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Epochal Precision Anti-Cancer Therapeutics (EPAT), Cell Lineage and Differentiation (CLD) Domain, Eisai Inc., Exton, PA,<sup>3<\/sup>Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"686adfb0-5bde-400f-b746-8f07ba247930","ControlNumber":"5579","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;Y.

There are two types of exhausted T cells present in the tumor microenvironment: progenitor exhausted T cells and terminally exhausted T cells. Data from various mouse syngeneic tumor models suggest that the dominance of progenitor exhausted T cells will be replaced by terminally exhausted T cells as the tumor progresses. The PD1\/PDL1 antibodies mainly act on progenitor exhausted T cells and can develop acquired resistance as terminally exhausted T cells become the dominant cells in the tumor microenvironment. Recently, there are studies demonstrating that IL10 can restore the oxidative phosphorylation metabolism of terminally exhausted T cells and restore their potent killing activities of tumor cells. We therefore designed IAE0972, a novel EGFR\/IL10 immunocytokine to solve the problems of immune cell exhaustion in current immunotherapy. It is a monovalent anti-EGFR antibody fused with IL10 homodimer. The anti-EGFR antibody can specifically enrich IAE0972 in tumor microenvironment, so that IL10 can reinvigorate antigen specific CD8+ T cells and facilitate its proliferation, while preserving the tumor cell proliferation inhibition activities of EGFR antibody. The design of monovalent form anti-EGFR antibody can also avoid the skin toxicity problem. In this study, we studied the target binding activity, CD8+ T cell activation activity and cancer cell proliferation inhibition activity of IAE0972. We also observed a much higher anti-tumor efficacy of IAE0972 in a MC38 syngeneic tumor model compared with that of Cetuximab. In addition, the molecule has a very good safety profile with MTD over 6 mg\/kg and no skin toxicities, which is about 300-fold higher than that of cytokine drugs. In summary, IAE0972 is an innovative EGFR\/IL10 immunocytokine with robust preclinical anti-tumor efficacy and favorable safety profile, which has the potential to address acquired resistance of current immunotherapy. IAE0972 is the first EGFR\/IL10 immunocytokine with IND approval from both FDA and NMPA. The indications of IAE0972 include colorectal cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, squamous non-small cell lung cancer, and other EGFR positive tumors. A Phase I\/IIa clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of IAE0972 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic malignant tumors is on-going (NCT05396339).","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunocytokines,Interleukin-10,EGFR,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Liusong Yin<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Xiaoling Jiang<sup><\/sup>, Chongbing Wu<sup><\/sup>, Zi Chen<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>SUNHO (China) BioPharmaceutical Co.,Ltd., Nanjing, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7bdab16c-ea1f-4650-be7b-9659cf9e03ad","ControlNumber":"2759","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

The exclusion, desertification and exhaustion of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) have been found and confirmed in many tumor cases, accounting for the major problems of current PD1\/L1-oriented immunotherapy. Cytokines, on the other hand, have been demonstrated efficacious in activating immune cells in TME and achieved great progress in certain diseases, but it is generally accompanied by severe systematic toxicities. The field of antibody-cytokine fusion proteins (immunocytokines) arose to target these effector molecules to the TME to expand the therapeutic window of cytokine therapy. Therefore, we have developed IAP0971 as a novel immunocytokine that binds specifically to PD1 and fuses IL15\/IL15R&#945; complex for cancer immunotherapy. In IAP0971, IL15\/IL15R&#945; complex specifically binds to the IL2\/15R&#946;&#947; and promotes the proliferation and activation of T cells and NK cells, without activation of Treg cells or inducing apoptosis of activated T cells which are common side effects of IL2-based therapies. Anti-PD1 antibody in IAP0971 can specifically target IL15 into the TME due to the high expression of PD1 in the TME. Both of the components act in the same location and on the same cells at the same time showing great cis-synergy, which will further improve the effectiveness and therapeutic window of IAP0971. We report here the preclinical characterization of IAP0971 including pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and toxicology, and discuss its potential as a novel agent for treating patients with advanced malignant tumors. IAP0971 bound to human IL2\/15R&#946; specifically and blocked PD1\/PDL1 signaling. IAP0971 promoted the proliferation of CD8+T cells and NKT cells, and further activated NK cells to kill tumor cells validated by in vitro assays. In a hPD1 knock-in mouse model, IAP0971 showed potent anti-tumor activity. Preclinical studies in non-human primates following single or repeated dosing of IAP0971 showed favorable pharmacokinetics and well-tolerated toxicology profile. In summary, IAP0971 has demonstrated a favorable safety profile and potent anti-tumor activities in vivo, which has the potential to address both primary non-responsiveness and acquired resistance of current immunotherapy. IAP0971 is the first armed PD1\/IL15 immunocytokine with IND approval from both FDA and NMPA. The indications of IAP0971 include lung cancer, cervical cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, liver cancer, lymphoma, and other malignant tumors.

It belongs to the family of receptor tyrosine kinases and its specific ligands are NT-4\/5 and BDNF. The (over)expression of TrkB and (over)activation of the BDNF\/TrkB signaling pathway is implicated in various solid malignancies and associated with poor prognosis due to the role of TrkB in suppressing anoikis and promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Here we present the development and characterization of novel T cell engagers targeting TrkB. A panel of 41 sequence unique antibodies were selected from human phage display libraries and B cells of TrkB-ECD immunized chicken. Following recombinant expression, the panel of antibodies was analyzed for off-rate, binding reactivity to plate-immobilized and cell-expressed TrkB, cross-reactivity to other tropomyosin kinase family members, and competition with BDNF. Based on their characteristics, two targeting arms were prioritized for the generation of T cell engagers using a standard bispecific knob-into-hole approach. Apart from a commercial CD3 targeting arm, three proprietary CD3 targeting arms were also analyzed. After successful production of the bispecifics , the molecules were validated to bind to plate-immobilized TrkB and CD3 separately and cell-associated TrkB and CD3 simultaneously. In addition, our TrkB T cell engagers were able to induce varying levels of T cell activation<i> in vitro<\/i>. Our data suggests that these TrkB\/CD3 bispecific molecules could be interesting candidates for further development into immuno-oncology therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,Bispecific antibody,Tyrosine kinase receptors,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jetta Bijlsma<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Srinidhi Desikan<sup><\/sup>, Timothy Miller<sup><\/sup>, Allie Thom<sup><\/sup>, Jennifer Bath<sup><\/sup>, Ilse Roodink<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Talem Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"fd64d46d-8b09-47ce-9541-9b4751735561","ControlNumber":"6035","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

These antibodies will form the basis for the tumor-binding arm of T-cell engagers (TCEs) against this target.<br \/>Bispecific CD3 TCEs have the potential to transform cancer treatment by redirecting T cells to tumor targets, but technological barriers have limited their development for solid tumors. Targets for TCEs have generally been limited to surface-expressed proteins, however, access to intracellular proteins that are mutated and\/or differentially expressed in cancer cells would expand the target pool. Peptides of these intracellular proteins presented on MHC class I (MHC-I) provide opportunities for TCE development. Technologies powering discovery of rare antibodies that are ultra-specific, high-affinity pMHC binders are needed to expand this promising class of tumor targets.<br \/>We have developed a technology platform for the discovery of optimal TCEs, including a diverse panel of CD3-binding antibodies and an antibody discovery and development engine that includes multispecific engineering capabilities, powered by OrthoMab<sup>TM<\/sup>. We are applying this platform to develop TCEs against MAGE-A4, an intracellular tumor target expressed by many solid tumors, but not by healthy tissues.<br \/>Using proprietary immunization technologies, we triggered robust, diverse antibody responses against a complex of a human MAGE-A4 peptide presented on MHC-I. We used high-throughput microfluidic technology to screen single B cells using a multiplexed bead-binding assay to identify antibodies specific to the target, but not closely-related pMHCs. We then expressed and purified antibodies for downstream validation and characterization. Antibody specificity was initially validated using a panel of related pMHC complexes, and developability properties were assessed, including hydrophobicity, self-association, polyspecificity, stability, and aggregation.<br \/>With complex data integration and analysis, we identified a panel of diverse and developable antibodies that bind with high affinity to a human MAGE-A4 peptide sequence of 10 amino acids presented on MHC-I (HLA:02*01). Strategic selection and pairing of these target-binding antibodies with our large and diverse panel of fully human CD3-binders will power the discovery of ultra-specific MAGE-A4 TCEs with optimal potency and cytokine release.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody,Peptides,Antigen presentation,T cell engager,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Davide Tortora<sup><\/sup>, Peter Bergqvist<sup><\/sup>, Grace  P.
