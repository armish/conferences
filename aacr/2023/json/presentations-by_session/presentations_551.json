However, protein targets for these loci remain largely unknown. Identifying protein targets and biomarkers can improve the understanding of cancer biology and etiology and identify high-risk individuals for cancer prevention. In this study, we investigated genetically predicted levels of 1,142 circulating proteins with breast cancer risk in 133,384 cases and 113,789 controls of European ancestry included in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). We identified 22 blood protein biomarkers associated with the risk of overall breast cancer at a false discovery rate (FDR) &#60;0.05, including nine proteins encoded by genes located at least 500kb away from previously reported risk variants for breast cancer. Analyses focusing on 124 encoding genes located at GWAS-identified breast cancer risk loci found 20 proteins associated with overall breast cancer risk and one protein associated with triple-negative breast cancer risk at FDR &#60;0.05. Adjustment for the GWAS-identified risk variants significantly attenuated the association for 13 of these proteins, suggesting that these proteins may be the targets of these GWAS-identified risk loci. The identified proteins are involved in various biological processes, including glutathione conjugation, STAT5 signaling, and NF-kB signaling pathways. Our study identified novel protein targets and risk biomarkers for breast cancer risk.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-02 Biomarkers of endogenous or exogenous exposures, early detection, and biologic effects,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Biomarkers,Plasma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Guochong Jia<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yaohua Yang<sup>2<\/sup>, Jie Ping<sup>1<\/sup>, Shuai Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Lili Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Xingyi Guo<sup>1<\/sup>, Ran Tao<sup>3<\/sup>, Jirong Long<sup>1<\/sup>, Wei Zheng<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN,<sup>2<\/sup>Center for Public Health Genomics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a931ff6c-98ab-4e1d-8fa9-26a29eae7773","ControlNumber":"2459","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>G.

Based on gene expression profiling of the tumor, DLBCL is classified into two major molecular subtypes linked to cell-of-origin (COO): germinal center (GCB) and activated B-Cell (ABC). The GCB subtype is characterized by a high prevalence of somatic mutations, particularly in apoptosis genes (e.g., <i>BCL2<\/i>) which is characteristic of follicular lymphoma (FL, another GCB lymphoma). The development of the validated NanoString gene expression test as well as immunohistochemistry markers that work in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue allows for the classification of DLBCL by COO in epidemiological studies. We hypothesized that integration of COO with germline genetics could provide insight into the underlying biology driving this heterogeneity, as well as insight into putative function of germline risk variants. Prior genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 7 SNPs in 6 susceptibility loci for DLBCL, including: 2p23.3 (rs79480871 <i>NCOA1<\/i>), 3q13.33 (rs9831894 <i>CD86<\/i>), 3p24.1 (rs6773363 <i>EOMES<\/i>), 6p21.33 (rs2523607 <i>HLA-B<\/i>), 6p25.3 (rs116446171 <i>EXOC2<\/i>), and 8q24.21 (rs13255292 and rs4733601 <i>PVT1<\/i> and <i>MYC<\/i>). Two of these loci were also identified in FL GWAS (different lead SNPs): 6p21.33 (rs3130437) and 8q24.21 (rs13254990 <i>PVT1<\/i>). Additional published FL susceptibility loci include: 3q28 (rs6444305 <i>LPP<\/i>), 6p21.32 (rs9268839), 11q23.3 (rs4938573 <i>CXCR5<\/i>), 11q24.3 (rs4937362 <i>ETS1<\/i>), and 18q21.33 (rs17749561 <i>BCL2<\/i>). Here we evaluated whether the published DLBCL\/FL loci differ by COO molecular subtypes. We evaluated each of the 14 DLBCL\/FL SNPs by case-case (GCB vs. nonGCB DLBCL) and polytomous case-control (GCB, nonGCB, and FL vs. controls) analyses. DLBCL cases were classified into GCB vs. nonGCB based on best available data from NanoString, RNAseq, followed by the Hans algorithm. A total of 778 DLBCL cases (470 GCB and 308 nonGCB), 1,050 FL cases, and 1,383 controls were analyzed. Odds ratios (OR) based on ordinal encoding of each SNP and 95% CI were calculated for each of the comparison groups. The ORs for four GWAS SNPs were significantly elevated in GCB vs. nonGCB DLBCL as well as in FL; two were FL GWAS SNPs from the HLA region (6p21.32 and 6p21.33) and the other two (<i>BCL2<\/i> and <i>ETS1<\/i>) are important in the germinal center program. In contrast, one SNP (<i>EXOC2<\/i>) was significantly elevated in nonGCB-DLBCL and was not associated with GCB-DLBCL or FL; this SNP is also near <i>IRF4<\/i> (<i>MUM1<\/i>), a gene important in the ABC program. For the remaining SNPs, there were suggestive associations for GCB-DLBCL and FL versus nonGCB DLBCL (<i>CD86<\/i>, <i>CXCR5<\/i>); nonGCB-DLBCL vs. GCB-DLBCL and FL (<i>NCOA1<\/i>, <i>PVT1<\/i>); and associations that showed no pattern with COO (<i>EOMES<\/i>, <i>LPP<\/i>, <i>HLA-B<\/i> and <i>MYC<\/i>). These findings provide insight into the shared pathogenesis of FL and GCB-DLBCL to inform etiologic mechanisms and risk assessment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-11 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\/post-GWAS,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Genome-wide association studies (GWAS),,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Rosalie Griffin Waller<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Dennis P.

Our previous exome sequencing analysis highlighted 36 aggressive PCa candidate genes in populations of European ancestry. Here we investigated whether rare germline pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or deleterious (P\/LD\/D) variants in these genes were associated with overall and aggressive PCa risk in men of African ancestry.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: This exome sequencing analysis consists of 7,176 prostate cancer cases and 4,873 controls from the Research on Prostate Cancer in Men of African Ancestry (RESPOND) study. Among the PCa cases, 3,283 are aggressive cases (tumor stage T3\/T4, regional lymph node involvement, metastatic disease, Gleason score &#62;= 8.0, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level &#62;= 20 ng\/mL or PCa as the underlying cause of death) including 1,074 metastatic cases, and 1,752 are non-aggressive cases (Gleason score &#60;= 7.0, PSA &#60; 20 ng\/mL, and tumor stage T1\/T2). P\/LP\/D variants analyzed were rare (minor allele frequency &#60; 1% in controls) and had either a Variant Effect Predictor impact score of &#8220;high&#8221; or a pathogenic or likely pathogenic ClinVar classification. The association between P\/LP\/D carrier status with risk of overall PCa, aggressive PCa, and metastatic PCa was evaluated in logistic regression models, adjusting for age and the top ten principal components. All statistical tests are two-sided.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: Of the 36 PCa candidate genes, <i>BRCA2<\/i> was the most frequently affected gene, with 1.7% of cases and 1.1% of controls harboring a germline P\/LP\/D variant, followed by <i>MUTYH<\/i> (1.5%\/1.3%) <i>ATM <\/i>(0.93%\/0.49%), <i>MSH5<\/i> (0.70%\/0.51%) and <i>HOXB13<\/i> (0.70%\/0.35%). Nominally significant associations with overall PCa were observed for <i>ATM<\/i> (OR=1.83, 95% CI=1.14-2.92, P=0.012), <i>BRCA2 <\/i>(OR=1.52, 95% CI=1.10-2.10, P=0.011), <i>HOXB13<\/i> (OR=2.10, 95% CI=1.12-3.66, P=0.008), and <i>PALB2 <\/i>(OR=3.46, 95% CI=1.18-10.1, P=0.02). In case-case analyses (aggressive vs. non-aggressive cases), the association with aggressive PCa was nominally significant for <i>ATM<\/i> (OR=5.10, 95% CI=1.96-13.3, P=8.7&#215;10<sup>-4<\/sup>) and <i>BRCA2<\/i> (OR=2.00, 95% CI=1.19-3.38, P=0.009) and was suggestive for <i>PALB2<\/i> (OR=2.99, 95% CI=0.83-10.7, P=0.09). Similar associations with metastatic PCa were also observed for these three genes.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>The associations of <i>BRCA2<\/i>, <i>ATM,<\/i> and <i>PALB2<\/i> with overall PCa and aggressive PCa observed in men of African ancestry are consistent with findings from our previous study in men of European ancestry. These findings further support the importance of these genes in the consideration of screening and active surveillance for high-risk and advanced disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-15 Next-generation sequencing in epidemiology studies (whole genome, exome, targeted, or fine-mapping),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Exome sequencing,Aggressive Prostate Cancer,Candidate Genes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Fei Chen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Burcu F.

Prior studies in high-risk BC cohorts identified variable BC risks based on the position and type of mutation in <i>BRCA1<\/i> and <i>BRCA2<\/i>, and based on the type of mutation in <i>ATM, CHEK2<\/i>, and <i>PALB2<\/i>. Whether this variability holds true in the general population has not been evaluated. To determine the BC risks associated with mutations of different types and in different locations in BC susceptibility genes in the general population, we carried out case-control analyses of 32247 cases and 32544 controls in the CARRIERS study, including 12 US population-based studies, and case-control analyses, subset to mutation carriers. We used age-adjusted logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (OR), relative OR (rOR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for PVs in <i>BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, CHEK2<\/i>, and <i>PALB2<\/i>. ORs were estimated using the full population of mutation carriers and noncarriers while rORs were estimated within subsets of individual gene mutation carriers. We identified 273 <i>BRCA1<\/i>, 421 <i>BRCA2<\/i>, 253 <i>ATM<\/i>, 351 <i>CHEK2<\/i>, and 148 <i>PALB2<\/i> in women with BC and 35 <i>BRCA1<\/i>, 84 <i>BRCA2<\/i>, 139 <i>ATM<\/i>, 139 <i>CHEK2<\/i>, and 38 <i>PALB2<\/i> variant carriers in those without BC. For <i>BRCA1<\/i>, we did not find differences in risk by mutation type or location. However, variants leading to nonsense mediated decay (NMD) predicted to have re-initiation at p.M128 had a non-statistical 3-fold higher risk for BC compared to those leading to NMD without re-initiation (rOR 3.1, 0.99-13.52, p = 0.0826). <i>BRCA2<\/i> loss of function (LoF) mutations in exons 1-10 had a higher BC risk compared to LoF mutations in the exon 11 (rOR 2.7, 1.1-7.9, p=0.048) ovarian cancer cluster region (OCCR). We did not detect any differences in risk by mutation type or location in <i>ATM<\/i>, <i>CHEK2<\/i>, or <i>PALB2.<\/i> <i>CHEK2<\/i> missense variants p.I157T (rOR 0.5, 0.4-0.7, p &#60;0.001) and p.T476M (rOR 0.5, 0.3 - 0.8, p=0.005) were associated with lower BC risk relative to <i>CHEK2<\/i> c.1100delC (OR 2.5, 2.0-3.3, p&#60;0.001). The <i>CHEK2<\/i> c.444+1G&#62;A splicing variant was associated with highest BC risk among common CHEK2 variants (OR 4.2, 1.9-10.5, p&#60;0.001), but was not statistically significantly different from c.1100delC (rOR 1.7, 0.8-4.3, p=0.230). In summary, we identified a higher BC risk for LoF variants in <i>BRCA2<\/i>, lower risk for <i>CHEK2<\/i> missense mutations, and non-statistical higher risk for NMD\/re-initiation <i>BRCA1<\/i> variants and <i>CHEK2<\/i> c.444+1G&#62;A in this population-based study. Despite the large numbers included in the overall CARRIERS study, the number of PV carriers was relatively small, which may have limited the detection of associations. Nonetheless, we were able to detect genotype-risk associations that have implications for counseling women about their BC risk, and certainly for the development of individualized risks.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-15 Next-generation sequencing in epidemiology studies (whole genome, exome, targeted, or fine-mapping),,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genetic susceptibility,Breast cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mwangala  P.

Individuals were classified into different genetic risk subgroups based on the relationship between their own PRS mean\/PRS CI and the population level threshold. Multivariable analyses controlling for age, gender and smoking history were conducted to discover the relative risk of lung cancer for different PRS risk subgroups. Lung cancer risk prediction models incorporating both PRS risk subgroups and non-genetic risk factors were constructed and evaluated using five-fold cross-validation.<br \/>Results: Considerable variance in PRS point estimates at the individual level was observed for both methods, with an average standard deviation (s.d.) of 0.12 (95% CI = 0.09-0.15) for PRS-CV and a much larger s.d. of 0.88 (95% CI = 0.68-1.11) for PRS-Bayes. With a credible level <i>p <\/i>= 95%, PRS-CV only classified 24.3% of the low genetic risk and 15.6% of the high genetic risk population with certainty, while PRS-Bayes was unable to find any eligible individuals. Only 19% of the individuals were commonly identified as high genetic risk using the two PRS estimators. An increased relative risk of lung cancer was observed for PRS risk subgroups identified by PRS CI approach (OR = 2.92, 95% CI = 2.26-3.78, p-value = 2.5<i>*<\/i>10<sup>-16<\/sup>) compared to by PRS mean (OR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.99-2.45, p-value = 1.6<i>*<\/i>10<sup>-50<\/sup>). Similar improvement was observed in stratified analyses by gender, lung cancer histologies and smoking history, with the largest increase observed in never smokers. Improved risk prediction performance was consistently observed in individuals identified by PRS CI approach and it achieved the best performance when incorporating age, gender and smoking packyears (AUC: 0.73, 95% CI = 0.72-0.74).<br \/>Conclusion: Our study first characterized the uncertainty of lung cancer PRS for individuals and evaluated the potential impacts on subsequent risk stratification and prediction in populations with European ancestry. Lung cancer PRS estimated using different methods have modest correlations at the individual level, highlighting the importance of taking serious considerations integrating PRS in clinical interpretation and implementation in precision medicine.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-21 Risk prediction models for incidence, prognosis, and\/or mortality,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Polygenic risk score ,Genetic factors,Precision medicine ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xinan Wang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ziwei Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Yi Ding<sup>3<\/sup>, Tony Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Lorelei Mucci<sup>1<\/sup>, Christopher I.

We aim to identify specific chromosomal regions that, when impacted by mCAs, are most predictive of CLL risk and evaluate their predictive utility in models that include established CLL risk factors. We utilized genotype array data from 436,784 participants in the UK Biobank (UKBB) and 35,382 participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) screening trial to identify mCAs. UKBB was split (90\/10) into training and test sets, and PLCO served as an external validation set. We developed sequential regression models to predict risk of CLL, with a baseline model consisting of age, age-squared, sex, smoking status, and ancestry. Additional models evaluated mCAs, a CLL polygenic risk score (PRS), and blood cell counts. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the predictive utility for both 5-year and 10-year CLL risk. Any detectable mCA was associated with incident CLL (Hazards Ratio (HR)=26, 95% Confidence interval (CI)=21-31), and mCAs on each individual chromosome were associated with increased CLL risk. mCAs on segments of chromosomes 13, 12, 22, 14, and 11 had the largest effect size (e.g., chr 13q14 HR=199, 95%CI=155-257). The CLL prediction model, including baseline factors, CLL PRS, and any autosomal mCA status, showed strong predictive utility in independent UKBB (AUC=0.88) and PLCO (AUC=0.88) samples. Restricting to a subset of mCAs strongly associated with CLL did not improve performance over including any detectable autosomal mCA. After the inclusion of blood cell traits, predictive utility further increased in UKBB (AUC=0.91; no count data available in PLCO). We observed the strongest CLL predictive utility in 5-year risk compared to 10-year risk across all models. mCAs genome-wide are associated with CLL risk, with variable effects across chromosomes and specific chromosomal regions. Autosomal mCAs are strong independent predictors of CLL risk and substantially add to predictive utility over standard clinical measures. The predictive utility of autosomal mCAs is strongest within the first 1-5 years of sample collection. Evaluation of mCAs could provide added utility for risk stratification in populations at high risk of CLL.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++PS01-21 Risk prediction models for incidence, prognosis, and\/or mortality,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,Predictive biomarkers,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Aubrey  K.

Yet, the impact of changing contraceptive types and patterns of use on ovarian cancer incidence is unclear and the biologic pathway through which contraception influences ovarian cancer risk is not well understood. Using multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) technology, we evaluated how contraception influences the tumor immune microenvironment (e.g., T cells) to better understand the association of intrauterine device (IUD) and oral contraception (OC) use on ovarian cancer risk.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We measured tumor immune profiles via mIF on tissue microarrays including tumor cores from 214 women with ovarian cancer (85% high grade serous) and 414 population-based controls frequency matched on age who participated in the New England Case Control Study. T cell types were defined by expression of CD3+ (total T cells), CD3+CD4+ (helper), CD3+CD8+ (cytotoxic), CD3+CD4+FoxP3+ (regulatory), CD3+CD4+CD69+ or CD3+CD8+CD69+ (recently activated), or CD3+Tim3+ or CD3+Lag3+(exhausted). The average immune cell density across 3 cores per tumor was used to categorize tumors as high or low abundance based on the median across all tumors. Contraception use was self-reported and included having ever used an IUD and\/or OCs and duration of use. Polytomous logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for ovarian cancer defined by tumor immune cell abundance adjusted for age at diagnosis or interview, parity, and family history of breast or ovarian cancer in first degree relative.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Overall, ever use of IUD or OC was not differentially associated with ovarian cancer risk by T cell tumor immune profiles. However, for OC use of 5 years or longer, we observed a significant reduction in risk for low-abundance total T cell (OR<sub>low<\/sub>=0.44, 95% CI 0.21-0.94), cytotoxic T cell (OR<sub>low<\/sub>=0.44, 95% CI:0.21-0.94), regulatory T cell (OR<sub>low<\/sub>=0.31, 95% CI: 0.14-0.68), and recently activated T cell (CD3+CD4+CD69+ OR<sub>low<\/sub>=0.34, 95% CI: 0.17-0.68) tumors with significant trends with longer duration. There was no significant decrease in risk of tumors with high abundance of these T cell types, although statistically significant heterogeneity was only observed in the association for duration of OC use and risk by low and high abundance of recently activated helper T cells (CD3+CD4+CD69+, <i>p<\/i>-het=0.006).<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>These results suggest that ever use of IUD and OCs are not associated with risk of ovarian tumors by immune phenotype, though risk by T cell abundance may vary with longer duration.
