PDAC is distinguished by the early formation of a highly immunosuppressive fibro-cellular tumor microenvironment (TME). Our group has demonstrated that IL-17 is necessary for the development and spread of pancreatic cancer, but we have not yet identified the cellular compartment responsible for IL-17-mediated tumor promotion. We propose that early pancreatic carcinogenesis is mediated by modification of an immunosuppressive program and is dependent on pancreatic epithelial IL-17\/IL-17RA signaling. We created mice with Kras activated and IL-17RA selectively deleted from the pancreatic compartment (KC; IL-17RA<sup>fl\/fl<\/sup>). In order to specifically remove IL-17RA from hematopoietic cells, we implanted IL-17RA deficient (IL17-RA<sup>-\/-<\/sup>) bone marrow cells into KC animals. While deletion of IL-17RA in the hematological compartment had no effect on the progression of pancreatic carcinogenesis, deletion of IL-17RA from the epithelial compartment delayed the development of premalignant lesions, indicating that the pancreatic epithelium is the compartment required for IL-17\/IL-17RA signaling during tumorigenesis. Deletion of IL-17RA from the oncogenic epithelium resulted in increased cytotoxic CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells infiltration in the TME. To learn more about the transcriptional alterations brought on by the lack of IL-17RA in the pancreatic compartment we performed single cell sequencing of pancreas tissue of KC and KC; IL-17RA<sup>fl\/fl <\/sup>. We found that the absence of IL-17RA in the pancreatic compartment had an impact on epithelial cells transcriptional profiles, with modulation of several immune pathways including regulation of B7-H4, a negative regulator of T cells through Eomes activation. We have generated pancreatic cancer transgenic animals that lack B7-H4 and found that KC; B7-H4<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice have delayed tumorigenesis and decreased immunosuppression. In sum, we describe a novel IL-17-mediated regulation of B7-H4 and unravel its function in pancreatic tumorigenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-12 Tumor-immune system interactions ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-17,Interleukin-17RA,B7-H4,Mouse models,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Susana Castro Pando<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Le Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Rian Morgan Howel<sup>1<\/sup>, Marilina Mascaro<sup>1<\/sup>, Olivereen Le Roux<sup>1<\/sup>, David Romanin<sup>1<\/sup>, Erick Riquelme<sup>1<\/sup>, Yu Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Jay Kolls<sup>2<\/sup>, Seyed Javad Moghaddam<sup>3<\/sup>, Florencia McAllister<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Clinical Cancer Prevention, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Medicine, Tulane University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Immunology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ebbbd99a-4c24-4a14-a468-1b74864a11e7","ControlNumber":"6484","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

We could previously show that TAM family receptor tyrosine kinase MERTK exerts an oncogenic function in multiple myeloma, NSCLC and breast cancer bone metastasis, providing a rationale for using MERTK inhibitors in bone metastasis therapy. Furthermore, we reported a thus far unrecognized role of MERTK as a novel negative regulator of osteoblast function and showed that MERTK represents an osteoanabolic target in the tumor microenvironment of bone metastasis by targeting osteoblasts. It is described that MERTK exerts a prominent role in phagocytosis of macrophages. Nevertheless, the role of MERTK in osteoclasts is unknown. To assess a potential role of MERTK in physiological bone remodeling by osteoclasts <i>in vivo<\/i>, we performed microcomputed tomography (&#956;CT) of tibia of <i>LysM-cre<sup>+<\/sup>;Mertk<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup><\/i> mice and observed increased bone volume. Histomorphometry revealed reduced osteoclast number in <i>LysM-cre<sup>+<\/sup>;Mertk<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup><\/i> mice, indicating that increased bone volume induced by loss of MERTK in the myeloid lineage is mediated by decreased osteoclast formation <i>in vivo<\/i>. Interestingly, analysis of TRAP<sup>+ <\/sup>mononuclear cells in the metaphyseal bone marrow showed decreased numbers and increased distance to closest bone surface, suggesting dysfunctional osteoclast precursor cell differentiation and migration in<i> LysM-cre<sup>+<\/sup>;Mertk<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup><\/i> mice. <i>In vitro <\/i>assays demonstrated that loss of <i>Mertk<\/i> results in decreased osteoclast precursor cell migration towards its ligand PROS1 and decreased osteoclast differentiation through a RHOA dependent mechanism. To elucidate if MERTK represents a target in the tumor microenvironment of osteolytic bone metastasis we utilized syngeneic EO771 breast cancer bone metastasis model and injected luciferase transduced EO771 cells into <i>Mertk<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup><\/i> and <i>LysM-cre<sup>+<\/sup>;Mertk<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>C57BL\/6J mice. Metastatic spread was monitored by bioluminescence imaging. Analysis of bone metastasis by &#956;CT showed higher bone volume in EO771 tumor bearing <i>LysM-cre<sup>+<\/sup>;Mertk<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup><\/i> mice. Furthermore, osteolysis zones in the cortical bone were markedly decreased. Histomorphometry of TRAP\/Hematoxylin staining indicated decreased osteoclast numbers in EO771 tumor bearing <i>LysM-cre<sup>+<\/sup>;Mertk<sup>flox\/flox<\/sup><\/i> mice. Furthermore, intratumoral TRAP<sup>+<\/sup> mononuclear cells in breast cancer bone metastases were decreased, indicating that osteolytic bone metastasis recruit osteoclast precursors from its microenvironment in the bone marrow via MERTK to induce osteolysis. In summary, tumor-induced activation of MERTK suppresses and transforms osteoblasts, which counteracts bone formation and recruits osteoclast precursors to form osteoclasts and mediate osteolysis. Hence, MERTK is a novel target in the tumor microenvironment to inhibit osteolytic bone metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-08 Organ-specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bone metastasis,Osteoclast,Osteoblast,Receptors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Janik Engelmann<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jennifer Zarrer<sup>2<\/sup>, Kristoffer Riecken<sup>3<\/sup>, Jonas Waizenegger<sup>4<\/sup>, Maria Elena Vargas-Delgado<sup>4<\/sup>, Lara Meier<sup>4<\/sup>, Carsten Bokemeyer<sup>5<\/sup>, Klaus Pantel<sup>6<\/sup>, Emily Alberto<sup>7<\/sup>, Sourav Ghosh<sup>8<\/sup>, Carla Rothlin<sup>9<\/sup>, Eric Hesse<sup>2<\/sup>, Hanna Taipaleenmäki<sup>2<\/sup>, Isabel Ben-Batalla*<sup>4<\/sup>, Sonja Loges* (*equal contribution)<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; DKFZ-Hector Cancer Institute, University Medical Center Mannheim, Hamburg, Germany,<sup>2<\/sup>Institute of Musculoskeletal Medicine, LMU Munich, Martinsried, Germany,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, Research Department Cell and Gene Therapy, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany,<sup>4<\/sup>DKFZ-Hector Cancer Institute, University Medical Center Mannheim; German Cancer Research Center; University Hospital Mannheim, Medical Faculty Mannheim, University Heidelberg, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Heidelberg, Germany,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany,<sup>6<\/sup>Institute of Tumor Biology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany,<sup>7<\/sup>Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT,<sup>8<\/sup>Department of Pharmacology, Department of Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT,<sup>9<\/sup>Department of Immunobiology, Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"769f8456-3f81-4403-afb7-0e0279b7502c","ControlNumber":"1047","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

While a diverse array of primary tumors may result in LM, recent work from our laboratory (Chi Y et al 2020 Science) demonstrates a conserved transcriptional signature, independent of primary tumor, suggesting that tumor-microenvironmental interactions play a dominant role in this pathology. We have proteomically interrogated CSF collected from breast (n = 45), lung (n = 30), and melanoma (n = 27) patients with and without LM. We detect robust expression of inflammatory cytokines in all LM+ samples, 15 of these cytokines including IL8, IL6, and CXCL1 are conserved across tumor types in the presence of LM. Because cancer cells in the CSF do not express mRNA associated with these cytokines, we hypothesized that these inflammatory cytokines may originate from the microenvironment. Within the leptomeninges, LM cells adhere to and interact with the innermost layer of the meninges, the pia mater, which contains fibroblast-like cells. Co-culture of cancer cells with pial cells induced changes in the pial cell transcriptome and secretome, leading to increased IL8, IL6, and CXCL1 production. This communication between cancer cells and pial cells is preserved in the absence of direct cell-cell contact. To identify cancer cell signal(s) responsible for these pial cell changes, we subjected cancer cell conditioned media to gel filtration, and uncovered TGFBI as a key secreted factor inducing pial cell transcriptional changes. These pial cells support cancer cell growth <i>in vivo<\/i>, as measured by co-implantation experiments. In autopsy samples, we detect IL8, IL6, and CXCL1 expression in the pia of patients harboring LM. Taken together, these observations support a cancer-associated-fibroblast like role for pial cells in the setting of LM. We are currently carrying out single cell RNA sequencing of both human and mouse LM samples to capture heterogeneity in both cancer and pial cell responses, and to place these cells in the larger context of the CAF knowledgebase. Our work extends the CAF phenotype beyond classical fibroblasts to include pial cells, suggesting novel therapeutic opportunities within CNS malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-11 Tumor\/stromal interactions,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer associated fibroblasts,Metastasis,Tumor microenvironment,Cell signaling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jenna Snyder<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jan Remsik<sup>1<\/sup>, Nicholas Prescott<sup>2<\/sup>, Adrienne Boire<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, NY,<sup>2<\/sup>Tri-Institutional PhD Program, New York City, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"adacd67e-1a05-4b99-bee6-ca3f9b806d81","ControlNumber":"4046","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

The goal of our research is to use a 3D in vitro model to acquire in-depth understanding on the unique environment of brain tumors in order to find new biomarkers of disease and develop more efficient therapeutic approaches. Brain extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a key role in glioblastoma invasion and therapeutic resistance. In particular, the aberrant biosynthesis of the main component of brain ECM, hyaluronic acid (HA), has been associated to pathological conditions. In this study, we investigate the influence of tumor extracellular microenvironment in glioblastoma progression. We focus here on the tumor-associated HA biosynthesis in response to biophysical alterations, such as hypoxia and stiffness, and after radio and chemotherapeutic interventions. The ability to manipulate tumor ECM can improve therapeutic outcomes and restrict glioblastoma growth and infiltration.We have established engineered brain tumor biomaterials based on functionalized gelatin hydrogels decorated with covalently bound HA. This biomaterial approach can monitor the response of patient-derived xenograft cell populations with different molecular signatures (1, 2) in combination with microfluidic devices. Here, we characterized tumor cell response to targeted inhibitors and ionizing radiation. We quantified HA molecular weight (MW) distribution of secreted HA, and the tumor cell response to inhibition of HA synthase 2 (HAS2) and hyaluronidase (Hyal).Analysis of HA biosynthesis suggests that GBM cells compensate for a lack of matrix-bound HA by producing soluble HA to stimulate invasion. Moreover, we revealed that different signaling pathways are altered in the tumor cells depending on the microenvironment as they respond to an EGFR and CD44 inhibitor. While the decrease in invasion and proliferation in gelatin-only matrices comes from the negative regulation of ERK pathway, HA plays a favorable role in the inhibition of EGFR, through STAT3 deactivation (3).The MW and abundance of HA are mediated by the activity of HA synthases and hyaluronidases. These enzymes vary in expression, rate, and MW of the HA produced. We have found a heterogeneous profile of MW distributions secreted by different tumor types when exposed to different targeted inhibitors. We have also shown an increase in HA secretion after exposure to radiation and inhibition of hyaluronidase, also associated to significant changes in cell proliferation. The oxidative stress induced by the hypoxic environment also induces the production of hyaluronic acid and significantly affects glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, that are further altered by the molecular weight of the HA present in the extracellular space.(1) Pedron S.

Here, we aim to identify the metabolic and immune remodeling of the tumor leptomeningeal microenvironment in Non-Hodgkin lymphoma through comprehensive multi-omic analysis of patient specimens, <i>in vivo<\/i> models, and <i>in vitro<\/i> functional studies.Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from leptomeningeal lymphoma (LML) patients and tumor-free controls were collected and analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq), metabolomics, proteomics, and lipidomics. Patients&#8217; CSF cellular components were highly enriched with heterogeneous B-cell populations. Few T-lymphocytes in LML patients showed expression of activation or proliferation markers. Poor prognosis was associated with significant infiltration of macrophages and a lack of dendritic cells. These findings were confirmed to be unique to LML using immune-competent animal models where tumor cells were injected intrathecally, and into lymph nodes. Moreover, LML patients&#8217; CSF showed an accumulation of branched-chain keto-acids (BKAs), which are well-known neurotoxins, metabotoxins, and acidogens. Absolute quantification of individual BKAs was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography and showed a 30-fold increase in LML patients&#8217; CSF.To investigate the effect of BKAs accumulation on T-lymphocytes, we examined their viability, proliferation, and activation with BKAs treatment in the context of physiological CSF. Cell trace violet-labeled T lymphocytes showed a significant reduction in proliferation and viability with increasing doses of BKAs. Additionally, a significant decline in the secretion of TNF-&#945;, interferon-&#947;, granzyme B, and IL-2 was found using ELISA assays, indicating a reduction in T-lymphocyte activation.The proteomic and lipidomic analysis of patients&#8217; CSF also revealed a significant downregulation in proteins and lipids vital for neuronal development, synaptic organization, and myelin sheath integrity. Similarly, scRNA-Seq of the leptomeningeal layer collected from the LML mouse<i> <\/i>model revealed compromised leptomeningeal integrity. Neurological scoring of the LML mouse model showed disease progression to be associated with rapid neurological decline. To investigate the direct effect of BKAs on the leptomeningeal and neuronal integrity, we tested different concentrations of BKAs on murine primary neuronal cells and human leptomeningeal cells (HMC). MTT assays showed a significant reduction in HMC metabolic activity after 72 hours and in neuronal metabolic activity after 7 days. In conclusion, our data unveil the immunosuppressive and neurodegenerative role of BKAs in the leptomeningeal tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-08 Organ-specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lymphoma: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Leptomeningeal Lymphoma,Branched chain keto acids,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mariam Lotfy Khaled<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Gerald Wallace<sup>2<\/sup>, Brittany Evernden<sup>2<\/sup>, Zhihua Chen<sup>3<\/sup>, Hasan Alhaddad<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuan Ren<sup>1<\/sup>, Oscar Ospina<sup>3<\/sup>, Maclean.

While our previous studies showed cholinergic signaling promoted gastric cancer and vagal denervation inhibited gastric cancer, it is noteworthy that sensory nerves comprise 80% of the vagal axons. To investigate the role of sensory innervation in gastric carcinogenesis, we performed retrograde neural tracing and identified CGRP+ peptidergic neurons in nodose ganglia and dorsal root ganglia as primary gastric sensory neurons. While VAChT+ parasympathetic nerves are the main nerves innervating the normal stomach, CGRP+ sensory nerves show the greatest degree of expansion in mouse gastric tumors. Indeed, mouse gastric tumors show upregulation of NGF, a growth factor essential for sensory nerve survival, and gastric NGF overexpression in an NGF knock-in mouse also resulted in increased sensory innervation. Inhibition of NGF\/Trk signaling by Entrectinib markedly attenuates NGF-dependent sensory nerve expansion. In addition to overall increased axonogenesis of sensory nerves, mouse models of gastric cancer showed upregulation of &#945;CGRP peptide in gastric tumors and Calca mRNA in gastric sensory neurons, indicating increased activation of sensory neurons during gastric carcinogenesis. To study the effect of such activation, sensory neurons were then directly activated by treatment of Trpv1-Cre;hM3Dq mice with clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), which led to marked gastric hyperplasia with increased proliferation. Interestingly, in an acetic acid-induced ulcer model, activation of sensory neurons reduced the ulcer size and strongly promoted gland regeneration. Activation of sensory neurons, in a syngeneic, orthotopic model of gastric cancer in the Trpv1-Cre;hM3Dq mice, led to a significant increase in tumor volume, Ki-67+ cancer cells, CD31+ vessels and M2 macrophage polarization, as well as decreased CD8+ T cells. Analysis of available single-cell transcriptome data from mouse and human stomach showed that Calcrl\/Ramp1 (CGRP receptors) are expressed in gastric epithelial cells and most stromal cells, while the expression levels of Tacr1 (receptor for Substance P) and Sstr1-5 (receptors for Somatostatin) were much lower. Importantly, some Calcrl\/Ramp1+ cells are proliferative cells with strong Ki-67 expression. Our data show that Calcrl is also overexpressed in mouse gastric tumors, while TCGA data reveals significant upregulation of CALCRL in human gastric cancers and that high expression of CALCRL is correlated with poor overall survival. Finally, we established a co-culture model using DRGs and gastric cancer organoids, and found that sensory nerves can generate synaptic-like terminals on cancer organoids. In conclusion, our data indicate that sensory innervation directly promotes gastric cancer growth and also modulates the tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-08 Organ-specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Microenvironment,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xiaofei Zhi<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Feijing Wu<sup><\/sup>, Jin Qian<sup><\/sup>, Yosuke Ochiai<sup><\/sup>, Guodong Lian<sup><\/sup>, Ermanno Malagola<sup><\/sup>, Timothy  C.

How the TME is orchestrated by precancerous lesions, primary GAC, and in metastatic niches, when well understood, may propel us into an entirely new dimension with the hopes of novel therapeutics. However, only a few studies have investigated the immune\/stromal subtypes of GAC with the limitation of scope, cohort size, and\/or depth or mainly focused on the primary GACs. Here, we present an atlas of transcriptionally diverse TME across the full continuum of GAC by including peripheral blood, normal gastric tissues, premalignant lesions, localized, and metastatic GACs.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>We performed a comprehensive single-cell profiling of 68 specimens collected from 43 subjects including a total of 77,392 high-quality cells which revealed 62 unique cell states uncovering varying profiles. We defined alterations in TMEs that underscore initiation of tumorigenesis to eventual progression.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We found a striking preponderance of B lineage cells, primarily the IgA+ plasma cells, in TMEs of the precancerous lesions, whereas 3 immunosuppressive myeloid subsets dominated in advanced GACs. Fractions of GZMK+ effector CD8 T cells and progenitor exhausted CD8 T cells gradually increased as GACs progressed to advanced stages. In addition, our analysis revealed extensive stromal remodeling along the GAC continuum, which may have contributed to enhanced angiogenesis and immune suppressive signaling. The observations in the primary tumors could be validated in an independent scRNA-seq dataset. Notably, we uncovered 3 unique TME interactomes and defined 6 cellular environtypes inhabited by 62 TME cell subsets giving GAC to a novel landscape not yet defined. The two distinct environtypes in GAC primaries are validated in three independent large-scale GAC cohorts, giving credence and definition to previously established histopathological variables, genomic\/molecular subtypes and clinical outcomes. The analysis of tumor associated stromal cells discovered <i>SDC2<\/i> as an<br \/>exploitable target to pursue. <i>SDC2<\/i> was abundant in cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and the abundance is validated in 3 independent single-cell GAC cohorts as well as at the protein level. <i>SDC2<\/i> expression was significantly higher in advanced (vs. early) stages and diffuse (vs. intestinal) type of GAC, and <i>SDC2<\/i> overexpression was associated with shorter survival in all 5 large-scale GAC cohorts. Lastly, we assessed the functional effects of <i>SDC2<\/i> expression in CAFs on tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i> in xenograft models and found <i>SDC2<\/i> overexpression in CAFs contributes to tumor growth.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>This study provides an atlas of GAC TMEs from tumorigenesis to advanced GAC that could be further developed for novel therapeutics but also serves as a community resource.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB11-08 Organ-specific microenvironments,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Single cell,Tumor microenvironment,Peritoneal metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ruiping Wang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Shumei Song<sup>1<\/sup>, Jiangjiang Qin<sup>2<\/sup>, Katsuhiro Yoshimura<sup>1<\/sup>, Fuduan Peng<sup>1<\/sup>, Yanshuo Chu<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuan Li<sup>3<\/sup>, Yibo Fan<sup>1<\/sup>, Jiankang Jin<sup>1<\/sup>, Minghao Dang<sup>1<\/sup>, Enyu Dai<sup>1<\/sup>, Guangsheng Pei<sup>1<\/sup>, Guangchun Han<sup>1<\/sup>, Yating Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Deyali Chatterjee<sup>1<\/sup>, Melissa  P.
