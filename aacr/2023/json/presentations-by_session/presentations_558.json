While sequencing of tens of thousands of clinical samples has revealed a vast set of cancer drivers, far less is known about the interactions of oncogene-tumor suppressor pairs. Due to patient-level selection bias, confounding biological factors and limited sample sizes, a map of these interactions cannot be generated from human data alone and, instead, requires direct perturbational experiments and functional genomics approaches.<br \/>Here, we model and quantify tumors using an autochthonous mouse platform and Tubaseq, which integrates barcoded lentiviral-sgRNA\/Cre vectors and high-throughput barcode sequencing to uncover the number of neoplastic cells in each tumor of each genotype. Across four oncogenic contexts&#8212;KRAS G12D, KRAS G12C, BRAF V600E, and EGFR L858R&#8212;we analyzed &#62;10,000,000 tumors to estimate the tumorigenesis potential of the oncogene alone as well as the effect of inactivating 28 tumor suppressor genes.<br \/>We discovered that despite KRAS G12D producing &#62;10x the tumors as G12C, tumor suppressor inactivations provide similar growth effects on both backgrounds. In contrast, although the intrinsic abilities of BRAF V600E and EGFR L858R to drive tumor development fall within the range of the KRAS variants, tumor suppressive effects are categorically different in the context of each oncogene.<br \/>Many tumor suppressors show clear sign epistasis with the oncogenes, whereby inactivation is advantageous in one context and neutral or deleterious in another. Inactivation of some of the strongest tumor suppressors (e.g., <i>Lkb1<\/i>, <i>Setd2<\/i>, and <i>Kmt2d<\/i>) in <i>KRAS<\/i>-driven tumors strongly decreases tumor growth in the presence of oncogenic EGFR. While some of these epistatic effects are consistent with a textbook understanding of the RAS pathway, most cannot be predicted based on the linear oncogenic EGFR &#8594; KRAS &#8594; BRAF pathway model.<br \/>Analyses of clinical genomics data from AACR Project GENIE confirm that high rates of passenger mutations in <i>KRAS<\/i>- and <i>BRAF<\/i>-driven lung tumors, among other factors,<i> <\/i>prevent the discovery of these interactions from human data alone. However, for <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant lung cancers, which are less confounded by high mutational burden, the rates of coincident tumor suppressor mutation are highly correlated with tumor growth effects in our <i>in vivo<\/i> model.<br \/>Thus, we find via causal experiments that the landscape of tumor suppression is highly dependent on oncogenic context, with a <i>minority<\/i> of tumor suppressive effects robust to changes in the oncogene. These findings suggest that the utility of a specific cancer mutation as a prognostic or predictive biomarker of patient outcomes will be dependent on coincident mutations in the tumor and highlight the utility of high-throughput, quantitative autochthonous mouse models in advancing our understanding of cancer biology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor suppressor gene,AACR Project GENIE,Oncogene,Tumor biology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lily  M.

We aimed to explore the clinic-genomic landscape of alterations currently actionable by tissue-agnostic targeted therapies.<br \/>Methods: We mined AACR Project GENIE to extract data about three molecular targets currently on the list of FDA tissue-agnostic approvals (<i>RET <\/i>fusions, <i>NTRK <\/i>fusions, and <i>BRAFV600E <\/i>mutations).<br \/>Results: Among 137401 patients in GENIE database (153,834 samples), 4506 samples harbored <i>BRAFV600E <\/i>mutations (3%), 390 had <i>NTRK <\/i>fusions (0.3%), and 375 had <i>RET <\/i>fusions (0.2%) (Table 1). Cancers with <i>BRAFV600E <\/i>mutations included melanoma (n=1278; 28%), CRC (n=1120; 25%), thyroid cancer (n=845; 19%), glioma (n=359; 8%), NSCLC (n=300; 7%); and multiple other tumor types (n=1882; 42%). The most frequent co-occurring alterations were <i>TERT <\/i>and <i>TP53<\/i>. <i>NTRK <\/i>fusions were observed in breast cancer (n=42; 11%), glioma (n=37; 10%), thyroid cancer (n=37; 10%), soft tissue sarcomas (n=34; 9%), and NSCLC (n=32; 8%); among others (n=208; 53%). The most common fusion partners were <i>ETV6<\/i>, <i>TPM3<\/i>, and <i>LMNA<\/i> and most frequent co-occurring mutations were <i>TP53 <\/i>and <i>TERT<\/i>. <i>RET <\/i>fusions were seen in NSCLC (n=208; 56%), thyroid cancer (n=88; 24%), CRC (n=15; 4%), breast cancer (n=11; 3%), and gastroesophageal cancer (n=8; 2%); among others (n=45; 12%). Common fusion partners were were <i>KIF5B, CCDC6, and NCOA4 and <\/i>most frequent co-occurring alterations were <i>TP53 and SETD2<\/i>.<br \/>Conclusions: <i>BRAF, RET and NTRK <\/i>alterations are prevalent across multiple tumors. Although rare, together they are found in around 3.4% of all human cancers. Further analysis of co-occurring TP53, TERT and SETD2 alterations and their impact on response to targeted therapies is warranted, in order to tailor personalized treatments for patients harboring these alterations.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{28EAAF31-F83E-4FFB-8F2F-450C2AAB1C1A}\"><caption>Table 1: Tissue spectrum of activity for anticancer drugs with

Because RWE comprises large, diverse, and incomplete data entries (e.g., missing treatments, survival endpoints, response), however, its impact can be limited. We introduce a deep learning AI framework designed to utilize diverse types and qualities of available RWE data, demonstrating its potential application in the clinical setting. The deep learning framework was built on top of transformer architecture to maximize the value of large, unlabeled RWE data for predicting patient survival. The framework has two stages. (1) Pre-training, an oracle model is trained by using the GENIE v.11 data set (N = 136,000), including 2,290 variables via standard masked self-supervised learning. (2) Transfer learning, the oracle&#8217;s weights are transferred to a survival model that has the same architecture but outputs a survival score. This model is fine-tuned to predict patient survival and is optimized using the sigmoid approximation of Harrell&#8217;s concordance index. The survival model is benchmarked independently across four different immunooncology (IO) and hormone therapy (HT) data sets: pan-cancer (IO, N = 1610), lung cancer from MSK MIND (IO, N = 246) and the MYSTIC trial (IO, N = 325), and melanoma (IO, N = 110) and breast cancer from METABRIC (HT, N = 1981). We built two survival models per data set, with (+) and without (-) transfer learning. Models were evaluated using the concordance index (CI) on 10 training (80%)\/testing (20%) splits. Transfer learning from the GENIE data set consistently improved patient survival prediction in almost all the data sets evaluated in this study: pan-cancer data set: from CI(-) = 0.63 &#177; 0.015 in 86 epochs to CI(+) = 0.65 &#177; 0.023 in 23 epochs, patient stratification from HR(-) = 0.52 (0.35-0.78) to HR(+) = 0.34 (0.22-0.53; MSK MIND from a CI(-) = 0.56 &#177; 0.023 in 57 epochs to CI(+) = 0.59 &#177; 0.031 in 23 epochs; MYSTIC trial: from a CI(-) = 0.56 &#177; 0.052 in 95 epochs to CI(+) = 0.60 &#177; 0.05 in 38 epochs; melanoma from a CI(-) = 0.59 &#177; 0.1 in 85 epochs to CI(+) = 0.63 &#177; 0.07 in 38 epochs; and METABRIC from a CI(-) = 0.60 &#177; 0.016 in 62 epochs to CI(+) = 0.59 &#177; 0.012 in 15 epochs. In addition, the models with transfer learning trained 2.5 times faster. Our framework leverages the value of RWE data sets, such as GENIE, to enhance the utilization of complex modeling approaches for small clinical data sets. In systems where multiple players, such as, host immune system, patient health, and tumor biology are all contributing to patient&#8217;s response to treatment, complex modeling such as deep learning is essential to capture these convoluted relationships . We anticipate that our framework has the potential to set the path for improved predictions of patient survival in clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS01-03 Artificial intelligence and machine\/deep learning,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Deep learning,Immuno-oncology,AACR Project GENIE,Transfer Learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Gustavo Arango-Argoty<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Etai Jacob<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Oncology Data Science, AstraZeneca, Waltham, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9116d486-768e-4603-b00c-4f9e391b1d06","ControlNumber":"8072","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;G.

However, conditional activation of signaling pathways as a new source of selective cancer vulnerabilities has not been systematically characterized. In this study, we sought to systematically identify context-specific gene activation lethalities in cancer. We performed lineage-specific mutual-exclusivity (ME) analysis using 69,393 cancer patient genomes in cohorts of AACR-GENIE, TCGA, and Foundation One, across 12 cancer lineages, and identified ME mutation pairs within MAPK, PI3K and WNT pathways indicative of evolutionarily negative selection. To functionally test whether mutual exclusive genetic alterations likely create negative selection pressures in cancer, we developed a lentiviral method to achieve simultaneous ectopic ORF expression ~500 barcoded cancer cell lines for large-scale gain-of-function genetic perturbation. Using this technology, we systematically profiled the pan-cancer vulnerability landscape upon activating 10 key pathway nodes, revealing selective activation dependencies associated with specific biomarkers. We validated the anti-tumor effect of PI3K hyperactivation in PIK3CA\/PTEN double-mutant endometrial cancer cell lines. Notably, we find that subsets of APC-mutant colorectal cancers retain active destruction complexes. Upon further depletion of APC or direct expression of &#946;-catenin, the resulting WNT pathway hyperactivation impairs the viability of APC-mutant colorectal cancers in <i>in vitro<\/i> cell lines and organoids and in <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor models. Together, our study reveals a new class of conditional gene activation dependencies in cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-04 Large-scale approaches to cancer gene discovery,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer genomics,Colorectal cancer,AACR Project GENIE,Target discovery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Liang Chang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Nancy  Y.

To facilitate the systematic identification of likely oncogenic versus benign somatic mutations, there has been a growing interest in harnessing additional computationally amenable metrics such as sequence paralogy. Here, we developed a novel paralogy-directed computational methodology called Enriched Paralogy to identify Occult Cancer Hotspots (EPOCH), which calculates the significance of mutational recurrence at aligned positions in evolutionarily related genes to prioritize likely oncogenic mutations for in depth functional characterization. We validated the utility of EPOCH using sequencing data from a cohort of 52,676 tumor\/normal pairs, with a focus on identifying likely oncogenic mutations in the well characterized <i>PIK3CA<\/i> (p110&#945;) class 1a PI3K isoform and the lesser characterized <i>PIK3CD<\/i> (p110&#948;) isoform. p110&#948; mutants nominated as likely oncogenic by EPOCH induced AKT pathway activation, enhanced anchorage-independent colony formation, and demonstrated allele-specific dependencies on p85 regulatory protein binding. The potency of PI3K inhibitors against p110&#948; mutants was at best equal to or less than wildtype p110&#948;. In sum, we present the novel algorithm EPOCH that integrates paralogy to extend the utility of current recurrence-based precision oncology predictions and to automate the functional interpretation of less common mutations. Our work identifies novel oncogenic and targetable p110&#948; mutants and supports the inclusion of <i>PIK3CD<\/i> in targeted sequencing panels despite the relative rarity of mutations in this gene. The therapeutic studies herein also provide the rationale for the development and clinical testing of isoform- or mutant-specific p110&#948; inhibitors for patients with rare, yet druggable, oncogenic p110&#948; mutations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++MCB08-01 Functional genomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"AACR Project GENIE,paralogy,PIK3CD,hotspot,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Arijh Elzein<sup>1<\/sup>, Alexander  N.

A better understanding of the molecular features of EOCRC is needed.<br \/>Methods: The AACR GENIE Biopharma Collaborative CRC 1.2-consortium dataset consists of clinical and genomic data from a cohort of CRC patients (pts) with next generation tumor sequencing (55-500 genes) from 2015 to 2017 at three academic centers. Imaging reports and medical oncology notes were retrospectively curated. EOCRC was defined as age at diagnosis &#60; 50 years; while later onset CRC (LOCRC) as &#8805; 50 years. Association with clinical variables was analyzed using Chi-Square or Fisher&#8217;s exact test. Associations with genomic alterations were analyzed using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for multiple testing; the associations were evaluated among the overall study population and by stage. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the median overall survival (OS) and was adjusted to left truncation bias introduced by the inclusion criteria for this project.<br \/>Results: A total of 1507 pts with CRC, 519 (34%) with EOCRC, were analyzed. EOCRC pts were more likely to be diagnosed with Stage IV than LOCRC (51% vs 44%, p&#60;0.01). Left-sided primary tumors were more frequent in EOCRC (73% vs 57%, p&#60;0.01). Among stage I-III, EOCRC was associated with longer OS compared to LOCRC (HR:1.43, 95%CI 1.07-1.91, p=0.01). Among stage IV CRC, no differences were observed in OS between EOCRC and LOCRC in a multivariate analysis including <i>RAS\/BRAF<\/i> mutation (mt), MSI and liver, lung and peritoneal metastasis (HR: 1.01, 95% CI 0.8-1.28, p=0.92). The proportion of <i>BRAF<\/i> mt was higher in LOCRC (15 vs 7%, p&#60;0.01), mainly in stage I-III (17% vs 7%, p=0.01). This association is significant after adjusting for tumor sidedness (OR: 1.77 95% CI 1.19-2.63, p&#60;0.01). <i>BRAF<\/i> V600E mt is more frequent in LOCRC (11 vs 3%, p&#60;0.01). <i>APC <\/i>and <i>PI3KCA<\/i> mt are more common in EOCRC, but only among right-sided tumors. There were not significant differences in copy number alterations or structural variants. <i>APC<\/i>, <i>TP53<\/i>, <i>KRAS<\/i>, <i>BRAF<\/i> and <i>PI3KCA<\/i> were analyzed according to stage. Among EOCRC, <i>TP53<\/i> mt was more frequent in stage IV vs I-III (79 vs 70%, p=0.02). In LOCRC, both <i>TP53<\/i> (76% vs 69%, p=0.01) and<i> KRAS<\/i> mt (47 vs 38%, p&#60;0.01) were more frequent in stage IV vs I-III. Effect modification of the association between these genes and OS by age of onset was explored using an interaction test in stage IV and I-III. <i>APC <\/i>mt in stage I-III conferred better prognosis in EOCRC (HR 0.31 (0.18-0.51) for EOCRC; HR 0.72 (0.51-1.01) for LOCRC; interaction p&#60;0.01).<br \/><i><\/i>Conclusions: EOCRC does not show significant genomic differences from LOCRC except for lower frequency of <i>BRAF<\/i> mt. For right-sided tumors, <i>APC<\/i> and <i>PI3KCA<\/i> mt are more common in EOCRC. <i>APC<\/i> mt in stage I-III is associated with a better prognosis in EOCRC.

Furthermore, the &#8220;curse of dimensionality,&#8221; in which data has many features, such as genetic variants, but few specimens, makes it difficult or impossible to use conventional machine learning techniques to explore these data. To address these challenges in the context of tumors associated with the rare disease neurofibromatosis, we ran a hackathon to stimulate the development of methods to better understand the biology of tumors related to this disease. The hackathon had three challenges centered around variant effect prediction, drug discovery, and genomics. The genomics track of the hackathon leveraged the AACR Project GENIE database (1) and challenged participants to develop new frameworks that accurately use GENIE data to classify neurofibromatosis-related tumors. They were asked to first identify the neurofibromatosis-related tumors in the dataset. They were then asked to use one or more novel classification methods to classify the tumor samples into different groups based on genetic features. To help them do this, we provided access to version 13 of the GENIE database to the hackathon participants, though they were allowed to integrate other relevant datasets. The expected output was a classification method that differentiates different types of NF1, NF2, and schwannomatosis-related tumors using clinical sequencing data, as well as a list of the most important features in the algorithm for differentiating tumor types. Domain expert judges qualitatively scored each team&#8217;s rationale for defining and including &#8220;NF-related tumors&#8221; in their project, and scored the feature list based on the presence of known important biomarkers and features in NF tumors as well as potentially novel features that the algorithm identified. A technical judge also scored the code repository based on documentation and clarity of code. Two teams from the GENIE subchallenge were awarded prizes - Team Next GeNLP as the best overall GENIE challenge submission, and team &#8220;Artificial Intelligence for neurofibromatosis&#8221; for best project documentation. Both winning teams used methods based on natural language processing (NLP) techniques to reduce the dimensionality and complexity of the variant data, and to identify new representations of NF-relevant tumors, and then applied downstream analysis methods such as distance calculations and feature prioritization to better understand the genomic profiles of different tumors. While these methods and tools focused on NF-specific tumor types, we anticipate that they could be re-used by others to better explore the biology and interrelatedness of other rare tumors within the GENIE database.<br \/><ol>(1) The AACR Project GENIE Consortium.
