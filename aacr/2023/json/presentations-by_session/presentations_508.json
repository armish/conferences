[{"Abstract":"Despite having the best survival among the molecular subtypes, estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer has a tendency for late recurrence. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are responsible for disease recurrence by seeding tumors at secondary sites. We have previously developed a CTC signature of 90 common regions of gene copy number gain and demonstrated that this signature is significantly more widespread among cells in metastases than primary tumors.<sup> 1,2<\/sup> The objective of our current work is to establish whether the expression data from a 133 gene panel largely derived from the CTC signature can be used to assess the risk of recurrence (ROR) in early ER+ breast cancer patients to help guide treatment decisions following surgery. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) ER+ breast tumor biopsies and linked normal (control) tissues from 192 patients are being analyzed with a custom NanoString nCounter probe set of our 133 CTC genes. From data gathered to date, several genes were shown to be significantly overexpressed in tumors compared to reference normal tissues. This includes MMP11, MKI67, LILRB4, UBE2T, BIRC5, CDC6, MYBL2, and NUF2, which had a log<sub>2<\/sub> fold-change of at least 3.5 (n = 34, p &#60; 0.01). The correlation of our CTC genes to ROR is being evaluated by comparison to the results of the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score Test, a well-established clinical test for ROR in ER+ breast cancer, for each patient. So far, it has been shown that the intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) of CTC genes as established by DEPTH2, an ITH algorithm which evaluates mRNA levels, is significantly positively corelated to Oncotype DX score (n = 23, r = 0.41, p = 0.0495). Moving forward, we will create our own ROR scoring system based on gene expression and copy number data from the CTC gene panel and validate it by comparison to Oncotype DX score and other available clinical data for each of the 192 patient samples. The goal of our work is to gain a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive metastasis and recurrence in ER+ breast cancer by focusing on CTCs which play a pivotal role in driving these events.<br \/>1.

In order to study functional consequences of this heterogeneity, we applied single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell Multi-ome (RNA+ATAC) on hormone responsive cell line and organoid models after multiple timepoint hormone treatments. We also developed TITAN, an LDA based machine learning tool to identify &#8216;cell states&#8217; in single-cell datasets. Our results suggest that response to hormone signalling is highly heterogenous at the single-cell level, resulting in multiple divergent epigenetic and transcriptional cell states. We identified driver transcription factors for these states and defined epigenetic mechanisms regulating state change. Subsequently, we also investigated epigenetic and transcriptional states in primary breast tumors. We analysed 20 breast tumor samples using the single-cell Multi-ome (ATAC+RNA) approach and compared them to matched adjacent normal tissues. Our results identified epigenetic reprogramming events in breast cancer and novel transcription factors in the process. Using bulk DNA-sequencing as a reference, we inferred sub-clonal populations from both the RNA and ATAC modalities, allowing us to define heterogenous chromatin accessibility events that align with genetic sub-clones as well as those that are independent of it. Our dataset provides a comprehensive view of epigenetic and transcriptional events in breast tumorigenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,Multiomics,Breast cancer,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hisham Mohammed<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3abe9438-5061-4f54-a56e-064987764573","ControlNumber":"8012","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

Notably, a large subset of patients present with a unique chromosome 3 copy-loss event, which is highly associated with metastatic progression in late-stage disease. To date, the biology underlying the causes and consequences of this unique copy-loss event (Monosomy 3 or M3), and its role in promoting metastases remains largely unexplored. This can be attributed to both the lack of preclinical models and in-depth characterization of paired primary and metastatic tumors in patients. To address this, we derived a preclinical isogenic model of chromosome 3 copy-loss through CRISPR-based centromere targeting in a well characterized Disomy 3 UM cell line. Isogenic Disomy (D3) and Monosomy (M3) clones derived from these efforts have enabled us to develop patient derived xenograft (PDX) models to compare D3 and M3 behavior in paired, <i>in vivo<\/i>, primary and metastatic settings. This modeling has enabled us to employ spatial transcriptomics in a PDX setting to characterize gene expression signatures across unique D3 and M3 UM clones. Investigation of metastatic UM tumor heterogeneity in our models enables us to characterize unique features of phenotypically transformed clones (e.g. depigmentation and growth advantage). We have also adapted existing methodology to infer chromosomal copy number events from spatial transcriptomics data to our PDX system, where we are able to overcome the lack of same-species microenvironment controls. Our methodology allows for deep characterization of sub-clonal heterogeneity in both D3 and M3 settings and informs on the unique biology underlying invasiveness and outgrowth of M3 tumors. Finally, we complement our preclinical analyses with an investigation of spatial heterogeneity in a patient cohort of paired primary and metastatic tumors. More broadly, comparing these D3 vs. M3 signatures provides an opportunity to expand on our knowledge of metastatic disease drivers and derive prognostic signatures associated with poor survival.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Uveal melanoma,Metastasis,Imaging,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sanjana Srinivasan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Johnathon Rose<sup>1<\/sup>, Joseph  R.

The cytosine deaminase APOBEC proteins are major drivers of mutagenesis in human cancer, with over 70% of tumors exhibiting a mutational signature that is impacted by APOBEC activity. Nevertheless, the mechanisms through which tumor cells hijack the powerful APOBEC mutagenesis machinery to promote heterogeneity and therapy resistance remain largely unknown. Through a multi-disciplinary approach integrating bulk and single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq), whole-genome exome-sequencing (WES), and CRISPR library screening, we identified a long sought-after cell-intrinsic mechanism that prevents APOBEC-driven mutagenesis in non-malignant cells. The loss of this &#8220;molecular brake&#8221;, unleashes APOBEC3B-driven mutagenesis in malignant cells, which then becomes a key mutator and represents the long sought-after molecular source of driver mutations in some frequently mutated genes in cancers, including FOXA1, EP300, and AR. Functional screening identified eight crucial drivers for Androgen Receptor (AR)-targeted therapy resistance in prostate cancer that are mutated by APOBEC3B: BRD7, CBX8, EP300, FOXA1, HDAC5, HSF4, STAT3 and AR. Finally, contrary to conventional understanding, our study reveals that driver mutations in FOXA1 induced by APOBEC3B, not mutations in AR, evolutionarily outcompete other driver mutations and eventually dominate the resistant tumors. Collectively, these results uncover a cell-intrinsic mechanism that unleashes APOBEC-driven mutagenesis, which plays a significant role in conferring targeted therapy resistance and could be the potential therapeutic targets to overcome resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Resistance,Androgen independence,Heterogeneity,Mutations,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ping Mu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Xiaoling Li<sup><\/sup>, Yunguan Wang<sup><\/sup>, Tao Wang<sup><\/sup>, Su Deng<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"335cfbb3-eae1-4441-845b-7e6bc85ab1b5","ControlNumber":"6700","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

Additionally, tumors typically present with mutually exclusive mutations in one of three proteins with little functional overlap: BAP1, SF3B1, or EIF1AX. Metastatic progression of late-stage uveal melanoma is highly associated with chromosome 3 copy-loss, a unique chromosomal event (monosomy 3 or M3). However, the underlying biology of this distinct copy-loss event, and whether this event directly contributes towards the metastatic phenotype observed in late-stage disease, has largely been unexplored partially due to a lack of available models in the field. Here, using CRISPR-based centromere targeting we artificially created multiple isogenic clones exhibiting monosomy 3 (M3) from a well characterized disomy 3 (D3) UM cell model. Remarkably, the selective loss of one copy of chromosome 3 was sufficient to recapitulate clinical hallmarks of metastatic UM, including pigmentation loss, alterations in cell morphology and expression of late-stage disease markers. In addition, we also show how chromosome 3 copy-loss increases invasive potential and site-specific liver metastasis upon orthotopic implantation. Furthermore, successful development of this isogenic system has allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the molecular signaling, transcriptomic changes and chromatin-level modifications directly regulated by chromosome 3 copy-loss. Specifically, the monosomy 3 event emerged as the major contributor towards the molecular variance across D3 vs. M3 UM contexts and the primary driving force underpinning the large-scale epigenomic rewiring observed in M3 isogenic clones via transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATACseq). These observations together supported a scenario where the epigenomic rewiring associated to a selective genomic alteration, in this case the loss of one copy of chromosome 3, directs the acquisition of a new and aggressive phenotype. Current studies are focused on defining how these epigenomic alterations contribute towards the metastatic phenotype and identifying context-specific vulnerabilities associated with chromosome 3 copy-loss to develop novel therapeutics strategies to treat late-stage metastatic disease.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Uveal melanoma,Modeling,Metastasis,Epigenomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Johnathon  L.

We and others have investigated whole transcriptome profiles of bulk PM samples, identifying a molecular gradient with features of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which is related to, but not redundant with, histology. To date bulk studies of heterogeneity across PM tumors have not explained how biphasic tumors contain sarcomatoid (mesenchymal) and epithelioid (epithelial) components. We hypothesized that sarcomatoid and epithelioid components arose from distinct tumor clones. We performed integrated bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing and pathologic analyses of 93 samples from 39 patients&#8217; surgical resections including 3 negative-control pleura cases with non-PM pathology. Single-cell sequencing analysis was performed using the Seq-Well S<sup>3<\/sup> platform. Tumor clones were identified using inferCNV in R. Copy number and somatic variants were identified in adjacent bulk samples of each PM case with optical genome mapping and exome sequencing, respectively. We generated libraries from 19 epithelioid, 3 sarcomatoid, and 13 biphasic cases resulting in an average of 6,657 single cells per case (n=266,262 total cells; UMIs &#8805; 300 &#38; features &#8805; 80). Among the 32,383 high quality malignant cells, we characterized epithelioid and sarcomatoid programs independent of non-malignant cells in the microenvironment. We observed malignant cells expressing both programs at low levels, termed uncommitted. Uncommitted cells were not outliers in terms of UMIs detected, genes expressed, or mitochondrial transcript content, and were detected in 96.4% of PM cases with at least 50 high quality tumor cells. Most (72.7%) uncommitted cells were isolated from biphasic tumors. Additionally, we observed that individual tumor clones from biphasic tumors exhibited all three cell phenotypes. In one biphasic tumor, five of six clones comprised cells from all three types, where these clones were well-represented across multiple sites with epithelioid content ranging from 10% to 40%. In conclusion, our integrated analysis of multi-site pleural mesothelioma samples suggests that a single tumor clone may be capable of generating all molecular subtypes. Further work aims to identify candidate drivers of this plasticity, to relate single-cell transcriptomic phenotype to histology and to further characterize uncommitted cells.

From a pathological point of view, these tumors are composed of high-grade undifferentiated tumor cells (DD), often showing an abrupt transition from a compartment of well-differentiated adipocytic tumor cells (WD). Tumor cells from both WD and DD compartments are characterized by recurrent <i>MDM2<\/i> amplification, but their cellular origin and the molecular mechanisms associated with dedifferentiation are poorly understood.<br \/>Methods: We performed an integrated molecular analysis of tumors collected from 11 patients undergoing surgery for primary untreated DDLPS. DDLPS tumors were analyzed by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and bulk RNA sequencing on paired WD and DD samples from the same tumors. Results were validated <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> in an additional cohort of human tumors, patient-derived xenografts and DDLPS cell lines.<br \/>Results: Through RNA-sequencing of 102,753 individual cells from 11 primary DDLPS lesions, major cell clusters were identified based on unsupervised clustering of gene expression profiles and canonical markers. They include 31 tumor microenvironment clusters and 11 tumor cell clusters. A cluster of tumor cells from the WD compartment is characterized by signatures of early adipocytic progenitors, previously identified as TGF&#946;-dependent, DPP4-positive stromal progenitors. We show that these cells harbor specifically the truncal genomic alterations of the cancer, with further subclonal mutations identifiable in both WD and DD compartments of DDLPS. Furthermore, these cells have multipotent properties and their differentiation towards the adipocytic lineage is inhibited by TGF&#946;. Treatment of DD tumor cells with TGF&#946; inhibitors restores their adipocytic phenotype <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>.<br \/>Conclusion: We provide the first single-cell atlas of human DDLPS tumor and microenvironment and identify a population of adipocytic tumor progenitors at the origin of both WD and DD compartments.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is not only a genetically diverse disease but also has high transcriptomic heterogeneity (RNA-ITH). The RNA-ITH limits the reproducibility of expression-based prognostic models, which is poorly understood.<br \/>Methods: To address the issue, we investigated the effect of RNA-ITH on prognosis at both gene and signature levels using multiregional RNA-seq data from 45 NSCLC patients (145 regions) in the TRACERx study. We also performed multiregional RNA-seq of 25 NSCLC tumors (64 regions) for independent validation.<br \/>Results: At the gene level, we found that the maximal expression of hazardous genes (Hazard Ration (HR) &#62; 1) and the minimal expression of protective (HR &#60; 1) genes across different regions within a tumor are more prognostic than their average expression. As for prognostic signatures, we first designed five different functions to transform the multiregional expression of signature genes into patient-level values. To calculate individual risk scores, we applied them to assist two existing prognostic gene signatures, ORACLE (Outcome Risk Associated Clonal Lung Expression) and WTGS (whole-transcriptomic gene signature). As a result, the best performance was achieved using the combination of maximal hazardous signature expressions and minimal protective signature expressions. We next developed a new signature called PACEG (Prognosis-Associated Clonally Expressed Genes) and proposed a multiregional assay for higher prognostic accuracy in NSCLC. We demonstrated significant improvement in PACEG performance by leveraging RNA-ITH captured by multiregional expression of signature genes. Finally, we utilized the same strategy to study the impact of tumor immune microenvironment ITH on patient prognosis. Consistently, the minimal\/maximal infiltration of protective\/hazardous immune cells across tumor regions was the best measurement associated with prognosis in NSCLC. These results were independently validated by our local datasets.<br \/>Conclusions: The prognosis of NSCLC patients is often driven by the most aggressive tumor subclones. Our study proposed a novel strategy to incorporate RNA-ITH with expression-based prognostic models. Multiple distinct tumor regions should be considered to overcome the ITH issue for better prognostic evaluation, e.g., using the minimal\/maximal expression of protective\/hazardous signature genes across all regions to calculate the risk score in individuals. We also developed the PACEG panel composed of 26 genes that could be potentially applied in clinical specimens to identify high-risk NSCLC patients who may benefit from intensified adjuvant therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Intratumoral heterogeneity,Prognostic models,Multiregional RNA-seq,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Chenyang Li<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Thinh  T.

Therapeutic approaches to overcome acquired resistance are hindered by limited treatment options and the presence of multiple parallel resistance mechanisms. Rather than treating resistance after it emerges, it may possible to prevent it by inhibiting the adaptive processes which initiate resistance. However, these processes and the genes which control them are poorly understood. Here we report that drug-tolerant cancer persister cells, which constitute residual disease and seed relapse, undergo drug stress-induced sublethal apoptotic signaling resulting in activation of apoptotic DNase DFFB without cell death. DFFB induces DNA damage and mutagenesis in persister cells, revealing DFFB as a key regulator of stress-induced mutagenesis in persister cells. Furthermore, we found in multiple tumor types that DFFB is required for acquired resistance to targeted therapies. Mechanistically, DFFB induces multiple putative resistance mutations and may also promote epigenetic changes which result in resistance. These results reveal DFFB as a promising potential therapeutic target to prevent acquired resistance. In addition, this stress-sensing mutagenic mechanism may promote mutagenesis in other contexts including normal tissues because sublethal apoptotic signaling may result from a variety of physiological stresses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Mutagenesis,Resistance,Apoptosis,DNA damage,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>August Finley Williams<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, David Gervasio<sup>1<\/sup>, Claire Turkal<sup>1<\/sup>, Anna Stuhlfire<sup>1<\/sup>, Michael Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Brandon Mauch<sup>1<\/sup>, Ariel West<sup>1<\/sup>, Michelle Paw<sup>1<\/sup>, Mehrshad Hairani<sup>1<\/sup>, Cooper Lathrop<sup>1<\/sup>, Sophie Harris<sup>1<\/sup>, Jennifer Page<sup>2<\/sup>, Matthew Hangauer<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Cell and Genome Engineering Core, UC San Francisco, San Francisco, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0483f8cc-35d2-4f0f-b3eb-649c8bda6534","ControlNumber":"1428","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

ICC leads to a dismal outcome as the commonly used chemotherapy exhibit purely palliative effects on ICC, enabling only a limited improvement in survival until today. As ICC harbors few actionable target genes with inter-tumor genomic heterogeneity, ICC is considered to be one of the most intractable malignancies of all. Therefore, we implemented the multi-omics analysis especially with comprehension of the oncogenic metabolic changes to confer new treatment strategies. This study aims to unravel the evolution of ICC and identify ICC-specific metabolic pathways and essential targets for eradicating ICC.<br \/>Approach: We collected 12 primary ICC cases and 77 specimens and conducted a multi-omics approach, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics for each material.<br \/>Results: We demonstrated that intra-tumoral heterogeneity of ICCs with distinct driver genes per case indicates a &#8220;neutral evolution manner&#8221;, regardless of their tumor stage. Upregulation of BCAT1 and BCAT2 might enrich the &#8216;branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), such as Val, Leu, and Ile degradation pathway&#8217;. ICCs cases with the accumulated ubiquitous metabolites, BCAA exhibited poorer prognosis than those cases without BCAA accumulation significantly.<br \/>Conclusions: Regardless of the inter-tumor heterogeneity in genomic aberrations among ICC cases, we discovered the ubiquitous enrichment of the BCAA metabolic pathway in each tumor.

CIN is characterized by ongoing chromosome missegregation, generating copy number heterogeneity that provides a substrate for natural selection. Although CIN has been well studied in model systems, the evolutionary dynamics and genomic impact of CIN is underexplored in primary tumors and metastases. Newly developed single cell genomics assays allow for the measurement of the whole genomes of single cells obtained from patient tissues, thus providing a direct view into the evolution of tumor genomes undergoing CIN. To study the single-cell and spatial variation of chromosomally unstable tumors, we performed multi-region analysis of 128 tumor samples in a cohort of 45 patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), an archetype of high CIN cancers. We performed single-cell whole genome sequencing (scWGS) and profiled a total of 70,644 single cells from 63 pre-treatment samples obtained across 43 patients. For each patient, we computed total and allele specific copy number per cell, and inferred the evolutionary history of each tumor, including clonal and subclonal whole genome doubling (WGD) events and cell-specific whole chromosome or arm level copy number changes, indicative of missegregations. To determine whether missegregated chromosomes fail to become part of the primary nucleus (PN) upon mitotic exit and become enclosed in a micronucleus (MN), we used high-resolution cGAS immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy to profile site-matched FFPE tissues and quantify spatially-resolved rates of MN formation and rupture across 128 site-matched samples. A majority of tumors were characterized by early clonal WGD (61%, 22\/36 cases). The remaining patients exhibited subclonal WGD subpopulations averaging 10% of the patient&#8217;s cells in total. To understand the interplay between recent WGD and CIN across the cohort, we subset all patients cells into non-WGD, subclonal WGD, and clonal WGD and computed missegregation rates for these subsets. Non-WGD cells showed the lowest levels of missegregation. Subclonal WGD exhibited the highest rates of missegregation indicative of CIN following a recent WGD event. Clonal WGD exhibited intermediate levels of missegregation indicative of stabilization following a historical WGD event. CIN following WGD often resulted in a reduction in ploidy relative to the ancestral WGD cell. Using IF, we quantified the frequent breakdown of the MN membrane, and estimated spatially-resolved CIN rates by tracking localization of cGAS to the MN, which revealed elevated rates of MN formation and rupture. Through multimodal single cell measurements of HGSOC tumors, we were able to characterize genomic complexity from individual cell division errors in HGSOC, and shed light into how the transient processes governing ovarian cancer cell evolution impact the genomes of cell populations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Genomic instability,Cancer genomics,Clonal evolution,Ovarian cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ignacio Vazquez-Garcia<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Florian Uhlitz<sup><\/sup>, Marc  J.

Except from the genetic origin of cellular plasticity, cancer cells can transit to reversible phenotypic states as a result of microenvironmental cues and are often driven by stochastic epigenetic and\/or transcriptional fluctuations. Melanoma is a prime example of heterogeneous and plastic tumors where the origin and magnitude of cell state diversity remains poorly understood. Combining lineage tracing, 3D imaging and quantitative mathematical modelling in a clinically-relevant mouse model of melanoma, we demonstrated that tumors follow a hierarchical model of growth supported by a population of Melanoma Stem-like Cells (MSCs) that exhibit a transcriptomic signature of pre-migratory neural crest cells established transiently during embryonic development. ScRNA seq in mouse and drug na&#239;ve human biopsies revealed that MSCs are evolutionarily conserved and independent of the &#8220;genetic makeup&#8221; of the tumors. By deploying spatial transcriptomic approaches and multiplex imaging, we developed a <i>spatially and temporally resolved map<\/i> of the diversity of melanoma showing a non-random tumor organization. Multimodal analysis unraveled unique cell type and state interactions and importantly demonstrated that MSCs reside in perivascular niches favoring tumor growth. Endothelial Cells were found to have a key role in the acquisition of stemness properties. Co-culture assays led to melanoma dedifferentiation and proliferation advantage. Of note, supplementing melanoma cells with ECs accelerated the growth of tumors <i>in vivo<\/i>, where MSCs pool was increased. Consistent with a model in which only a fraction of cells are fated to fuel growth, temporal single-cell tracing of a population of melanoma cells harboring a mesenchymal-like state revealed that these cells do not contribute to primary tumor growth but, instead, constitutes a pool of metastatic-initiating cells that switch cell identity while disseminating to secondary organs. Taken together, these results will pave the way for the development of strategies that exploit the &#8220;chameleonic&#8221; nature of cancer cells and, ultimately, target MSC niche-dependent specification mechanisms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Heterogeneity,Hierarchy-perivascular niches,metastasis initiating cells,spatial organization,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Panagiotis Karras<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ignacio Bordeu<sup>2<\/sup>, Joanna Pozniak<sup>1<\/sup>, Ada Nowosad<sup>1<\/sup>, Cecilia Pazzi<sup>1<\/sup>, Nina Van Raemdonck<sup>1<\/sup>, Jia Hui Khoo<sup>3<\/sup>, Dennis Pedri<sup>1<\/sup>, Anil Rustgi<sup>4<\/sup>, Oliver Bechter<sup>5<\/sup>, Cedric Blanpain<sup>6<\/sup>, Benjamin Simons<sup>7<\/sup>, Florian Rambow<sup>8<\/sup>, Jean Christophe Marine<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>VIB-KU Leuven Center for Cancer Biology, Leuven, Belgium,<sup>2<\/sup>The Wellcome Trust\/CRUK Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom,<sup>3<\/sup>BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China,<sup>4<\/sup>Herbert Irving Comprehensive Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of General Medical Oncology, UZ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium,<sup>6<\/sup>Free University of Brussels (ULB), Brussels, Belgium,<sup>7<\/sup>The Wellcome Trust\/CRUK Gurdon Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom,<sup>8<\/sup>Institute of Applied Computational Cancer Research, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2551a955-c257-4c60-a8ae-c7426f88da8b","ControlNumber":"1768","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

The analysis of cancer genomes has identified APOBEC3A (A3A) cytidine deaminase activity as a cause of somatic mutagenesis in over 20 tumor types. In particular, A3A mutational signatures are found in a large proportion of ovarian tumors, ranging from 2-26% depending on subtype. Furthermore, genomic analyses of ovarian tumors suggest that A3A mutagenesis occurred during early metastatic progression, indicating the potential for A3A activity to promote clonal evolution. In non-ovarian tumors, A3A activity is associated with metastatic progression through the identification of A3A mutational patterns enriched in or unique to metastatic sites. Therefore, we hypothesized that aberrant A3A activity on OC genomes would increase mutagenesis, promote clonal diversity, and enable tumor progression. To examine the impact of aberrant A3A activity during OC progression, we developed a model system of inducible A3A expression in OC cell lines. We treated cells for 45 days with doxycycline to induce A3A expression (long-term, LT-A3A) and generated three biological replicates by treating individual wells of the parental lines independently. A3A is known to mutate the genome stochastically. Despite this, all versions of LT-A3A cells exhibited similar phenotypes compared to non-treated isogenic controls (NT). LT-A3A cells demonstrated increased colony formation relative to NT cells, indicating improved cell survival. We assessed cellular migration by scratch-wound assays and found that LT-A3A cells exhibited accelerated wound closure rates compared to NT controls, despite similar proliferation rates. In addition, cellular invasion was assessed by spheroid Matrigel invasion assays in which the invasive distance was significantly greater in LT-A3A cells relative to NT controls. By generating cell lines with a catalytically inactive doxycycline-inducible A3A transgene, we determined that the observed A3A-mediated cellular phenotypes were deaminase-dependent. To assess the molecular alterations driving these phenotypic differences, we performed RNA-seq on LT-A3A and NT cell lines. Gene set enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes identified significant overlap between the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and WNT\/Beta Catenin, Hedgehog, and TGF&#946; signaling gene sets. These related signaling pathways converge on the promotion of metastasis and cancer progression. These data suggest that aberrant A3A activity promotes the survival, migration, and invasion of OC cells by altering intracellular signaling pathways that promote EMT. Our ongoing experimental investigation will assess how long-term A3A mutagenesis impacts genomic heterogeneity and how A3A affects tumor behavior in animal models.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastatic potential,DNA damage,Tumor evolution,Tumor progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jessica Merritt Devenport<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mary Mullen<sup>2<\/sup>, Katherine Fuh<sup>3<\/sup>, Abby Green<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO,<sup>2<\/sup>Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO,<sup>3<\/sup>University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7e563a81-97cd-4614-840e-d97b083b611c","ControlNumber":"1411","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

We hypothesize that genes with low cell-to-cell transcriptional variability are more effective therapeutic targets, and use of variability as a metric will identify new metastatic regulators. Using single cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that the metastasis suppressor Raf Kinase Inhibitory Protein (RKIP\/ PEBP1) reduced overall transcriptional heterogeneity in TNBC xenograft tumors including oxidative phosphorylation genes. Consistent with a dependence on respiratory genes, metformin inhibited growth of RKIP-expressing but not RKIP-deficient tumors. Among genes with reduced transcriptional variability and increased mean in response to RKIP, we identified KMT5C as a novel epigenetic metastasis suppressor in TNBC. Taken together, these results indicate that analysis of gene expression variability along with mean can lead to effective target selection and provides an alternative strategy for identifying novel regulators of metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Heterogeneity,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Single cell,Metastasis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dongbo Yang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Christopher Dann<sup>1<\/sup>, Andrea Valdespino<sup>1<\/sup>, Lydia Robinson-Mailman<sup>1<\/sup>, Mengjie Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Gábor Balázsi<sup>3<\/sup>, Sebastian Pott<sup>4<\/sup>, Marsha Rich Rosner<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Ben May Department for Cancer Research, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Biomedical Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Human Genetics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5c03c45c-a4bb-4cdd-adfa-6a496b225f57","ControlNumber":"3893","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

We and other groups have identified mutation-harboring neural stem cells (NSCs) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) as cells-of-origin carrying driver mutations (Lee et al, Nature 2018). However, little is known about the evolutional process by which mutation-harboring NSCs in the SVZ transform into distant cancer cells with a high degree of molecular heterogeneity. Here, using a spontaneous, somatic mouse model that recapitulates human GBM arising from NSCs that carry driver mutations, we show that mutation-harboring NSCs transform into precancerous cells through oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) lineage specification during tumor evolution. These precancerous cells show dysregulated translation and\/or modification of extracellular matrix (ECM) prior to tumor formation. They subsequently give rise to GBMs with intratumoral heterogeneity exhibiting multiple developmental cell states as in human GBM, and also show activation of additional transcriptional programs, including immune evasion, ECM remodeling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and proliferation. Importantly, we further identified precancerous cell populations carrying driver mutations, namely gain of chromosome 7 and loss of chromosome 10 in tumor-free SVZ tissues from GBM patients with intratumoral heterogeneity. These human precancerous cells indeed exhibited OPC and neural progenitor cell-like expression patterns similar to those in our spontaneous GBM mouse model. Thus, our results demonstrate that cell-type specification of precancerous cells with oncogenic transcriptional programs underlie evolution of GBM from mutation-harboring NSCs and intratumoral heterogeneity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Intratumoral heterogeneity,Tumor evolution,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jeong Ho Lee<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hyun Jung Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Seok-Gu Kang<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology \/ Sovargen, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"81779785-f515-4c50-a02c-8e22145bc6b4","ControlNumber":"4072","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

EML4-ALK is the most common oncogenic fusion in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), accounting for approximately 5% of NSCLC patients. Different from other oncogenic drivers, e.g., EGFR or KRAS mutants, the ALK-rearranged tumors often show strong phenotypic plasticity and unique clinicopathologic features. Previous studies show that certain ALK-rearranged LUAD express the squamous biomarker p63 besides the adenomatous biomarker TTF1. Several studies also show that ALK-rearrangement is observed in certain lung tumors with mixed adenosquamous pathology, and quite rare in LUSC. Moreover, histological transformation such as adeno-to-squamous transdifferentiation (AST) are also observed in the relapsed ALK-rearranged LUAD patients failed from molecular targeted therapy. These clinical observations implicate a potential link between the oncogenic ALK fusions, and cancer plasticity, and even drug resistance. We established two lung cancer mouse models with wildtype EML4-ALK or L1196M mutant. H&#38;E and IHC staining were conducted to pathologically define the LUAD and lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) of mouse LUAD, LUSC and human ALK-rearranged LUAD were conducted to uncover the intratumorally heterogeneity and identify the cell subpopulations with squamous signature. Organoid culture system was established for AST process recapitulation and mechanism studies. Drug treatment in vitro and in vivo were conducted to study the TKI responses of LUAD and LUSC samples. Through analyses of RNA-seq and paired WGS data from 93 lung adenosquamous carcinoma specimens, we identified ALK-rearrangements were detectable at 7.5%. We then employ the EML4-ALK GEMM and find that transgenic expression of EML4-ALK fusion drives LUAD formation initially and squamous transformation at late stage, which mirrors the AST process in human ALK-rearranged lung adenosquamous carcinoma. We identify club cells as the main cell-of-origin for squamous transformation. Through recapitulating such lineage transition in organoids system, we identify the JAK-STAT signaling, activated by EML4-ALK phase separation, significantly promotes squamous transformation. Integrative study with scRNA-seq and immunostaining identify a plastic cell subpopulation in ALK-rearranged human LUAD showing squamous biomarker expression. Moreover, those also relapsed ALK-rearranged LUAD show notable upregulation of squamous biomarkers. Consistently, mouse squamous tumors or LUAD with squamous signature display certain resistance to ALK inhibitor, which can be overcome by combined JAK1\/2 inhibitor treatment. Our study not only uncovers the link between EML4-ALK fusions and cancer plasticity as well as TKI resistance, but also provides a potentially effective therapeutic strategy. &#60;!--EndFragment--&#62;","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,EML4-ALK,Adeno-to-squamous transdifferentiation,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zhen Qin<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Hongbin Ji<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"941c9644-e97d-459d-91ea-ebb3a95f96ba","ControlNumber":"4364","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Z.

Organoids are highly heterogeneous and include 2 major subtypes. Type-1 organoids are relatively homogeneous and develop via traditional mitosis, whereas type-2 organoids are highly heterogenous and are composed of differently sized polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs). Tracking the origin of PGCCs in type-2 organoids shows single cells first undergo asymmetric mitosis and nuclear fusion, followed by endoreplication, multipolar restitution mitosis, multipolar endomitosis, and karyokinesis. At the cellular level, the formation of PGCCs was associated with the formation of transient intracellular cells, termed fecundity cells. The fecundity cells underwent decellularization via the dissolution of the cell membrane, which allowed a giant nucleus to form via nuclear fusion. Different PGCCs underwent nuclear budding, decellularization, or entosis to form Russian doll-like tissue structures that facilitated rapid tumor growth and evolution. The uncoupling of nuclear augmentation from cytokinesis led to a rapid increase in the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio and increased the genomic content of PGCCs, which facilitated macro-genomic evolution during tumor development. Our live-cell imaging evidence allows us to link nuclear replication and cancer evolution to the nuclear morphologies observed by pathologists under the microscope. PGCCs may be the central regulators of malignant histogenesis, cancer evolution, and physical barriers conferring resistance to immune therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Heterogeneity,Cancer progression,Phenotype,Histopathology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Xiaoran Li<sup><\/sup>, Yanping Zhong<sup><\/sup>, Xudong Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Anil Sood<sup><\/sup>, <b>Jinsong Liu<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"336064e4-d99e-4264-8db6-0d787b589e40","ControlNumber":"5109","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>X.

However, for patients with resistance to front-line ICB, especially those with <i>BRAF<\/i><sup>WT<\/sup> tumors who received combination therapy, subsequent therapeutic options remain limited. Thus, understanding how ICB alters the tumor ecosystem, and thereby may create new vulnerabilities, is key to understanding effective therapies for ICB-experienced patients. Here, enabled through innovations in biospecimen research, we performed multi-modal single-cell RNA, T-cell receptor and single-cell spatial transcriptomics, coupled with whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 42 melanoma patient biopsies. This cohort includes 7 patients with paired before- and on-\/post-treatment biopsies, and spanned treatment-na&#239;ve metastatic cutaneous melanoma patients (n=10), on-ICB (aPD-1, n=7; aCTLA-4, n=1; combination therapy, n=2; total, n=10), and post-ICB (aPD-1, n=10; aCTLA-4, n=5; combination therapy, n=6; L19IL2+L16TNF, n=1; total, n=22). This cohort further includes 6 rare samples of mucosal melanoma (oral, n=4; rectal, n=2). In total, we profiled &#62;320,000 transcriptomes, including &#62;240,000 malignant and ~80,000 non-malignant cells, and 14,714 matched TCRs. We used a series of novel analytical approaches, including KINOMO to mitigate biases introduced by differences in gene dosage, and novel artificial intelligence frameworks, to discover differentially expressed genes and gene programs associated with treatment exposures and treatment sites. Compared to untreated specimens, there is an increase in antigen presentation (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, <i>P<\/i>=0) and reduction in lineage expression (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, <i>P<\/i>=0) in ICB-experienced tumors. Furthermore, mucosal melanomas harbor unique gene regulatory networks characterized by expression of immune evasive programs (e.g. SOX4; MAST, <i>P<\/i>=0) and exhibit lower expression of oxidative phosphorylation (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, <i>P<\/i>=0). Together, these data indicate a high degree of cellular adaption and plasticity. Through integration of single-cell, spatial and WGS, we further identify cancer clones defined by their aneuploidy patterns that confer geographically restricted immune evasion with a distinctly cold tumor microenvironment (TME), despite global T cell activation and clonal expansion. This suggest significant intralesional heterogeneity with respect to response to ICB, which may be explained by cancer cell-intrinsic factors rather than insufficient T cell responses to ICB. This work provides initial insights into spatio-temporal changes induced by ICB in cancer cells and the TME in a relatively large patient cohort. Our results indicate that functional and spatial variability exists in these tumors and may provide avenues for novel therapeutic development in ICB-experienced patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Single cell,Melanoma\/skin cancers,Tumor evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jana Biermann<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yiping Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Linyue Fan<sup>2<\/sup>, Patricia Ho<sup>1<\/sup>, Amit  D.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) poses a particular challenge as an aggressive and heterogeneous disease lacking the benefit of hormonal therapies. We have utilized a novel genetic lineage-tracking system, ClonMapper in TNBC cells to elucidate the pre-existent and <i>de novo<\/i> cell states that arise from chemotherapeutic intervention.<br \/>ClonMapper genetic tags were stably integrated into MDA-MB-231 cells using lentiviral transduction and positively labeled cells were isolated with fluorescence-activated cell sorting to generate a starting library of ~500 uniquely barcoded cells. Barcode-labeled MDA-MB-231 were selected with doxorubicin at 250, 400 and 550 nM for 48 hours and allowed to recover. To determine the contribution of transcriptomic state to cellular drug response we carried out single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) on 4 populations: a pretreatment cell library, an intermediary taken 30 h into drug selection, and two recovered populations from the 250 nM group. Importantly, we are able to capture and deconvolve ClonMapper lineage tags from scRNA-seq results and overlay them with transcriptomic state.<br \/>Following treatment with doxorubicin we found a dose-dependent reduction in the number of unique lineages, with all replicates showing &#62;6-fold decrease. Post-treatment replicates were each significantly comprised (90%) by fewer than three individual lineages. Lineage-resolved transcriptomics revealed two distinct lineage-specific subpopulations within the pretreatment cell library. These subpopulations demonstrated unique survivorship trajectories, beginning 30 h into selection and remaining well-separated following recovery from treatment. Comparing these subpopulations directly we observe enrichment for several pathways with markers genes remaining highly expressed post-treatment. Crucially, both subpopulations harbor a unique set of lineages which are found to survive treatment. However, in the absence of treatment we find that one subpopulation displays a faster growth rate and is likely to outcompete the other in culture conditions. The more proliferative subpopulation is marked by enrichment of Myc targets, compared with enrichment of glycolysis and KRAS signaling in the less proliferative subpopulation. This data demonstrates that subclonal heterogeneity inherent within this TNBC cell model, drives differential cell responses to chemotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-01 Causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Heterogeneity,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),Single cell RNA sequencing,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Daylin Morgan<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Amy Brock<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>The University of Texas At Austin, Austin, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5f6e466b-7d9b-46c1-81e2-b46a26c8e071","ControlNumber":"4861","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

Until now, much of the knowledge regarding FLAC is from case reports or small case series and there was no comprehensive multi-omics study of FLAC.<br \/>Methods: A total of 20 FLAC patients who underwent tumor resection were retrospectively recruited in this study. Three regions from each of the 20 tumor specimens and matched normal tissue specimens were collected. Whole-exome sequencing, targeted bisulfite sequencing and whole transcriptome sequencing were performed on multi-regional tumor samples and normal tissue samples.<br \/>Results: We compared our FLAC cohort with a conventional East Asian-ancestry lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and revealed lower frequencies of altered driver genes on both somatic mutations and CNV levels, including EGFR, KRAS and ERRB2, in FLAC. Mutational signature analysis showed an enrichment of age-related mutational signatures in FLAC and tobacco-associated and defective DNA mismatch repair-related signatures were more enriched in H-FLAC and in L-FLAC, respectively. Significant differences between H-FLAC and L-FLAC were observed in the genomic and epigenomic landscape. In contrast, the transcriptomic landscape of H-FLAC closely dissembled L-FLAC by pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes. Furthermore, although genetic and epigenetic changes showed congruent evolutionary trajectories, the relationships between multi-level intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) were distinct in H-FLAC and L-FLAC. The genetic and transcriptional ITH showed a significant negative correlation in H-FLAC but a significant positive correlation in L-FLAC. Moreover, the lower genetic ITH was significantly related to a worse recurrence-free survival and overall survival in FLAC patients whereas lower methylation ITH H-FLAC patients tended to have better survival.<br \/>Conclusions: In this study, we first depicted the multi-omics landscapes of this rare lung cancer type and compared the two subtypes in a multi-omics and heterogeneity aspect. Different levels of ITH showed different relationships with survival, and non-genetic ITH, instead of genetic ITH, may contribute to the prognosis in FLAC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiomics,Heterogeneity,Fetal adenocarcinoma of the lung,Molecular profiling,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Wei Guo<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Li Sun<sup>2<\/sup>, Xiaoxi Chen<sup>3<\/sup>, Haitao Zhou<sup>4<\/sup>, Shi Yan<sup>4<\/sup>, Gang Zhao<sup>5<\/sup>, Haimeng Tang<sup>3<\/sup>, Hua Bao<sup>3<\/sup>, Xue Wu<sup>3<\/sup>, Yang Shao<sup>3<\/sup>, Lin Lin<sup>6<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Thoracic Surgery, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Pathology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Geneseeq Research Institute, Nanjing Geneseeq Technology Inc, Nanjing, China,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Thoracic SurgeryHaitao, Peking University Cancer Hospital and Institute, Beijing, China,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Pathology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China,<sup>6<\/sup>Department of Medical Oncology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0648da7d-7d75-45d0-a4eb-25188de649e7","ControlNumber":"1481","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>W.

While most if not all single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies of lung cancer provided details on immune and stromal states, little insight is drawn to epithelial cells given their paucity (~4%) when performing unbiased scRNA-seq analysis without prior enrichment. Here, we performed in-depth scRNA-seq of enriched (by sorting for EPCAM+) epithelial cell subsets from 16 early-stage LUADs and 47 matching normal lung (NL) tissues. We also studied tissues from the same LUADs and adjacent NL by whole exome sequencing and a subset by high-resolution spatial protein and transcriptome analysis. We also performed scRNA-seq analysis of murine lungs from a human-relevant model of LUAD development following exposure to tobacco carcinogen, including strains with an alveolar type II (AT2) cell-specific lineage reporter. After extensive quality control, we retained 246,102 high quality human epithelial cells which comprised diverse normal alveolar and airway lineages as well as cancer cell populations. Diversity among cancer cells was strongly linked to LUAD oncogenic drivers. <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutant cancer cells were unique in their transcriptional features, strikingly reduced differentiation, low levels of copy number changes, and increased variability amongst the cells themselves. The local epithelial niche of LUADs, relative to that of NL, was enriched with intermediary cells in lung alveolar differentiation. A subset of these cells displayed elevated <i>KRT8<\/i> expression (<i>KRT8<sup>+<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>alveolar cells; KACs), increased plasticity and frequency of <i>KRAS<sup>G12D<\/sup><\/i><sup> <\/sup>mutations, and its gene expression profiles were enriched in lung precancer and LUAD and signified poor survival.<b> <\/b>Notably, KACs harboring <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations were only found in the ecosystem of <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutant LUADs. Murine KACs were evident in lungs of tobacco carcinogen-exposed mice that develop <i>KRAS<\/i>-mutant LUADs but not in the saline-treated control group. While murine KACs emerged prior to tumor onset, they persisted for months after carcinogen cessation, and like their human counterparts, acquired driver <i>Kras<\/i> mutations, were poorly differentiated, and harbored <i>KRAS-<\/i>specific<i> <\/i>transcriptional programs. Spatial transcriptomics analysis showed that KAC and KRAS signatures were elevated in both murine and human tumors as well as in KACs that were in the local spatial vicinity of the LUADs. Organoids derived from lungs of tumor-bearing reporter mice were markedly enriched with KACs and were conspicuously sensitive to targeted inhibition of KRAS-G12D. This study provides new insights into the landscape of normal epithelial and malignant cells in LUAD, the role of alveolar intermediate subsets in development of the malignancy, particularly that driven by mutant <i>KRAS<\/i>, and, thus, potential targets for early interception.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,KRAS,Lung adenocarcinoma,Cells of origin for lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Guangchun Han<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ansam Sinjab<sup>1<\/sup>, Warapen Treekitkarnmongkol<sup>1<\/sup>, Zahraa Rahal<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuejiang Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Alejandra G.

Resistance to these therapies thus represents a major barrier to effectively treating patients with NSCLC. Tumor heterogeneity has been identified as an important factor that may mediate ICI resistance, and prior analyses of NSCLC tumors have accordingly shown that greater tumor heterogeneity is correlated with diminished response to ICIs. However, the exact mechanisms of heterogeneity-mediated resistance remain unclear, and there exist a lack of models for studying the impact of tumor heterogeneity on therapeutic efficacy in NSCLC. To address this issue, we have developed a novel murine model of NSCLC that incorporates a system of clonal cell lines to precisely modulate tumor heterogeneity. Specifically, we isolated single tumor cells from a murine NSCLC cell line harboring 3 common driver mutations (<i>Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>Tp53<sup>+\/-<\/sup>Lkb1<sup>-\/-<\/sup>,<\/i> or &#8220;KPL&#8221;). We additionally isolated single cells after mutagenizing the KPL line with the alkylating agent N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, in order to obtain clones that better reflect the higher tumor mutation burden often seen in NSCLC. Clonal cell lines were derived from these single cells and then analyzed using whole exome sequencing to verify clonality and characterize their mutational profile. Phylogenetic analysis of mutations yielded categorization of these clones into 5 clusters. Clones within the same cluster demonstrated comparable in vivo growth kinetics and similar response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Combinations of these clones can be used to recapitulate various levels of heterogeneity and to form tumors with differing responses to PD-1 inhibition. Our results validate this system of clonal cell lines as a model of NSCLC that can modify multiple aspects of tumor heterogeneity and thus provide insights into the effects of tumor heterogeneity on ICIs and other immunotherapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-04 Methods to measure tumor evolution and heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Heterogeneity,Lung cancer: non-small cell,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Michael  S.
