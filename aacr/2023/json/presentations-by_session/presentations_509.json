[{"Abstract":"In situ techniques enable studying cells and tissues within their cellular context. This is of great importance in cancer, often displaying genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity with distinct subclones harboring different capacity to grow and spread. It was recently shown that by spatially mapping dozens of mutations within tumor tissues, tumor evolution and microenvironmental impact could be studied at the subclonal level (1). We have developed an in situ technique that spatially maps multiple expressed mutations simultaneously at subcellular resolution. The technique is based on single-nucleotide discriminating probes hybridized to mRNA. Correctly hybridized probes get ligated, amplified by rolling circle amplification, and decoded on our Xenium In situ platform. The technique was validated in well characterized cell lines, targeting multiple single nucleotide variants of the KRAS codons 12 and 13. As a proof of concept, we then applied the technique on FFPE breast tumor tissue sections that were previously characterized by targeted NGS onco-gene panels on extracted tumor DNA. In addition to the 280 plex Xenium Human Breast Gene Expression Panel, we targeted several mutations in situ and successfully mapped their spatial distribution in the tumor tissue sections. In summary, we demonstrate that the Xenium In Situ technology can spatially resolve the genetic and phenotypic landscape of breast tumors. The technology will enable researchers to unravel tumor evolution, growth and spread as well as the microenvironmental impact in detail, potentially refining patient stratification and treatment decisions.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-04 Methods to measure tumor evolution and heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Molecular imaging,Breast cancer,Mutations,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jessica Östlin<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Debashish Chitnis<sup><\/sup>, Mimmi Olofsson<sup><\/sup>, Iván Hernández-Neuta<sup><\/sup>, Malte Kuhnemund<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>10X Genomics, Stockholm, Sweden","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9e125322-f5f4-4d64-9fe7-218e706bfadb","ControlNumber":"2500","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

Chromosome-level aneuploidies are known to arise through errors in cytokinesis, but many of the mechanisms which drive large-scale ploidy alterations such as whole genome doubling (WGD) are still under investigation. WGD and subsequent ploidy reduction has been implicated as a key event in cancer evolution across patient samples. Further, in vitro studies have suggested that cells may undergo polyploidization to survive certain chemotherapies. Here, we apply lineage tracing technologies to test the hypotheses that some cells are primed to undergo WGD through endocycling or cell-cell fusion and that active polyploidization is a mechanism to resist chemotherapy. To deconvolve WGD by endocycling from WGD by cell-cell fusion, we transduced the TNBC cell line HCC1806 to create parallel populations with transcribed DNA barcodes on H2B-GFP or H2B-mCherry. All experiments were performed with homotypic cocultures containing equal proportion of cells from each fluorescent barcode population. With this method, ploidy alterations due to endoreplication were identifiable as monofluorescent single-barcoded cells with increased ploidy, while ploidy changes due to fusion were identifiable as double positive (GFP+mCherry+) double-barcoded cells with increased ploidy. The cell population was treated with an LD75 dose of doxorubicin and parallel plates were monitored by live-cell imaging. At each timepoint (pre-treatment, then 3, 5, and 14 days post-treatment), triplicate plates were stained with Hoechst and sorted into two fractions for lysis and DNA extraction: Near diploid (~2N) and ii) Hyperploid (&#62; 4N). Barcode composition of cells from each fraction and each timepoint was determined through Illumina sequencing of barcode amplicons. Here, we will present preliminary results revealing the subclonal dynamics of gross ploidy alterations through normal culture conditions and chemotherapeutic perturbation. This study will elucidate whether pre-existing or de novo polyploidy promotes cell survival during chemotherapy, and determine if gross ploidy alterations occur randomly or through deterministic selection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Copy number,Chemotherapy response,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC),,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Andrea L.

However, the context specificity and mechanisms by which APOBEC3 enzymes promote cancer initiation and progression require further elucidation. Lentiviral overexpression of APOBEC3C and an editase deficient APOBEC3C mutant in healthy cord blood, bone marrow and MPN patient hematopoietic stem\/progenitor cells (HSPCs) allows us to study the effects of innate immune deaminase dysregulation in the hematopoietic niche. We are focusing on the upregulation of APOBEC3C and adenosine deaminase acting on RNA1 (ADAR1), as we have previously shown them to be contemporaneously upregulated in the high-risk myelofibrosis (MF) stem cell population compared to normal aged bone marrow. We can compare these novel differential gene expression changes, RNA hyper-editing sites, and DNA mutation signatures induced by APOBEC3 mutagenesis to abnormalities seen in both hematopoietic malignancies and solid tumor cancers. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) performed on this dataset has exposed numerous deregulated pathways brought on by exaggerated levels of APOBEC3, including changes in splicing pathways. To further investigate the complex relationship between splicing and deaminase deregulation, we treated myeloproliferative neoplasm patient samples and normal HPSCs with Rebecsinib (also known as 17S-FD-895), a pharmacologically stable, potent, and selective small molecule splicing modulator, which interestingly caused significant downregulation of APOBEC3C. We will continue to investigate these findings as a potential target to correct the dysregulation seen in MPN progression. Consequently, we aim to use these findings to identify predictive biomarkers and druggable targets of leukemic initiation progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer stem cells,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jane Marie Isquith<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Jessica Pham<sup><\/sup>, Thomas Whisenant<sup><\/sup>, Larisa Balaian<sup><\/sup>, Catriona Jamieson<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UC San Diego School of Medicine, San Diego, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"93ddb5c2-d144-4ddf-a818-2f5d74ef2aee","ControlNumber":"2948","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

A main contributor to this gap in knowledge arises from technical challenges with genomic profiling of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) materials. To address this challenge, we developed Arc-well, the first high-throughput method that can perform single cell DNA sequencing of thousands of cells from FFPE materials and frozen tissues. Using Arc-well, we profiled genomic copy number in 27,851 single cells from 26 archival FFPE tissues that were stored for 3-31 years. Analysis of genomic evolution in 10 patients with matched DCIS and recurrent cancers (DCIS or IBC) separated by 2-16 years showed that many primary DCIS lesions had already undergone whole-genome-doubling and had extensive clonal diversity, similar to the paired recurrence. The data from most patients (8\/10) suggest an evolutionary bottleneck model of progression, in which a single subclone persisted during the progression to the recurrent disease, revealing copy number aberrations associated with invasion and recurrence.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-04 Methods to measure tumor evolution and heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Single cell,DCIS,Sequencing,Tumor heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Kaile Wang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Tapsi Kumar<sup>1<\/sup>, Junke wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Darlan Minussi<sup>1<\/sup>, Emi Sei<sup>1<\/sup>, Jianzhuo li<sup>1<\/sup>, Tuan Tran<sup>1<\/sup>, Aatish Thennavan<sup>1<\/sup>, Min Hu<sup>1<\/sup>, Anna Casasent<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhenna Xiao<sup>1<\/sup>, Shanshan Bai<sup>1<\/sup>, Yuehui Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, Amado Zurita<sup>1<\/sup>, Ana Aparicio<sup>1<\/sup>, Brian Chapin<sup>1<\/sup>, Jie ye<sup>1<\/sup>, Jianjun Zhang<sup>1<\/sup>, Don Gibbons<sup>1<\/sup>, Andrew Futreal<sup>1<\/sup>, Lorraine King<sup>2<\/sup>, Jeffrey Marks<sup>2<\/sup>, E.

Evolutionary techniques, such as phylogenetic analysis and the thoughtful calculation of selection intensities, are well suited to offer guiding insights in describing and, ultimately, overcoming therapeutic resistance.<br \/>Here, we quantify the relative importance of mutations occurring during EGFR targeted therapy on a cohort of Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients using clinical records to calibrate phylogenetic chronograms to identify variants occurring on branches of the tumor phylogeny coinciding with targeted EGFR therapy and calculate the evolutionarily-derived cancer effect size for those variants. We then compare these results to other cancer contexts to reveal the strikingly high effect size of the EGFR T790M mutation. To probe and quantify the constraints therapeutically driven selection pressure places on the cohort, we predict the neoantigen composition for each patient for both extant and ancestral tumor states, using a general allele frequency selection model to calculate selection on cancer variants constituting putative neoantigens. We then compare the proportion of negatively and positively selected neoantigens to non-neoantigen variants within the tumor to deduce if neoantigens are subject to additional immune scrutiny in a background of therapeutics. Lastly, we perform ancestral state reconstruction and mutational signature analysis to provide further insight on mutational processes on both individual patient and cohort levels, detailing how these endogenous and exogenous processes shift between etiologically pertinent time-points. Taken together, our results detail the degree of selection on cancer undergoing targeted therapy and highlights unique shifts in mutational processes in response to such therapies, ultimately offering quantitative insights that can inform clinical decision making regarding therapeutic strategies in Lung Adenocarcinoma and provide a framework for analyzing similar cancer systems.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,Resistance,Evolution,Neoantigens,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>J Nicholas Fisk<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Stephen Gaffney<sup>2<\/sup>, Katerina Politi<sup>3<\/sup>, Scott Gettinger<sup>4<\/sup>, Fernando de Miguel<sup>3<\/sup>, Jeffrey Townsend<sup>5<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Yale University, New Haven, CT,<sup>2<\/sup>Biostatistics, Yale University, New Haven, CT,<sup>3<\/sup>Pathology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT,<sup>4<\/sup>Medical Oncology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT,<sup>5<\/sup>Biostatistics, Yale University School of Public Health, New Haven, CT","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0d4463d3-d49a-48b6-992d-64637682093d","ControlNumber":"3840","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Since changes in methylation status of a CpG site may be retained in mitosis, they could be used to infer the progression history of a tumor via single-cell lineage tree reconstruction. In this work, we introduce the first principled distance-based computational method, Sgootr, for inferring a tumor's single-cell methylation lineage tree and jointly identifying lineage-informative CpG sites which harbor changes in methylation status that are retained along the lineage. We apply Sgootr on the single-cell bisulfite-treated whole genome sequencing data of multiregionally-sampled tumor cells from 9 metastatic colorectal cancer patients made available by Bian et al., as well as multiregionally-sampled single-cell reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing data from a glioblastoma patient made available by Chaligne et al. We demonstrate that the tumor lineages constructed reveal a simple model underlying colorectal tumor progression and metastatic seeding. A comparison of Sgootr against alternative approaches shows that Sgootr can construct lineage trees with fewer migration events and more in concordance with the sequential-progression model of tumor evolution, in time a fraction of that used in prior studies. Interestingly, lineage-informative CpG sites identified by Sgootr are in inter-CpG island (CGI) regions, as opposed to CGI's, which have been the main regions of interest in genomic methylation-related analyses.

To address these issues, we performed multisampling of the endometrium with extensive spatial mapping.<br \/>Methods: We collected multiple endometrial glands from normal endometrium in a 5mm lattice in 19 patients who underwent hysterectomy (3-31 samples per case), followed by DNA extraction, detected somatic mutations by whole exome sequencing, to identify large clones that spread across samples based on shared mutations.<br \/>Results: In total, 216 bulk endometrial glands were analyzed. The number of detected somatic mutations per sample ranged from 6 to 98 (mean&#177;SD: 37.8&#177;16.0), and most of the samples had at least one known driver gene mutation (mean&#177;SD: 4.38&#177;2.27). The mutational signature analysis revealed the predominance of the age-related SBS1 and SBS5 signatures. dN\/dS analysis identified 21 genes that were positively selected in normal endometrium, including <i>PIK3CA, PIK3R1, KRAS, PPP2R1A, ARHGAP35,<\/i> and <i>FBXW7<\/i>, most of which are also known as driver genes for endometrial cancer. The number of mutations and their frequency for each driver gene did not differ by background diseases: endometriosis, endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer and other non-endometrial related diseases. We found clones showing a large expansion involving multiple samples in 8 cases, most of which harbored one or more driver mutations, such as <i>PIK3CA<\/i> and <i>KRAS<\/i>. The size of the largest clone carrying a <i>KRAS<\/i> mutation, which was found in a 32-year-old woman with cervical cancer, spanned as long as 10 mm in diameter. This suggests that clonal expansion in the endometrium could be very rapid even in healthy women, which contrasts to the observations that clonal expansion in other organs is usually seen in aged individuals.<br \/>Conclusion: We confirmed the high frequency of driver mutations in the normal endometrium, most of which overlapped to those found in endometrial cancers, suggesting that these driver genes are involved in the early phase of the development in the endometrial cancer. Some of the driver-mutated clones expanded in macroscopic size. Our findings provide an interesting insight into the clonal structure and underlying genetic variation in the normal endometrium.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Clonal evolution,Endometrial cancer,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Koichi Watanabe<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nobuyuki Kakiuchi<sup>2<\/sup>, Shiro Takamatsu<sup>3<\/sup>, Sachiko Kitamura<sup>3<\/sup>, Mana Taki<sup>3<\/sup>, Koji Yamanoi<sup>3<\/sup>, Ryusuke Murakami<sup>3<\/sup>, Ken Yamaguchi<sup>3<\/sup>, Junzo Hamanishi<sup>3<\/sup>, Hiroko Tanaka<sup>4<\/sup>, Satoru Miyano<sup>4<\/sup>, Masaki Mandai<sup>3<\/sup>, Seishi Ogawa<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>The Hakubi Center for Advanced Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>4<\/sup>M&D Data Science Center, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b4522409-e4be-43e1-b66b-6e847235c5f3","ControlNumber":"3524","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

Due to their histological similarity, it is still a clinical challenge to distinguish between double primary cancer (DPC) and metastasis cancer (MC) in synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancers in which the latter represents a poor prognostic outcome. Clinically, the standard procedure for examining DPC and MC relies on their morphology and histopathology; however, showing poor accuracy even under explicating criteria. Here, we attempt to utilize indel variants within polyguanine (polyG) sequences to generate genetic distances of synchronous endometrial and ovarian tumors to normal tissue in a patient and then calculate the correlation coefficient for them. Polyguanine sequences are hypermutable guanine repeats that acquire insertion or deletion at a high incident rate (mutation rate: ~10<sup>-6<\/sup> - 10<sup>-4<\/sup>; ~1000 folds higher than unique sequence) and, therefore, could serve as a very rich resource for comparing the genetic similarity between samples. The correlation between selected clinical variables, e.g., disease-free survival and the described correlation coefficient is then calculated to test whether this protocol can serve as an optimal tool for distinguishing between DPC and MC. We have assembled a cohort of 39 patients with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancers in which pathologists cannot determine the relationship between endometrial and ovarian cancer in 23 of them. Preliminarily, we have collected DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens and completed polyG genotyping for four of them. Indel variants, both insertions and deletions, are rich in all cases indicating the approach is technically rigid for this purpose even with FFPE specimens. Subsequently, we evaluate the similarity between endometrial and ovarian cancer by calculating Spearman's correlation with the genetic distances obtained from polyG genotyping. As the result of preliminary cases, we observe the correlation coefficient spreading between -0.14 to 0.95, implying this methodology can determine the genetic similarity between endometrial and ovarian tumor in a case and, therefore, could be a potential tool to supplement the current observation-based approach in the clinic. Our next step is to correlate the correlation coefficients with meaningful clinical variables once we complete genotyping the entire cohort. We anticipate this approach could provide additional information to distinguish DPC and MC and therefore benefit the patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-04 Methods to measure tumor evolution and heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ovarian cancer,Endometrial cancer,Metastatic tumors,Heterogeneity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yu-Yi Huang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Pei-Chi Cheng<sup>2<\/sup>, Ching Hsu<sup>3<\/sup>, Yung-Ming Jeng<sup>4<\/sup>, Lin-Hung Wei<sup>5<\/sup>, Wei-Ting Hung<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Graduate Institute of Medical Genomics and Proteomics, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan,<sup>2<\/sup>Graduate Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, NTUH, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Pathology, National Taiwan University Hospital, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, NTUH, Department of Oncology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9d172b57-006f-4fe9-8473-717aff9c1e65","ControlNumber":"4019","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Here we sought to evaluate the genomic landscape of stage IA, low-volume, non-myometrial invasive ECs to define the earliest drivers and tumor evolution of endometrioid EC.<br \/>Methods: Early-stage, non-myoinvasive EC of patients who underwent surgery at our institution and were subjected to clinical tumor-normal targeted sequencing of up to 505 cancer-related genes. Tumor volume was determined based on the gross and histologic measurements, and the tumors were dichotomized into low- and high- volume disease using a cutoff of 1 cm<sup>3<\/sup>. Genomic data was extracted and cancer cell fractions (CCF) of the somatic mutations were determined using ABSOLUTE integrating the mutational variant allele frequency and copy number alterations.<br \/>Results: A total of 160 non-invasive, stage I ECs were identified, of which the majority (n=128; 80%) were FIGO grade 1 (15.6% grade 2, 3.1% grade 3). The median calculated volume of disease was 1.3 cm<sup>3<\/sup>, and 18 cases did not have gross disease with only microscopic disease identified on pathologic evaluation. The tumors on average had 6.7 somatic mutations affecting known EC cancer-related genes, including <i>PTEN<\/i> (n=127; 79%), <i>ARID1A<\/i> (n=84; 52.5%), <i>PIK3CA<\/i> (n=81; 50.6%), CTNNB1 (n=61; 38.1%), <i>PIK3R1<\/i> (n=59; 36.8%) and <i>KRAS<\/i> (n=48; 30%). None of the alterations showed a significant correlation with tumor volume. Analysis of the CCF revealed that in 43% of ECs (69\/160)[WB1] , <i>PTEN<\/i> mutations were clonal and had the highest CCF, indicating that <i>PTEN<\/i> mutation is most likely the initiating carcinogenic event. In other subsets of the early-stage ECs studied, the highest CCFs were mutations affecting <i>PIK3CA<\/i>\/<i>PIK3R1<\/i> (n=26), <i>ARID1A<\/i> (n=17), and <i>KRAS<\/i> (n=16). We also found that 109 (68%) ECs harbored activating mutations involving at least two genes in the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway, with the most common combination being <i>PTEN<\/i>\/<i>PIK3CA<\/i> or <i>PTEN<\/i>\/<i>PIK3R1<\/i>. <i>AKT1<\/i> mutations occurred in absence of other PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway alterations. Unsupervised Louvain clustering based on somatic mutations and gene copy number alterations revealed 5 distinct clusters of ECs with unique mutational drivers.<br \/>Conclusion: Stage IA non-myoinvasive ECs show considerable genomic heterogeneity suggestive of multiple evolutionary pathways. Further studies are warranted to define whether this heterogeneity is a sign of early genomic drift (i.e. neutral tumor evolution) or whether the various evolutionary pathways all confer similar selective advantages.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Endometrial cancer,Molecular profiling,Genomics,Clonal evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sara Moufarrij<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Carol Aghajanian<sup><\/sup>, Nadeem Abu Rustum<sup><\/sup>, Lora Ellenson<sup><\/sup>, Britta Weigelt<sup><\/sup>, Amir Momeni<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"86864a24-5612-46f9-8e34-9492cb8c01d2","ControlNumber":"2465","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic progressive disease of unknown etiology affecting the bile ducts and has been associated with a substantially increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma. Clonal dynamics in the normal bile duct and PSC epithelium remains poorly understood because of the limited accessibility to normal\/inflamed bile ducts. In this study, we established a method to detect somatic mutations accumulated in the bile duct epithelium and investigated a mutation rate in normal bile duct cells and clonal expansion in PSC epithelium.<b><\/b><br \/>Methods: We established single cell-derived organoids from bile, which were subjected to whole genome sequencing to measure the age-related mutation rate in normal epithelial cell in the bile ducts. We next collected multiple samples from perihilar bile ducts in patients with PSC who underwent total hepatectomy for liver transplantation, for which we performed whole exome sequencing to investigate clonal expansion in PSC-involved bile ducts.<br \/>Results: In total, 14 single cell-derived organoid lines were established from 2 patients with PSC and 3 control individuals. Based on the whole genome sequencing of those organoids, the number of mutations found in non-PSC bile duct epithelium increases with age at an annual mutation rate of 38.2 mutations per genome per year, which did not substantially differ from the rate in the PSC epithelium, suggesting that the inflammatory process in PSC hardly affected the mutations in PSC epithelium. To further investigate clonal expansion in the PSC epithelium, a total of 126 bulk organoid samples from perihilar bile ducts in 3 PSC patients were analyzed. Somatic mutations were detected in all samples (21 [4-101] \/ exome \/ sample on average), some of which showed high variant allele frequencies. In 2 PSC cases, a small number of somatic mutations (n=12[case 1], 11 and 8[case 2]) were shared between samples that were 13 mm distant apart from each other, suggesting a clonal expansion in PSC epithelium. Expanded clones harbored mutations in known cancer-driver genes, such as <i>ARID2<\/i> and <i>PIK3CA<\/i>, suggesting their role in the expansion in this case.<br \/>Conclusions: Here, we newly established the method to detect somatic mutations accumulated in the normal\/inflamed bile duct epithelium using an organoid-based analysis of clonal somatic mutations. Our results revealed clonal expansion existing in PSC epithelium and open up further potential for approaching carcinogenesis in the bile duct.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inflammation,Clonal evolution,Cholangiocarcinoma,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hirona Maeda<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nobuyuki Kakiuchi<sup>1<\/sup>, Takashi Ito<sup>2<\/sup>, Eri Ogawa<sup>3<\/sup>, Masahiro Shiokawa<sup>4<\/sup>, Norimitsu Uza<sup>4<\/sup>, Hiroko Tanaka<sup>5<\/sup>, Yasuhito Nannya<sup>6<\/sup>, Hideki Makishima<sup>1<\/sup>, Hiroaki Yasuda<sup>7<\/sup>, Yuzo Kodama<sup>8<\/sup>, Satoru Miyano<sup>5<\/sup>, Seishi Ogawa<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Tumor Biology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery and Transplantation Department, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Pediatric Surgery, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>5<\/sup>M&D Data Science Center, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>6<\/sup>Department of Hematology\/Oncology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>7<\/sup>Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan,<sup>8<\/sup>Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"87cb857d-9278-4f37-84c8-a3b38c22bf14","ControlNumber":"4004","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

Through selective breeding of animals with the slowest growing tumor at 11 days following implantation over ten generations, we evolved resistance to tumor growth in two contrasting strains of mice: severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) and immuno-competent C57BL\/6. We found that the two strains evolved different strategies of resistance to the cancer. In the immunocompromised mice, skin fibroblasts infiltrated into and around the tumor to impede growth, while an enhanced immune response to tumor antigens, slowed tumor growth in the immunocompetent mice. However, when the experiment was extended beyond 11 days, tumor growth rapidly increased so that, at 28 days, it was comparable in size to the control animals. We investigated the molecular-level mechanisms underlying these resistance traits in SCID mice. We identified transcriptomic changes using RNA-Seq in both skin and tumor samples to compare the evolved mice (EV) with the original strain (WT) at 11 days and 28 days. We used DESeq2 and two-way ANOVAs on the normalized data to identify significant differences in gene expression. We adjusted p-values for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery correction and used a q value of less than 0.1 (and\/or a greater than two-fold change) to determine the significance for differential expression levels. Comparing transcriptomic data from skin fibroblasts from evolved (EV) and non-evolved (WT) SCID mice at day 11 following implantation (i.e., the point of maximal tumor suppression) revealed 98 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). EV SCID fibroblasts showed increased expression of MicroRNAs, including MiR-7 and Mir5125, and acid metabolic pathways, such as Carbonic anhydrase III. A comparison of the tumor cells from day 11 and day 28 demonstrated substantial epigenetic evolution with 1353 DEGs. The tumor cells at day 28 adapted to the host response by increasing expression of genes for extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, mainly the metalloproteases gene family. Here we used selective breeding to allow evolution to reveal potential host strategies to suppress tumor growth. However, we find that, over time, tumor cells can evolve successful counter strategies to overcome host resistance. Our results provide novel insights into key dynamics of somatic evolution during carcinogenesis and highlight the critical roles of epigenetic modification and inheritance in these somatic eco-evolutionary dynamics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-03 Complex adaptive systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Evolution,arms race,resistance ,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Arig A.

Tumor phenotype was evaluated from pathology reports and longitudinal growth kinetics from diagnostic MRI data. Analysis of 889 tumor samples is complete and profiling of the full cohort will be presented at the 2023 AACR meeting.<br \/>Within clonally independent tumors, we performed two tests to assess for evidence of convergence between tumors from the same patient. First, we tested for parallel events in canonical ccRCC drivers. We found significant enrichment of somatic <i>VHL<\/i> variants occurring in one patient with a germline whole <i>VHL <\/i>gene deletion encompassing neighboring <i>BRK1. <\/i>Contiguous <i>BRK1<\/i> loss is associated with less aggressive ccRCC phenotype and our findings suggest a specific constraint in this patient. We next assessed for evidence of convergence by measuring the genetic distance of copy number and mutational profiles between and within patients with resampling and permutation. Similar somatic profiles between tumors were only detected in 1\/76 patients whose tumors were characterized by infrequent somatic alterations beyond 3p loss indicating little evidence of convergence.<br \/>Cystic ccRCCs represent an indolent phenotype not associated with metastasis that may progress to solid tumors over time; we found mixed tumors closely resemble somatic profiles of solid tumors whereas cysts were characterized by infrequent copy number gains and low chromosomal complexity. We also identified cysts with specific losses (chr16, chr17, chr19p) mutually exclusive with 3p LOH suggestive of VHL-loss independent cyst formation. In solid ccRCCs, we found chromosomal complexity and loss of specific chromosomal loci (9p and\/or 14q) are associated with diameter potentially reconciling the observation linking risk of metastasis to tumor diameter in VHL-related ccRCC.<br \/>In summary, within the constrained setting of VHL-related ccRCC, evolution is dominated by chance although specific patient and phenotype specific constraints are observed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Renal cell carcinoma,Sequencing,Heterogeneity,Hereditary cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Scott  T.

Due to its high frequency of lymph node spread, lymph node dissection has become a standard procedure in surgical treatment. A randomized trial showed that patients who underwent D2 lymphadenectomy had a better 5-year survival outcome than ones who had D1 dissection in advanced gastric cancer, implying the D2 lymph node might serve as an outpost before tumor cells spread to distant organs. This clinical observation raises a possibility that the regional lymphatic spread could be under strict selection but not a passive process.<br \/>Materials and Methods: To understand the evolutionary relationship between primary tumors, perigastric lymph nodes, and second tier of lymph nodes in the extra-perigastric area, we reconstruct their phylogeny using genetic variants in hypermutable DNA regions where the mutation rate is 10<sup>2<\/sup>~10<sup>4<\/sup>-fold than unique sequence. We have assembled a cohort of 10 gastric cancer patients, including intestinal-, diffuse- and mixed type GC. For each case, we collected all workable lymph node metastases and intensely sampled primary tumors. On average, we have over fifteen samples per case on the phylogenetic tree.<br \/>Results: Preliminary data of the first two patients show high heterogeneity within primary tumors as well as between different lesions of lymph nodes or peritoneal metastases in gastric cancer. Interestingly, in stark contrast to all other lymph node metastases which intermingle with primary tumors, a clade consisting of one proximal and one distal lymph node with a bootstrap value above 90% is observed in each phylogeny, and it is worth noting that samples on these clades are from intestinal type tumor.<br \/>Conclusion: Our results indicate that most tumor cells arrive both regional and distal lymph nodes passively via lymphatic drainage in GC while a selective process also exists which coincides with clinical observation. Whether the existence of tumor cells under a relatively stricter selection process would lead to different clinical outcomes is under investigation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastric cancer,Lymph node metastasis,Heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Pei-Chi Cheng<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Wei-Ting Hung<sup>2<\/sup>, Yung-Ming Jeng<sup>3<\/sup>, I-Rue Lai<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Graduate Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan,<sup>2<\/sup>Graduate Institute of Medical Genomics and Proteomics, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Pathology, National Taiwan University Hospital, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"32b3fd34-7f2f-417c-abfc-bc2f6d66b9e5","ControlNumber":"1529","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

However, among the thousands of mutations in pediatric cancer genes, accurate prediction of driver genes is one of the biggest challenges. A binary logistic regression model was developed to distinguish pediatric and non-pediatric cancer genes. To build the predictive model, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed, followed by the PANTHER overrepresentation test, using PANTHER GO-slim, PANTHER, Reactome pathways, and three sets of specific variables, the lists of pediatric cancer genes found in the germline, relapsed, and chemotherapy-resistant cells, respectively. This statistical model was pediatric cancer-specific, confirming known driver genes across cancers. In addition, mathematical models were developed using stochastic differential equation approaches and computational simulations to extend our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics during pediatric tumorigenesis. Moreover, our stochastic models in childhood cancers were validated by mutation accumulation experiments using <i>E. coli<\/i> strains carrying a mutation in replication restart genes.

Clones with long term tumor-initiating cell activity are thought to fuel colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis formation and recent reports suggest that drug tolerant persister cells are endowed with the ability to replenish the tumor during relapse upon therapy. To decipher gene expression heterogeneity of sub-populations within individual clones, we link gene expression states to clonal dynamics in metastatic and therapy resistant sub-populations. We transduced CRC patient-derived organoids with CloneTracker XP&#8482; library, which bears stable genetic barcodes expressed on the RNA level. 300,000 uniquely barcoded cells were either passaged with and without drugs treatment (5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and irinotecan) <i>in vitro<\/i> or serially transplanted orthotopically into immune deficient NSG mice. At determined endpoints, cells or xenograft tumors were harvested and analyzed for clonal dynamics and sub-clonal gene expression programs associated to tumor progression and therapy resistance, respectively using single cell RNA and barcode DNA sequencing.Integrated bioinfomatic analyses of scRNA data from more than 35,000 cells before, during and after recovery from <i>in vitro<\/i> drug treatment linked clonal barcodes to gene expression of individual cells. The clonal complexity score, i.e number of distinct clones\/number of cells, remained stable before and after treatment, suggesting that the clonal composition of the cell population was marginally affected by chemotherapy. After recovery, single cell gene expression data reflected that individual clones contain cells in distinct transcriptional states, with an elevated proportion expressing the intestinal stem-like program. In addition, single cell and bulk barcode analysis of transplanted xenografts revealed that the bulk of tumor and metastasis in liver and lung is formed by a subfraction of 0.006% of all transplanted clones, indicating a strong clonal selection. In serial transplantations of metastasis, only 4 to 5 clones constituted more than 90% of cancer cell bulk. Regarding gene expression in tumor, individual cell subpopulations within the same clone were distributed within 12 different gene expression clusters, which were maintained in metastasis. Overall, our results indicate that multiple clones contribute to both metastasis and therapy resistance and suggest that intra-tumoral heterogeneity is driven by modulation of subclonal gene expression programs. Here, we provide insights into subclonal gene expression heterogeneity and identify transcriptional states which may be potentially relevant for tumor progression and therapy resistance. This may provide the basis for the future development and testing of innovative novel treatment strategies directed against these cellular states.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Heterogeneity,Colorectal cancer,Metastasis,Drug resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>M Haidar Kasem<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Attila Jády<sup>2<\/sup>, Jan-Philipp Mallm<sup>1<\/sup>, Hanno Glimm<sup>2<\/sup>, Sebastian  M.

Although many drivers of acquired drug resistance have been identified, the underlying molecular mechanisms shaping tumor evolution during treatment are incompletely understood. We recently demonstrated that lung cancer targeted therapies commonly used in the clinic induce the expression of cytidine deaminase APOBEC3A (A3A), leading to sustained mutagenesis in drug tolerant cancer cells persisting during therapy. Preventing therapy-induced A3A mutagenesis by gene deletion decreased the accumulation of chromosomal aberrations and delayed the emergence of drug resistance. Thus, we hypothesize that inhibition of A3A may represent a potential therapeutic strategy to halt the evolution of resistant clones and prevent acquired resistance to lung cancer targeted therapies. Understanding the molecular mechanism of A3A induction during targeted therapy is a crucial step to develop targeting A3A therapies.Using a targeted drug combination screen, we found that DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors induce expression of APOBEC3A in non-small cell lung cancer cells, phenocopying the effects of targeted therapies. RNA-seq profiling revealed that both targeted therapies and DNMT inhibitors increase expression of non-coding repeat RNAs. Repeatome analysis identified distinct classes of non-codding RNAs including endogenous retrovirus elements (ERV) in drug tolerant persister cells. Activation of endogenous intracellular viral sensing pathways by exogenous nucleic acids mimicking viral infection induced APOBEC3A, and genetic perturbation of RIG-I or MAVS reduced APOBEC3A induced by targeted therapy. These findings suggest that epigenetic derepression of retroviral repeat elements may underly APOBEC3A mutagenic activity and tumor evolution during lung cancer targeted therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Tumor evolution,APOBEC,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hideko Isozaki<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ramin Sakhtemani<sup>1<\/sup>, Naveed Nikpour<sup>1<\/sup>, Susanna Monroe<sup>1<\/sup>, Jessica Lin<sup>1<\/sup>, Lecia Sequist<sup>1<\/sup>, Zofia Piotrowska<sup>1<\/sup>, Justin Gainor<sup>1<\/sup>, Rémi Buisson<sup>2<\/sup>, Michael Lawrence<sup>1<\/sup>, Aaron Hata<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"793fdccf-73a3-4fb3-b161-f992a2da96f1","ControlNumber":"5249","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

Understanding the molecular events that drive this evolution remains a high priority for understanding dynamic response to treatment. However, models that accurately map individual clones&#8217; activity and sensitivity to treatment remain a challenge. To fill this gap, we established monoclonal cell populations (MCP) from a cell line and used this model system to dissect coexisting cellular and molecular events within an individual tumor and modulated response to anti-EGFR treatment in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers (NSCLC).<br \/>Materials\/ Methods: MCPs were established from the commercially available H1975 EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell line. Parental cells were resuspended at a density of 10 cells per mL and 100 &#956;L of cell suspension was added to each well of a 96-well plate. Eight plates were used, and each well was inspected 24 hours post-seeding by two or more independent scientists. Wells with individual cells were monitored every 3-4 days and followed throughout the expansion process. Once MCPs were established, morphological comparison was performed using the opensource QPath software and clones were classified as circular, branched, or mixed. Selected clones were then treated with 0.7 &#956;M of Osimertinib for 72 hours, in line with the IC50 value of the parental line and treatment responses were compared.<br \/>Results: Of the 120 single cells detected, 25 expanded successfully and 16 were treated with Osimertinib. Rates of clonal expansion varied from 19 to 49 days and the most prominent morphology was branched (68.75%), followed by mixed (18.75%) and circular (12.5%). No direct correlation was observed between rate of expansion and cell morphology. Response to Osimertinib varied significantly across the clones compared to the parental line from which they were established. Cell viability after 72 hours of treatment with Osimertinib was similar between the parental line and 5 of the 25 clones. For the remaining clones, cell viability was significantly lower in the monoclonal cell subpopulations compared to the parental line. Specifically, cell viability decreased by 40% compared to the parental cell in 5 clones. In the most sensitive clones, cell viability was reduced by 63% and 75% compared to the parental.<br \/>Conclusion: 25 monoclonal cell subpopulations were successfully established and expanded from the H1975 cell line. MCPs showed significant variations in their growth rate and sensitivity to Osimertinib suggesting that this approach may help identify coexisting mechanisms of response to treatment within an individual tumor. Defining molecular profiles of coexisting MCPs may lead to the identification of biomarkers that may assist physicians in predicting response to treatment or design combination regimens that concomitantly target subclones within the tumor microecology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-04 Methods to measure tumor evolution and heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Heterogeneity,Lung cancer: non-small cell,EGFR TKI resistance,Response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Claire Blanchard<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kyle Avery<sup><\/sup>, Chelsea Ward<sup><\/sup>, Abduljalil M.

GBM remains uniformly lethal, with a median overall survival of 14-16 months, despite aggressive therapy. In people aged 65 and above, prognosis is even more dismal, with median survival of less than 7 months. While comorbidities explain some of the increased age-related risk, age-related changes in the tumor microenvironment likely also contribute. Aging brains have higher incidence of polyploidy (Pearson r=0.80; P=0.031; Nandakumar et al., 2021), hypoxia related gene expression (Pearson r =0.22, P =0.008) and Glucose levels (Ding et al., 2021) as well as decreased stiffness (Hiscox et al., 2018). The average ploidy of 20 different cancer types correlates with the Oxygen levels recorded in their respective tissue of origin (Spearman r = 0.66, P = 0.002). Together these results suggest that <i>availability of metabolic substrates in the<\/i><i> GBM<\/i><i> environment drives different cell fate decisions in cancer cells of different ploidy and shapes <\/i><i>GBM disease <\/i><i>initiation<\/i>.<br \/>We address this hypothesis with integrated in-vitro and in-silico experiments and multi-omic and imaging analysis of primary and recurrent GBM. We genetically engineered cell lines to obtain diploid and tetraploid lineages for each and tested how exposure to variable gradients of glucose, hypoxia and phosphate affect their migratory patterns. We performed RNA-seq and WGS of multiple regions obtained from two patient-matched primary and recurrent GBM. Pre- and post-surgery MRI data was available from both surgeries and registered to a T1 map Atlas to quantify stiffness and oxygenation in the brain. This data was used to calibrate a Stochastic State-Space Model (S3MB) we developed to recapitulate re-growth of enhancing primary tumor margins into the respective recurrent tumor. The model domain is initiated from MRI data and consists of 4mm<sup>3<\/sup><sup> <\/sup>voxels. Each voxel state is defined by 8+ variables that are updated over time: Stiffness, Oxygen, Phosphate, Glucose, Vasculature, Dead cells, migrating cells and proliferating cells of various ploidies.<br \/>In-vitro results, multi-omics results and similarity between observed and simulated recurrent tumors were used to infer model parameters (resource consumption-, migration-, death and proliferation rates). Running the model backwards in time, we predict the local point of origin (LPO) of each GBM. We found that resource availability in the predicted LPO was correlated to WGD status, suggesting conditions in the local environment in which a GBM originates shape the outcome of an early competition between diploid and tetraploid cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-03 Complex adaptive systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA copy number,Energy,Microenvironment,Glioblastoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Noemi Andor<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>H.

Multiclonality is not routinely incorporated at clinical evaluation, however, marker status as a pathological parameter holds great potential for improving prognostic accuracy. Here, we evaluated the frequency of multiclonality and whether ERG\/SPINK1 status is correlated to aggressive disease in whole-mount specimens.<br \/>For each of the 89 radical prostatectomy cases, one H&#38;E-stained whole-mount slide and a corresponding dual ERG\/SPINK1 IHC stained slide were collected. Aperio AT2 scanner (Leica Biosystems) digitized these slides into whole-slide images (WSIs). All WSIs were reviewed by a pathologist with the aid of an automatic Gleason grading software to identify each tumor focus and determine its Gleason grade group (GG), and the expression levels (% uptake) of ERG and SPINK1, respectively. Grade groups 4 and 5 were treated as one high-grade group (GG4-5). The associations among GG, ERG, and SPINK1 expression levels were analyzed.<br \/>For each WSI, 1 to 7 (median 2, mean 2.53) tumor foci were identified, and the aforementioned values were determined, resulting in 225 data records. The number of tumor foci, ERG\/SPINK1 expression statistics, and their association for each GG are shown in the table. ERG was expressed the most frequently in GG1, and its frequency decreased as the grade increased. Conversely, SPINK1 expression frequency increased with the grade group. The expression of ERG and SPINK1 was inversely correlated regardless of grade group. More detailed results on the exploratory data analysis and the association with BCR will be shared at the time of presentation.<br \/>ERG or SPINK1 expression do not appear to be associated with Gleason grade groups. More studies are needed to see if these markers may predict recurrence free survival or patient response to therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first study to map molecular subtypes in whole-mount samples utilizing a foci-based approach.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{57736D48-2886-4C4A-B27D-417EC82BD3D5}\"><caption><\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Grade group<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Total<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">ERG<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">SPINK1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\">ERG-SPINK1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">positive<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ratio (%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">positive<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ratio (%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">co-positive<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">co-negative<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">mutually exclusive<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">GG1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">74<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">38<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">51.4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">24<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">32.4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">16<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">54<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">GG2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">81<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">35<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">43.2<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">40<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">49.4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">7<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">61<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">GG3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">33<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">11<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">33.3<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">22<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">66.7<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">4<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">25<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">GG4-5<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">37<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">10<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">27.0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">13<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">35.1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">1<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">15<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">21<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Overall<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">225<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">94<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">41.8<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">99<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">44.0<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">16<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">48<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">161<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-04 Methods to measure tumor evolution and heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Tumor heterogeneity,Molecular subtypes,Immunohistochemistry,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Joonyoung Cho<\/b><sup><\/sup>, In Hye Suh<sup><\/sup>, HyeYoon Chang<sup><\/sup>, Tae-Yeong Kwak<sup><\/sup>, Sun Woo Kim<sup><\/sup>, Nallasivam Palanisamy<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Deep Bio Inc., Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"093a5b08-128f-4811-9c92-57244cb354c0","ControlNumber":"6369","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) provides cancers with significant adaptability, leading to metastatic progression and resistance to treatment, but its complexity often complicates its study. To understand how ITH contributes to ICB response, we derived 24 clonal sublines from single cells of an ICB-sensitive and genetically and phenotypically heterogenous mouse model of melanoma. Genomic and transcriptomic analyses uncovered the diversity of these sublines and their plasticity while <i>in vivo<\/i> studies demonstrated a wide range of responses to ICB therapy including resistant, partially sensitive, and fully responsive. Distinct responses to anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy compared to combination (anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-L1) therapy were also observed, and further exploration of untreated tumors revealed correlations between highly inflamed and differentiated phenotypes with response to anti-CTLA-4. To better understand changes in plasticity and immune profile throughout the course of treatment, tumors were harvested from the parental cell line prior to treatment and at several timepoints after treatment with anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy. These samples are undergoing high throughput spatial transcriptomics analysis to map the melanoma phenotypes characterized in the clonal sublines with changes in the immune compartment. Furthermore, blood samples were collected to investigate inflammatory profiles of cytokines and chemokines to describe the evolution of the tumor microenvironment throughout the course of immunotherapy. Further studies will allow us to identify predictive and prognostic biomarkers of resistance and relapse upon ICB therapy, respectively. Overall, the 24 clonal sublines serve as a valuable tool to model tumor dynamics associated with ICB efficacy and understand the complex role melanoma plasticity plays in immune evasion mechanisms.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-02 Clonal evolution,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Intratumoral heterogeneity,Clonal evolution,Immune checkpoint blockade,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Isabella Church<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Charli Gruen<sup>1<\/sup>, Antonella Sassano<sup>1<\/sup>, Julio Valencia<sup>2<\/sup>, Emily Wu<sup>1<\/sup>, Howard Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Gabe Needle<sup>1<\/sup>, Cari Smith<sup>3<\/sup>, Sung Chin<sup>3<\/sup>, Jessica Ebersole<sup>3<\/sup>, Christina Marcelus<sup>1<\/sup>, Anyen Fon<sup>1<\/sup>, Huaitian Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Chi-Ping Day<sup>1<\/sup>, Howard Young<sup>2<\/sup>, Maxwell Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Glenn Merlino<sup>1<\/sup>, Eva Pérez-Guijarro<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD,<sup>2<\/sup>Cancer Innovation Laboratory, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD,<sup>3<\/sup>Laboratory Animal Science Program, Leidos Biomedical Research Inc., Frederick, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"61dd33a9-b3df-4448-a7bd-7fabe3c0c2e6","ControlNumber":"5538","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>I.

While some prostate cancers appear &#8220;constrained&#8221; to a luminal epithelial lineage despite progression on androgen signaling inhibitors, others exhibit a &#8220;lineage-promiscuous&#8221; phenotype under the pressures of these therapies. However, a clinically applicable marker that quantifies lineage plasticity has yet to be developed. To address this knowledge gap, we applied single-cell genomics and bulk epigenetic profiling to two patient derived xenografts (PDXs) derived before and after chemotherapy from the castration-resistant prostate tumor of a 42-year-old with a PSA 486, Gleason 5+4, cT4N1M1b PCa, who succumbed to his disease within 21 months of diagnosis. We reasoned that the two PDXs, MDA PCa 177-B (AR negative, basal transcriptional profile) and MDA PCa 189-1 (AR positive, luminal transcriptional profile), should share the property of lineage plasticity and serve to define candidate measurable signatures of this property. Targeted and single-cell DNA sequencing showed that the two models share 66.8% of their annotated mutations, 71.5% of copy number variations, and a common ancestor in their phylogeny, confirming their common clonal origin. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed the presence of a cluster of cells shared by both PDXs that contained a highly mixed program, similar to a &#8220;high-plasticity cell state&#8221; (HPCS) previously implicated in the emergence and maintenance of cellular heterogeneity in genetically engineered mouse models of lung cancer (Marjanovic et al PMID: 32707077). H3K27ac, H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing performed in triplicates revealed chromatin profiles shared by both PDX models, and being absent from normal prostate specimens in publicly available datasets. In conclusion, our data supports the hypothesis that the property of lineage plasticity can be reflected in a biomarker signature and used as a measurable metric. Ongoing are evaluation of the candidate signatures in publicly available datasets representative of the spectrum of the disease in patient samples, and assessment of the effects of systemic therapies (including epigenetic modulators) on the property of lineage plasticity in clinical and co-clinical samples.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-04 Methods to measure tumor evolution and heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Heterogeneity,Transcription,Epigenetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Souzana Logotheti<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Haswanth Vundavilli<sup>2<\/sup>, Eugenia Papadaki<sup>3<\/sup>, Yuehui Zhao<sup>2<\/sup>, Marcos Roberto Estecio<sup>4<\/sup>, Rama Soundararajan<sup>5<\/sup>, Peter Shepherd<sup>1<\/sup>, Jiabin Dong<sup>1<\/sup>, Anh Hoang<sup>1<\/sup>, Shuai Guo<sup>2<\/sup>, Nora Navone<sup>1<\/sup>, Vasiliki Tzelepi<sup>6<\/sup>, Christopher Logothetis<sup>1<\/sup>, Yue Lu<sup>7<\/sup>, Aristidis Vrahatis<sup>3<\/sup>, Wenyi Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Ana Aparicio<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Genitourinary Medical Oncology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Informatics, Ionian University, Corfu, Greece,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, UT MD Anderson Cancer, Houston, TX,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX,<sup>6<\/sup>University of Patras, School of Medicine, Department of Pathology, Patras, Greece,<sup>7<\/sup>Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2cfb35f0-becd-4b83-9947-915ffe67252a","ControlNumber":"5880","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

While our understanding of resistance mechanisms continues to expand through preclinical and clinical sequencing efforts, comprehensive approaches to map the distribution of potential resistance mechanisms in a given cell line and drug context require the development of novel approaches.<br \/>Here, we describe the design of a platform for profiling cancer resistance at scale. Beginning with a single sensitive parental cancer cell line, the EGFR-mutant lung cancer line PC9, we optimize pre-existing diversity using a combination of single-cell subcloning and alkylator mutagenesis, and generate 50 independently evolved clones resistant to the EGFR inhibitor osimertinib. Profiling of this library via multiplexed whole genome sequencing (WGS) demonstrates convergent mutations in the MAPK pathway. Taking a similar approach, we profile the NTRK1-fusion-driven KM12 colon cancer cell line, yielding convergent, clinically observed, on-target resistance mutations to the NTRK inhibitor larotrectinib.<br \/>Taken together, these results provide an initial proof-of-concept for the high-throughput generation of viable drug-resistant cancer clones. Future efforts to increase mutational diversity as well as assess additional drug and disease contexts will broaden the utility of this approach.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-03 Complex adaptive systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Resistance,Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI),Whole genome sequencing,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Arvind Ravi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sainikhil Sontha<sup>2<\/sup>, Maisha Chowdhury<sup>2<\/sup>, Jacob Smigiel<sup>2<\/sup>, Matthew Rees<sup>2<\/sup>, Brian Danysh<sup>2<\/sup>, Jennifer Roth<sup>2<\/sup>, Laxmi Parida<sup>3<\/sup>, Eric Lander<sup>2<\/sup>, Gad Getz<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>DFCI\/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA,<sup>3<\/sup>IBM Research, Yorktown Heights, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"fee434e7-908d-4419-905d-9518996263d8","ControlNumber":"7792","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;A.

Recent studies show that the GBM tumor microenvironment (TME), composed of reactive glial cells, microglial subtypes, neuronal activity, myeloid cells, lymphocytes, etc., plays a crucial role in the invasiveness and evolution of the glioma cells. Nevertheless, how the spatial architecture and interplay among these cells facilitates GBM resurgence is largely unknown. To this point, we developed a pipeline for characterizing the TME changes using single nucleus and spatial transcriptomics (ST). We retrospectively collected matched, fresh-frozen, IDH-wildtype pGBM and rGBM samples (n=14, 7 patients) from the Mayo Clinic Neuroscience Biobank. Single nucleus RNA sequencing was performed using the 10x Chromium platform. Matched FFPE blocks from 8 samples were collected from the Mayo Clinic pathology department for 4 of the 7 patients. A region of interest was identified from the corresponding histopathology slide by a pathologist, avoiding areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. The region was collected from the block using a 5mm biopsy punch. The tissue was re-paraffinized, and a 5&#181;m thick section was used to perform ST with the 10x Visium for FFPE platform. We performed transcriptomic and image texture-based clustering of capture dots along with differential gene expression analysis. Based on gene expression, we identified and characterized conserved regions across samples. We used single nucleus data to infer cell composition. Spatial correlation and autocorrelation statistics were calculated on features, such as gene expression, gene set scores, cell type prediction, and antibody capture. The features&#8217; relative spatial changes were compared between pGBM and rGBM. Our analyses showed high heterogeneity within and across samples, but we found higher molecular and textural heterogeneity in rGBM samples compared to pGBM. We found higher androgen response activity (p &#60; 0.001) presents diffusely (I: 0.09) throughout rGBM tissue but localized to mesenchymal-like regions in pGBM (I: 0.15). KRAS signaling signature was decreased in pGBM (p &#60; 0.01) and increased in rGBM (p &#60; 0.01). This increase was significantly overexpressed in cluster 0 for rGBM (p=0.02), which is an area characterized by neural progenitor signature. No significant difference in KRAS or EGFR magnitude or distribution of expression was present for either GBM type, indicating an independent mechanism for pGBM. We established a pipeline for assessing the spatio-temporal changes of the GBM TME. We found evidence indicating differences in the type of growth signaling, the cells bing targeted, and their distribution across the TME between pGBM and rGBM. Our work suggests how ST can help us better understand the intricate dynamics of GBM.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-04 Methods to measure tumor evolution and heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Tumor heterogeneity,Recurrence,Glioblastoma multiforme,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jean  R.

However, despite its wide acceptance, this simple concept cannot explain cancers&#8217; numerous oncogenic driver mutations, structural genomic changes in normal and embryonic tissues, nuclear atypia, and lack of tissue differentiation. Due to these pitfalls, the cancer research community is searching for a new paradigm to explain the complexity of tumors and guide future research. Here I proposed a new hypothesis based on the observation of different tumors and their correlation with stages of early embryonic development in humans to explain human tumors' complexity and origin. I consider cancer a developmental disease of sexual or asexual origin. In tumors of sexual origin, the giant egg cell undergoes cleavage after fertilization to form blastomeres that generate genomic chaos via the rapidly increasing genomic contents of the zygote. The compacted embryo then forms a blastocyst, resulting in embryonic transformation and the formation of the trophectoderm. After implantation, the trophectoderm develops into a placenta, and the inner cell mass develops into a baby or a differentiated tumor resembling a specific embryonic tissue stage or fetal organ if one or more germ layers fail to complete differentiation. In tumors of asexual origin, the tumor starts with senescent somatic cells. Following environmental and genetic stresses, the senescent cells undergo escape via genomic duplication or multiplication, giving rise to polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs), the somatic equivalent of blastomeres. This leads to genome duplication or multiplication to create genomic chaos and the development of high-grade cancer with a high level of nuclear atypia, a process analogous to sexual-mediated pre-embryogenesis but without subsequent differentiation. This new hypothesis not only explains the different tumor entities and their benign and malignant natures but also provides a unified explanation of the chaotic genomics and somatic mutations of cancer during embryonic development. The evidence to support this hypothesis will be presented from the pathology, developmental, and genetic perspectives. The switch from conceiving cancer as a disease of mitosis-based cell proliferation to conceiving it as a disease arising from giant cell-mediated development provides a new paradigm to decode tumors' complexity, understand their origins at the organismal level, and guide future cancer research.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB10-03 Complex adaptive systems,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Malignant progression,Cancer initiating cells,Differentiation,Etiology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jinsong Liu<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"097285fa-e659-425e-a5ef-c8fdda71f828","ControlNumber":"2656","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.
