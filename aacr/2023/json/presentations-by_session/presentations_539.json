MpBCs are enriched for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)\/cancer stem cell (CSC) markers, produce high levels of nitric oxide (NO), and have a hyperactive phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. NO activates multiple oncogenic pathways, such as PI3K and transforming growth factor beta (TGF&#946;), a regulator of EMT. Therefore, we hypothesized that pan-NOS inhibitor NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (L-NMMA) could augment the efficacy of &#945;-specific PI3K inhibitor alpelisib in MpBC <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> models.<br \/>Immunostaining analysis revealed that MpBC PDX tumors had elevated co-expression of iNOS and pAkt (60% vs 23%, p=0.04) relative to triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) PDX tumors. MpBC PDX tumors had higher <i>RPL39 A14V<\/i> (66% vs 4.7%, p&#60; 0.00) and <i>PIK3CA<\/i> hotspot mutation rates (50% vs 19.1%, p=0.31) than TNBC PDX tumors. L-NMMA was synergistic with alpelisib in MpBC cell lines with <i>PIK3CA\/PIK3R1<\/i> mutations and antagonistic in <i>PIK3CA<\/i>-wild type and <i>PTEN<\/i>-deleted models. <i>In vivo<\/i> evaluation using MpBC PDX tumors found that L-NMMA augmented the efficacy of alpelisib in reducing tumor volume in <i>PIK3CA<\/i>-mutated MpBC PDX models. Transcriptomic analysis found gene sets associated with EMT reversal, such as the formation of cornified envelope (NES = 2.04 Nom p&#60;0.00) and keratinization pathway (NES = 2.06, Nom p&#60;0.00), were enriched pathways in MpBC PDX tumors that responded to combination therapy. Pharmacological\/genomic inhibition of iNOS reversed EMT in MpBC cells, by decreased expression of Zeb1, TGF&#946;, Snail, Vimentin, and increased expression of E-cadherin and ZO-1 in immunoblotting analysis. MpBC cells with NOS2 knockout acquired an epithelial-like cellular morphology, and this reversal of EMT rendered MpBC cells more sensitive to alpelisib and taxane-chemotherapy. MpBC PDX tumors that responded to combination therapy also exhibited a reversal in EMT, with a decrease in aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH1), a CSC marker. Combination therapy also reduced tumor-initiating ability, enhanced chemosensitivity, and improved overall survival in MpBC PDX models.<br \/>These studies paralleled a phase 1b\/2 clinical trial with L-NMMA+taxane chemotherapy in a cohort of anthracycline-refractory MpBC patients (NCT02834403). The clinical benefit rate was 40% (6\/15), overall response rate was 20% (3\/15), and one patient achieved a pathologic complete response. Relative to baseline tumors, the responder end-of-treatment tumors had undergone reversal of EMT, with decreased expression of iNOS and ALDH1.<br \/>We find that combining L-NMMA and alpelisib is a novel therapeutic strategy to treat MpBC, and combination therapy is being tested in a first multicenter phase 2 study for patients with MpBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-05 Novel targets and pathways,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,iNOS,PI3K,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tejaswini  P.

The pocket of KRAS is small and has a considerably smooth and shallow surface, resulting in difficulty for small molecule to bind to the protein. Recent accelerated approval of Sotorasib (AMG 510) by FDA marked the first marketed KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor for the treatment of 2<sup>nd<\/sup> line KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutation-positive NSCLC patients. Although great clinical benefits were delivered by this breakthrough medicine, intrinsic or acquired drug resistances were developed in a large portion of patients treated. HYP-2A is a new chemical entity (NCE) being developed by Sichuan Huiyu Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of KRAS<sup>G12C <\/sup>inhibitor resistant tumors. It is an orally bioavailable, potent KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor that shows very high anti-proliferation activities in NCI-H358 cell line and various Sotorasib and Adagrasib (MRTX 849) resistant tumor cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i> and demonstrates strong <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy in the corresponding xenograft mouse models. It inhibits NCI-H358, H358 AMGR, Mia PaCa-2, PaCa-2 AMGR, KYSE-410, and SW1573 cell lines with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values range from low double-digit to single-digit nanomolar. When dosing at 10 mpk via PO, HYP-2A demonstrates significant efficacy (TGI &#62; 75%) in SW1573 Xenograph mouse model, whereas neither Sotorasib nor Adagrasib shows any obvious efficacy at 30 mpk with TGIs less than 20% in the same experiment. Similarly, when dosing at 10 mpk via PO, HYP-2A exhibits strong efficacy (TGI &#62; 90%) in KYSE-410 Xenograph mouse model, while neither Sotorasib nor Adagrasib shows any significant efficacy (TGI &#60; 50%) at 30 mpk via PO dosing in the same experiment. In an acute toxicity study in rats, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of HYP-2A is found higher than 30 mpk. In a two-week toxicity studies in rodents, rats are found well tolerated when treated with HYP-2A via PO at 3-10mpk (QD) for 14 consecutive days. The MTD of HYP-2A is determined higher than 10 mpk. In this presentation, we will highlight the research program that leads to the discovery of HYP-2A, which is currently under IND-enabling studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"K-ras,Inhibitor,2nd-Generation G12C inhibitor,Drug resistant,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shoujun Chen<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Xiaoming Qiang<sup><\/sup>, Haibo Wang<sup><\/sup>, Yong Xiong<sup><\/sup>, Ke Liu<sup><\/sup>, Dengming Liao<sup><\/sup>, Nan Zhong<sup><\/sup>, Mingdeng Liu<sup><\/sup>, Xuemei Mu<sup><\/sup>, Rudan Huang<sup><\/sup>, Min Li<sup><\/sup>, Dengwei Gui<sup><\/sup>, Meilin Huang<sup><\/sup>, Yuting Chen<sup><\/sup>, Yuanfu Pan<sup><\/sup>, Wengang Yao<sup><\/sup>, Yingte Song<sup><\/sup>, Zhongbo Wang<sup><\/sup>, Wenbin Wang<sup><\/sup>, Jun Liu<sup><\/sup>, Xingchi Yu<sup><\/sup>, Zhen Liang<sup><\/sup>, Yike Yuan<sup><\/sup>, Zhao Ding<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Sichuan Huiyu Pharmaceutical Co.

MYC-driven cancers are known to be addicted to protein translation. This addiction creates a dependency on critical components of the translational machinery providing in turn a unique opportunity for therapeutic intervention. We hypothesized that targeting the translation termination factor GSPT1, a key regulator of protein synthesis, would constitute a vulnerability for MYC-driven tumors. Herein we further describe MRT-2359 a potent, selective and orally bioavailable degrader of GSPT1. MRT-2359 was rationally designed using our QuEEN<sup>TM<\/sup> discovery engine and optimized to achieve a profound and preferential antiproliferative activity in MYC-driven cell lines, such as high N- and L-MYC mRNA expressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) lines. In line with expectations, MRT-2359 activity is dependent on both CRBN and the GSPT1 G-loop degron. We further demonstrate using an inducible system that the sole expression of either N- or L-MYC is sufficient to sensitize initially resistant NSCLC cells to MRT-2359. These studies therefore establish a causal link between N- and L-MYC expression and sensitivity to MRT-2359. Unlike MRT-2359, agents targeting the protein translation initiation machinery or repressing MYC transcription (CDK9 inhibitor) failed to show such differential activity. Mechanistically, RiboSeq and polysome profiling revealed that treatment with MRT-2359 in the N- or L-MYC high cell lines induces ribosome stalling at the stop codon, increased monosomes and decreased polysomes. These changes are indicative of translational repression and were confirmed using puromycilation assays. Proteomics and RNAseq studies finally demonstrated a significant reduction in the total levels of N- or L-MYC leading in turn to the downmodulation of MYC target genes. Despite robust degradation of GSPT1, no marked effect was observed in these assays in low N- or L-MYC lines, confirming the selective activity of MRT-2359 in MYC-driven lung cancers. Last, the anti-tumor activity of MRT-2359 was assessed in &#62;80 lung patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). MRT-2359 demonstrated preferential activity in N- and L-MYC high NSCLC and SCLC PDXs, including numerous instances of tumor regressions, when dosed orally daily or intermittently. Similar levels of anti-tumor activity were also observed in neuroendocrine lung cancer and lymphoma PDXs. Together these results warrant further investigations in the clinic. Oral MRT-2359 is currently in a Phase 1\/2 clinical trial in selected cancer patients with MYC-driven NSCLC, SCLC, high grade neuroendocrine cancers and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (<i>NCT05546268)<\/i>.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"GSTP1,Myc,Lung cancer,Lymphoma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Gerald Gavory<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mahmoud Ghandi<sup>2<\/sup>, Anne-Cecile d’Alessandro<sup>1<\/sup>, Debora Bonenfant<sup>1<\/sup>, Maciej Cabanski<sup>1<\/sup>, Lisa Cantagallo<sup>2<\/sup>, Agustin Chicas<sup>2<\/sup>, Qian Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Anna Diesslin<sup>1<\/sup>, Christopher King<sup>2<\/sup>, Vittoria Massafra<sup>1<\/sup>, Rajiv Narayan<sup>2<\/sup>, Arnaud Osmont<sup>1<\/sup>, Dave Peck<sup>2<\/sup>, Carolina Perdomo Ortiz<sup>1<\/sup>, Martin Schillo<sup>1<\/sup>, Ambika Singh<sup>1<\/sup>, Ralph Tiedt<sup>1<\/sup>, Simone Tortoioli<sup>1<\/sup>, Silvia Buonamici<sup>2<\/sup>, Filip Janku<sup>2<\/sup>, Owen Wallace<sup>2<\/sup>, Bernhard Fasching<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Monte Rosa Therapeutics, Inc., Basel, Switzerland,<sup>2<\/sup>Monte Rosa Therapeutics, Inc., Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e374ddff-0a30-4426-b821-68f7f3ea4783","ControlNumber":"2810","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>G.

However, acquired resistance, which is the result of BTK C481S mutation, has been observed in patients. So reversible BTK inhibitors are developed to overcome acquired resistance of covalent BTK inhibitors. In order to achieve adequate efficacy, reversible BTK inhibitors require much higher exposure which may lead to higher risk of adverse effect. Proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) is a novel drug discovery strategy and achieve sustained target degradation though a catalytic mechanism of action. Comparing with traditional small molecule inhibitor, PROTAC has shown great advantages in overcoming acquired resistance, since potent and sustained active site occupation is no longer required. Here, we have identified a novel BTK-PROTAC HZ-Q1070 based on our DaTProD<sup>&#174;<\/sup> platform, which is set up to promote the druggability research of PROTAC. After a series of evaluations, HZ-Q1070 has been validated as a promising pre-clinical candidate for further clinical development.<br \/>Results: 1. HZ-Q1070 can effectively degrade BTK in cancer cell lines with DC<sub>50<\/sub> &#60; 0.05 nM. In vitro cancer cell growth inhibition assay, it completely suppressed the cell proliferation of a panel of lymphoma cell lines with IC<sub>50<\/sub> &#60; 0.05 nM, such as Mino, OCI-ly10 and TMD8. 2. At the same time, HZ-Q1070 catalyzes the mutated BTK degradation (C481S\/C481Y\/C481F\/T474M) and potently inhibits growth of BTK inhibitor-resistant tumor cell lines. 3. In proteomic analysis assay, HZ-Q1070 can selectively degrade BTK. 4. HZ-Q1070 has been engineered to avoid Aiolos and Ikaros degradation and therefore does not show IMiD activity. 5. Mechanistic investigation of indicates that HZ-Q1070 can function through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). 6. In the PK\/PD experiments, HZ-Q1070 shows excellent pharmacokinetic properties and BTK degradation activity <i>in vivo<\/i>. 7. HZ-Q1070 demonstrates robust tumor growth inhibition in TMD8 and Mino xenograft mouse model. Doses as low as 3 mg\/kg demonstrates a significant inhibitory effect.<br \/>Conclusion: In summary, HZ-Q1070 is a potent and highly selective BTK degrader against both BTK-WT and multiple BTK inhibitors-resistant mutations. In vivo, HZ-Q1070 exhibits excellent pharmacokinetic properties, BTK degradation activity and robust tumor growth inhibition in TMD8 and Mino mouse xenograft tumor model. These findings support further clinical development of HZ-Q1070 for the treatment of B cell malignancies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"BTK,Mutations,PROTAC,Proteasome-mediated degradation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xingguo Liu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yubo Zhou<sup>2<\/sup>, Yizhe Wu<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiaomin Luo<sup>2<\/sup>, Jiangfeng Xie<sup>1<\/sup>, Xinxin Jin<sup>1<\/sup>, Jia Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Xinglu Zhou<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>HealZen Therapeutics Co.,Ltd., Hangzhou, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"48867787-994a-42b5-8535-998f132d687c","ControlNumber":"2696","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>X.

Though initially responding to treatment with a BTK inhibitor, many patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), or Waldenstr&#246;m macroglobulinemia (WM) eventually progressed and clinical responses to BTK inhibitors are often poor in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients. These highlight the need to understand the resistance mechanisms and improve responses to BTK inhibitors. The serine\/threonine protein kinase IRAK4 is a key modulator of MYD88, which is found to be mutated in various aggressive B-cell lymphomas, including DLBCL. As BCR signaling and MYD88 signaling converge downstream on NF-kB activation, which plays an essential role in proliferation and survival of lymphoma cells, blockade of the two signaling pathways presents a potential therapeutic strategy. Here, we investigated the pharmacokinetic properties and anti-tumor activity of XS-04, a first-in-class dual inhibitor targeting both IRAK4 and BTK, using preclinical models of DLBCL subtypes, including tumors resistant to BTK inhibitors. XS-04 showed potent inhibition of IRAK4 and BTK kinases, with IC50 values of 0.2 and 2.9 nM, respectively. Favorable pharmacokinetic properties were also seen across multiple non-clinical species. Using in vitro anti-proliferative assays, we found that XS-04 inhibited proliferation of various DLBCL cell lines with IC50s of 30 to 40 nM. Mechanistically, XS-04 suppressed NF-kB activity in DLBCL cells and in vivo xenograft tumors, as indicated by decreased phosphorylation of IkBa. Oral dosing of XS-04 in TMD8 xenograft model led to a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth, which was comparable to the inhibition shown by a combination of BTK and IRAK4 inhibitors. In addition, XS-04 treatment resulted in tumor regression in a patient-derived ibrutinib-resistant MCL xenograft model, without significant changes in body weight. XS-04, a first-in-class IRAK4\/BTK dual inhibitor, shows broad anti-tumor activity across preclinical models of DLBCL subtypes, including tumors resistant to BTK inhibitors. These results support XS-04 as a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of hematological malignancies.

The median overall survival (OS) of GBM patients is poor (1-2 years) on standard of care therapies, which include surgery, radiotherapy, and the alkylating agent temozolomide. Therefore, developing new treatments for GBM is an urgent unmet medical need. TNG908 is a clinical stage MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor that inhibits PRMT5 activity selectively in MTAP-null cells leveraging a synthetic lethal interaction. Approximately 40% of GBM tumors are homozygous null for MTAP [1, 2]. In preclinical in vitro studies, the antiproliferation activity of TNG908 was 15 times more potent in MTAP-null cancer cell lines than in MTAP WT cells. TNG908 has high passive permeability and is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein nor Breast Cancer Resistant Protein efflux transporters, attributes which are favorable for crossing the blood-brain barrier. TNG908 demonstrated in vivo brain penetration in multiple preclinical studies, including non-human primates and mice, suggesting that TNG908 may fulfill the significant unmet need in the treatment of GBM. Pharmacodynamic activity of TNG908 to inhibit PRMT5 was demonstrated by decreased SDMA-modified protein levels in a dose-dependent manner in a GBM xenograft model. TNG908 demonstrated dose-dependent antitumor activity in multiple hyper- and hypomethylated GBM subcutaneous models, including cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models. Despite reduced Kpuu in rodents compared to primates, oral administration of TNG908 drove near tumor stasis and increased median survival by 3-fold in a highly aggressive murine GBM orthotopic model. In summary, TNG908 is a potent, brain-penetrant small molecule PRMT5 inhibitor that is selective for MTAP-null tumor cells with good drug-like properties and strong antitumor activity in preclinical models of GBM. As such, TNG908 may provide a novel treatment strategy for MTAP-deleted GBM patients. *MZ and AT contributed equally to the work.<br \/>Reference: 1.Cerami et al., Cell, 2013. 2.Gao et al., Sci Signal, 2013","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Glioblastoma,Synthetic lethality,Preclinical,Blood-brain barrier,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Minjie Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Alice Tsai<sup><\/sup>, Kevin  M.

HPK1 is a key inhibitory signaling node associated with T cell exhaustion that is activated in response to T cell receptor engagement (signal 1). HPK1 is thus distinct from inhibitory checkpoint receptors which require surface receptor expression, antigen recognition (signal 1) and costimulatory engagement (signal 2) for activity. HPK1 therefore has<b> <\/b>potential for broader activity across T cell subsets independent of checkpoint engagement. Selectivity is a critical parameter for the optimal profile of an HPK1 inhibitor because many kinases are positive regulators of T cell signaling and can be antagonistic if inhibited. Utilizing a structure-based drug design approach, we identified compound 1 a highly potent (pSLP76 IC<sub>50<\/sub>=55nM) inhibitor of HPK1, which displayed no functional antagonistic effects in human T cells up to 30&#956;M. We attributed this its highly selective nature, possessing &#62;80-fold selectivity against other MAP4K family members, and &#62;25-fold selectivity against all other kinases tested. We demonstrated an inverse correlation between inhibition of pSLP76 and increase in IL-2, IFNg and proliferation in human T cells. We report a novel role for HPK1 in regulating T cell exhaustion in a human ex vivo assay. Compound 1 treatment prevents T cell exhaustion at <u>&#62;<\/u> 0.1uM and can restore aspects of already exhausted T cells, most notably rescue of cytotoxicity. RNAseq and nuclear localization assays reveal for the first time that HPK1i mechanistically restores AP-1 signaling which enables heterodimerization with NFAT restoring human T cell functionality. We present data demonstrating that our HPK1 inhibitor elevates anti-tumor immunity in multiple syngeneic mouse models including MCA205, CT26 and EMT6. In vitro IC50 correlates with in vivo decrease of pSLP76 in tumors and blood of syngeneic models associated with efficacy. Immunophenotyping from syngeneic tumors treated with compound 1 shows a two-fold increase in CD8<sup>+ <\/sup>T cells and most significantly enhanced cytokine production in T cells. In patient NSCLC samples Compound 1 has single agent and combination activity with Durvalumab restoring cytokine production. These results thus reveal the role of AP-1 \/NFAT signaling in HPK1 biology and highlight the importance of HPK1 in T cell exhaustion in both healthy donor and NSCLC patient tumor T cells, potentially limiting responses to ICB.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET09-04 Novel antitumor agents,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,T cell,Immuno-oncology,Small molecule inhibitor,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Deanna A.
