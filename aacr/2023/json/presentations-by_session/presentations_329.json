[{"Abstract":"<b>Background:<\/b> cfDNA methylation profiling allows early cancer detection and tissue-of-origin classification. Recent studies show that end repair (ER) process during double strand library preparation (dsLibP) introduces differential methylation signals between original and repaired sequences. We hypothesized that algorithmic correction of cfDNA jagged-ends could allow superior cfDNA methylation profiling performance, and better preserve double-stranded cfDNA molecules.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We introduce JEEPERS (Jagged-End Error Polishing of Enzymatically misRepaired Sequences), a novel approach for correction of such errors in dsLibP methylation data. Specifically, JEEPERS is not only able to detect and quantify ER-induced errors at JEs, but also to correct them in silico. When using double-stranded unique molecular identifiers, JEEPERS leverages support from 2 sources to identify\/correct errors at JEs: 1) complementary strands from individual DNA duplexes, and 2) sibling reads from other, non-jagged cfDNA families. JEEPERS relies on the 5&#8217;&#62;3&#8217; polarity of ER-associated errors and JE length profiles to correct R2 for longer fragments and both R1\/2 for shorter ones.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> We quantified the prevalence of such errors at JEs of double-stranded cfDNA molecules in plasma of 2 healthy subjects. We compared library preparations on single- (SPLAT-Seq) vs double-stranded DNA (EM-Seq), and strikingly found ~40% of CpGs to be involved in jagged cfDNA ends and impacted by misrepair during enzymatic ER of dsDNA. This resulted in an artifactual 13.1-16.3% lower global methylation across the genome, an effect that was exaggerated in hypermethylated (hyper) regions (~69% of genome). While ER-associated misrepair resulted in ~10.2% lower CpG methylation within the first 110bp of cfDNA fragments (R1 AUC=0.95, R2 AUC=0.81), when comparing R1\/R2, the final 30bp showed even larger biases (13.8-77.4%). Remarkably, JEEPERS could accurately detect and correct these biases and produce highly uniform R1\/R2 profiles in EM-Seq on par with SPLAT-Seq, even when considering short cfDNA fragments (&#60;141bp) with substantial JE fractions. We also compared JEEPERS performance with other methods, including simple JE trimming or reliance on R1 alone, finding superior performance by JEEPERS for methylation quantification.<br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: ER distorts a large fraction of CpGs across the genome clustering at cfDNA fragment ends, resulting in substantially decreased methylation levels in cfDNA. JEEPERS accurately recovers methylation levels distorted by such misrepair. This not only enables more accurate methylation levels, but also retains cfDNA fragmentation features and duplex information. These advantages allow not only superior cfDNA genotyping of germline and somatic variants, but also enable better identification of allele-specific methylation, hemi-methylation, and gene expression inferences, as relevant for cancer detection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Epigenomics,Cell-free DNA,Cancer diagnostics,Methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Rui Wang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Emily  G.

There is currently no single effective screening tool for high risk or community-based risk assessment for HGSOC and multivariate tests for preselected patients are suboptimal. In women with a known pelvic mass, surgery followed pathological assessment is currently the only definitive way to diagnose HGSOC. About 15% of women with a suspicious mass will have HGSOC and less than 15% will present with stage 1 cancer. A liquid biopsy assay based on cell-free (cf)DNA enables non-invasive dynamic assessment of disease status in patients with cancer where cfDNA methylation is particularly promising for detection of early stage HGSOC. The goal of the current study is to develop a cfDNA methylation liquid biopsy that can be used for the screening and risk assessment for HGSOC.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Tissue and plasma samples were acquired under informed consent from multiple commercial and academic sources. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) was performed on 33 HGSOC tissues as well as 8 normal ovary and 13 normal fallopian tube controls. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were called between HGSOC and normal controls using metilene and DSS. DMR calls with p-values &#60; 0.05 and |&#945;&#946;| &#62; 0.45 (n = 1677 DMRs) were used to generate a targeted tissue-based methylation assay using the myBaits<sup>&#174;<\/sup> hybrid probe capture platform (Daicel Arbor Biosciences). Next, targeted enrichment was performed on bisulfite converted plasma cfDNA on an independent set of 84 HGSOC samples (27 stage 1, 20 stage 2, 37 stage 3) and 100 samples from patients with benign ovarian masses. Mean beta value across DMRs were used to train a novel cfDNA methylation classifier model called OvaPrint<sup>TM<\/sup> to discriminate HGSOC from benign masses using a repeated 3-fold cross validation approach to obtain an unbiased estimate of the performance of the classifier. The average cross validated score for each sample was used to generate a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>. RRBS analysis on HGSOC tissue and normal tissue controls demonstrated excellent separation of HGSOC from normal tissue samples using the selected DMRs.

However, the CTC detection is difficult because of the rarity of CTCs, especially in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the detection sensitivity of CTCs was reported to be less than 50% in NSCLC patients. Herein, we developed a novel CTC detection system and evaluated its performance in advanced NSCLC patients.<br \/>Methods: Whole blood samples were collected from stage IV or recurrence NSCLC patients. CTC detection was performed with a novel system (Sysmex Corporation, Hyogo, Japan) by using size-dependent enrichment for capturing CTCs and immunofluorescent staining reagents including anti-cytokeratin (CK, AE1\/AE3 or CK8\/18) (specific for epithelial cells), anti-CD45 (specific for leukocyte) and Hoechst (for nucleus). Fluorescence intensity and cell images of each marker were obtained by Molecular Imaging Flow Cytometry (MI-FCM). Circulating cells that were positive for Hoechst and anti-CK but negative for anti-CD45 were defined as CTCs. To confirm whether CTCs detected were derived from lung cancer origin, CTCs obtained from patients with <i>EGFR<\/i> mutations were subjected to single cell sorting, whole genome amplification and PCR analysis for the mutation detection.<br \/>Results: A total of 20 NSCLC patients (10 <i>EGFR<\/i> mutant, 10 <i>EGFR<\/i> wild-type) were enrolled in this study. Of these, CTCs were detected in 16 (80%) patients (number of CTCs, 1 to 66 in 4.5ml whole blood) when CK8\/18 was used as epithelial cell staining, but in only 11 (55%) patients (1 to 6 CTCs) when using AE1\/AE3. The detection sensitivity of CTCs based on CK8\/18 was significantly higher compared to that based on AE1\/AE3 in our novel system (80% vs. 50%, p = 0.03). The number of CTCs was significantly lower in <i>EGFR<\/i> mutation-positive patients than in <i>EGFR<\/i> wild-type patients (median number of CTCs, 3 vs. 22, <i>p<\/i> = 0.01). Furthermore, among 10 <i>EGFR<\/i> mutation-positive patients, <i>EGFR<\/i> mutations were detected in CTCs derived from 6 (60%) patients. All the mutation types detected in CTCs were matched with those identified in the corresponding primary tumors.<br \/>Conclusion: Our novel CTC detection system demonstrated that the detection rate of CTCs (80%) was higher than those in previous studies. Further studies are needed for the clinical application of this system.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Liquid biopsies,Single cell,EGFR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tetsuya Sakai<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yoshitaka Zenke<sup>1<\/sup>, Mami Onishi<sup>2<\/sup>, Eri Morita<sup>2<\/sup>, Masatoshi Yanagida<sup>2<\/sup>, Yuji Shibata<sup>1<\/sup>, Hiroki Izumi<sup>1<\/sup>, Kaname Nosaki<sup>1<\/sup>, Hibiki Udagawa<sup>1<\/sup>, Shingo Matsumoto<sup>1<\/sup>, Kiyotaka Yoh<sup>1<\/sup>, Koichi Goto<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>National Cancer Center Hospital East, Chiba, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Sysmex Corporation, Hyogo, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e0c8ee67-4199-48dd-94c1-2cfe9f626ca9","ControlNumber":"2366","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;T.

We aimed to assess TMB based on whole exome sequencing (WES) using extracellular vesicles (EV)-derived DNA isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and determine the correlation of TMB between BALF and tissue.<br \/>Methods: Patients diagnosed with advanced NSCLC and who were treated with pembrolizumab between December 2018 and December 2021 were included in this multicenter translational cohort study. The correlation of TMB between BALF and tissue measured by WES was evaluated by Spearman&#8217;s rank correlation coefficient in matched BALF and tissue samples from 62 patients. We analyzed the association of BALF TMB level with progression-free survival (PFS) and response to pembrolizumab.<br \/>Results: Of 62 patients, 47 (75.8%) had evaluable tissue TMB and 57 (91.9%) had evaluable BALF TMB. There were no significant differences between BALF and tissue with regards to DNA amounts, estimated library size, mean depth, and uniformity. Median tissue TMB and BALF TMB were 6.02 and 2.16 mut\/Mb, respectively. There was a weak positive correlation between tissue TMB and BALF TMB (r=0.23, p &#60; 0.001), whereas BALF TMB found higher correlations with tissue TMB in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (r=0.77, p &#60; 0.001). Neither tissue TMB nor BALF TMB showed significant differences PFS or ORR benefit for treatment with pembrolizumab, however the BALF TMB of patients who had been treated with pembrolizumab for more than 6 months was higher than that of those who did not (p=0.039).<br \/>Conclusions: The findings suggest that NGS using BALF EV DNA is feasible for TMB calculation to overcome the matter of small biopsy issue in advanced NSCLC patients, which may play a supplementary serve as a potential biomarker of clinical benefit in patients with NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Extracellular vesicles,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Tumor mutational burden,Pembrolizumab,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Heejoung Kim<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jaeyoung Hur<sup>2<\/sup>, Wan Seop Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, In Ae Kim<sup>3<\/sup>, Dong Il Park<sup>4<\/sup>, In-Jae Oh<sup>5<\/sup>, Kye Young Lee<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Konkuk University Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Precision Medicine Lung Cancer Center, Department of Pathology, Konkuk University Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>3<\/sup>Precision Medicine Lung Cancer Center, Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Konkuk University Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>4<\/sup>Division of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Med, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea, Republic of,<sup>5<\/sup>Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Hospital, Gwangju, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c2443af3-0cbe-4f9a-90a6-3985fb577646","ControlNumber":"3434","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

Here we present a retrospective case-control study evaluating the performance of a novel genome-wide methylome enrichment platform for MCED.<br \/>Methods: The full cohort (N=4,322) includes cancer cases (individuals with newly diagnosed treatment-na&#239;ve cancer) and age- and gender-matched non-cancer controls. Samples were analyzed with a bisulfite-free, non-degradative genome-wide DNA methylation enrichment platform using cfDNA isolated from plasma. Samples were split into distinct sets to train and test a machine learning classifier consisting of differentially methylated regions to distinguish cases from controls. Initial training in 1,536 samples across 8 cancer types is reported here (100 iterations of random splits (80:20) for cross-validation). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and 95% confidence intervals for the median probabilities are reported in the cross-validation.<br \/>Results: Cancer cases were distinguished from controls with an AUC of 0.94 (0.93, 0.96), with AUCs for individual cancer types ranging from 0.91 to 0.97. The AUC was 0.94 (0.92, 0.95) for stage I\/II cancers and 0.95 (0.94, 0.96) for stage III\/IV cancers. The AUC was 0.92 (0.91, 0.94) in the subset of cancers typically considered low shedding, with similar performance for stage I\/II (0.91; 0.89, 0.93) and stage III\/IV (0.93; 0.91, 0.95) in that subset.<br \/>Conclusions: Initial analysis of case-control data demonstrates feasibility of a genome-wide methylome enrichment platform for MCED. The high detection of low-shedding and early-stage cancers is promising for MCED applications, as this will be critical for screening to identify cancers for which treatment may be more effective.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{24F723B3-793F-432C-AE07-6169E8B6E42A}\"><caption>Overall AUC (95% CI) for the full cohort and by cancer type.<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\">Cancer Type<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">All Stages*<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Stage I\/II<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">Stage III\/IV<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">All Cancers<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">931<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">461<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">437<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">AUC (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.94 (0.93, 0.96)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.94 (0.92, 0.95)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.95 (0.94, 0.96)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">Bladder Cancer**<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">75<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">52<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">AUC (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.93 (0.91, 0.96)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.93 (0.90, 0.96)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.97 (0.95, 0.99)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">Breast Cancer**<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">131<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">76<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">37<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">AUC (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.94 (0.91, 0.96)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.92 (0.88, 0.95)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.96 (0.94, 0.98)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">Colorectal Cancer<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">N<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">182<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">94<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">88<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">AUC (95% CI)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.97 (0.96, 0.98)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.97 (0.96, 0.98)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.97 (0.96, 0.99)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\">Head &amp;

HER2 is one of the most important tumor markers which is associated with rapid cell division and the metastasis and prognosis of MBC in the clinic. More recently, we reported single CTC gene mutation is a key point to distinguish metastasis capability in MBC (2022 AACR and 2022 ASCO). Herein, we report specific gene alterations in HER2<sup>+<\/sup> single CTC compared to autologous leukocytes in MBC.<br \/>Methods: Whole blood sample (7.5ml\/each) was collected from MBC patient before therapy. CTC enumeration was performed in FDA approved CellSearch&#8482; System and then the single HER2+ CTC and leukocytes were isolated by using DEPArray<sup>TM<\/sup> System (Menarini). The single cell DNA was isolated and then the initial library was prepared by using Ampli1&#8482; Whole Genome Amplification, Ampli1&#8482; QC Kit (Menarini) and AMPure XP kit (Beckman Coulter). The exome capture was performed by TruSeq DNA Exome kit (illumine). The sequencing was prepared by NextSeq 500 mid output V2.5 kit and was performed on the NextSeq 500 (Illumina).<br \/>Results: We identified 107 CTCs including 55 HER2+ CTCs and 14 CTC-clusters. Autologous single HER2<sup>+<\/sup> CTC (HER2<sup>+<\/sup>CK<sup>+<\/sup>CD45<sup>-<\/sup>, Group 1), HER2<sup>+<\/sup>CK<sup>-<\/sup>CD45<sup>+<\/sup> leukocyte (Group 2) and HER2<sup>-<\/sup>CK<sup>-<\/sup>CD45<sup>+<\/sup> leukocyte (Group 3) were isolated and sequenced respectively. The sequencing data was processed following the GATK pipeline and annotated using SnpEff. There were 486,119 counts (56.69%) for intron variants, 175,819 counts (20.51%) for intergenic variants, 70,334 counts (8.20%) for exon variants, 50,370 counts (5.87%) for downstream genes, 45,915 counts (5.36%) for upstream genes and others (3.37%) in HER2<sup>+ <\/sup>CTC. Meanwhile, there were 71,848 (8.76%) and 0 counts for exon variants found in Group 2 and Group 3 respectively. There were 79 gene variants ((SNP and Ins-Del) identified to have the highest impact effect (&#8805;20) on HER2+ CTC chromosome, when there were 85 and 0 highest impact gene variants were identified in Group 2 and Group 3 respectively. The specific gene alterations in Group 1 compared to Group 2 includes CCNA2, FOLH1, BRD4, SAMHD1, CYP17A1, IDE, HPGDS and CTNNB1 Among the top 50 high impact gene variants, there were 26 genes alteration sites are same in both Group 1 and Group 2, including FECH, HDAC8, CYP11B2, TTN(6 sites), RAN, CD207, HK1, CASP1(2 sites), BRCA1, PIK3CG (3 sites), APEX1(4 sites), KIF11, SIRT5 (2 sites), XYLB and CHKA.<br \/>Conclusion: Genomic characterization of HER2 positive single CTCs elucidated specific gene alterations associated with disease metastasis compared to autologous leukocytes in MBC. The newfound HER2<sup>+<\/sup>CK<sup>-<\/sup>CD45<sup>+<\/sup> cells with gene alterations maybe a new kind of cancer transformed leukocytes which need further validation. Specific gene alterations will help to develop novel drugs aimed at the eradication of CTCs using molecularly driven therapies for disease metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metastasis,Circulating tumor cells,Breast cancer,HER2\/neu,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Qiang Zhang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lorenzo Gerratana<sup>2<\/sup>, Zhe Ji<sup>3<\/sup>, Xinkun Wang<sup>3<\/sup>, Paolo D’Amico<sup>3<\/sup>, Seema Singhal<sup>1<\/sup>, Youbin Zhang<sup>3<\/sup>, Andrew A.

In this project, we are evaluating the levels of whole plasma circRNAs using the nCounter technology in order to develop a prognostic signature that can aid the clinician to differentiate benign vs. malign nodules.<br \/>Methods: Plasma samples from patients with malign lung nodules (n=135) and controls (n=149), including patients with benign nodules (n=66\/149) have been collected. RNA was purified using the QIAsymphony DSP Virus\/Pathogen Midi Kit in a QIAsymphony robot (Qiagen). The nCounter Low RNA Input Amplification Kit (NanoString) was used to retrotranscribe and pre-amplify 4 &#956;L of plasma RNA. Overnight hybridization and posterior nCounter processing (NanoString) steps were carried out following the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. Differential expression and machine learning (ML) methods were performed for the development of a lung cancer signature.<br \/>Results: Preliminary analysis of the 88 samples first included in the study shown a cluster of 6 circRNAs differentially expressed in lung cancer. Among these circRNAs, circSMAD2, circCOL11A1, circCHST15, and circFUT8 were upregulated, while circACP3 and circLYPLAL1 were found downregulated in plasma of lung cancer patients. In addition, a 64-circRNA signature selected by ML was able to differentiate NSCLC patients from controls, including those with benign nodules, The algorithm assigned signature scores to samples, which ranged from 0 to 1. Using a cut-off value of 0.5, preliminary signature was able to classify samples with an AUC ROC of 0.90 and accuracy of 78.41% (CI = 68.35% - 86.47%) with the final model.<br \/>Conclusion: Using ML on nCounter analysis of 88 samples, we have generated a preliminary 64-circRNA signature in plasma predictive of early-stage NSCLC. Final results in the entire cohort of 294 samples will be presented at the meeting.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,RNA,Early detection,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Carlos Pedraz Valdunciel<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Giovanna Casagrande<sup>2<\/sup>, Elizabeth Martínez-Pérez<sup>3<\/sup>, Ana Gimenez-Capitán<sup>1<\/sup>, Joselyn Valarezo<sup>1<\/sup>, Pablo Rubinstein<sup>4<\/sup>, Andrés Aguilar-Hernández<sup>5<\/sup>, Leticia Ferro-Leal<sup>2<\/sup>, Cristina Marino-Buslje<sup>3<\/sup>, Rui Reis<sup>2<\/sup>, Rafael Rosell<sup>6<\/sup>, Miguel Ángel Molina-Vila<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Laboratory of Oncology, Pangaea Oncology, Barcelona, Spain,<sup>2<\/sup>Molecular Oncology Research Center, Hospital de Amor, Barrertos, Brazil,<sup>3<\/sup>Bioinformatics Unit, Fundación Instituto Leloir, Buenos Aires, Argentina,<sup>4<\/sup>Hospital El Pilar, Barcelona, Spain,<sup>5<\/sup>Oncology Institute Dr Rosell, Barcelona, Spain,<sup>6<\/sup>Cancer Biology and Precision Medicine Department, Germans Trias i Pujol Health Institute, Badalona, Spain","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a1370ab2-48e7-4961-b3f2-8008db0765fd","ControlNumber":"4500","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

However, tissue biopsy is invasive and repeated testing is generally not possible. Liquid biopsy allows minimally invasive, repeat sample collection for regular monitoring. This study combined ANGLE&#8217;s Parsortix<sup>&#174;<\/sup> PR1 Research System*, an epitope-independent microfluidic device that isolates and harvests rare cells from blood based on size and deformability, with two downstream assays: an Immunofluorescence (IF) assay for HER2 protein detection and an IF assay combined with FISH targeting <i>HER2<\/i> gene amplification, to determine HER2 status on circulating tumor cells (CTCs).<br \/>Methods: Blood was collected from healthy volunteers into Streck Cell-Free DNA tubes. Two aliquots of blood from each donor were spiked with cultured SKBR3 (HER2+) and Hs 578T (HER2-) breast cancer cells and then processed using Parsortix<sup>&#174;<\/sup> PR1 instruments. Captured cells were harvested and spun onto positively charged slides. One slide per donor was stained using ANGLE&#8217;s IF panel for CTC detection, consisting of a nuclear dye, antibodies targeting epithelial and mesenchymal markers, and antibodies targeting blood cell markers. After imaging, slides were de-stained and processed using a commercially available <i>HER2<\/i> FISH kit. Cancer cells identified by the IF panel were re-imaged to examine FISH signal. Cells were considered <i>HER2<\/i>+ if the ratio of <i>HER2<\/i> foci to <i>CEP17<\/i> foci was &#8805;2. The second slide was stained using the same IF CTC panel in combination with an antibody targeting HER2 protein. HER2 expression was analyzed based on intensity of fluorescence signal. Same workflow was implemented in a small cohort of breast cancer patients with blood processed 72-144 hours post-draw using Parsortix<sup>&#174;<\/sup> PC1 Clinical System.<br \/>Results: The numbers of epithelial and mesenchymal CTCs detected on each slide were comparable in both assays. In <i>HER2<\/i> FISH-stained samples, 97.3% of the SKBR3 cells and 13.3% of the Hs 578T cells harvested showed <i>HER2 <\/i>amplification. This data was consistent with the literature (~20% of Hs 578T cells tend to form isochromosomes, altering the <i>HER2\/CEP17<\/i> ratio). In IF-only stained samples, 96.8% of the SKBR3 cells and 0% of the Hs578T cells harvested overexpressed HER2 protein. In patient samples, CTCs were identified in 80% of the donors (mean: 21; median: 6; range: 0-200), with 17% of the CTC-positive donors having &#8805;1 CTC overexpressing HER2 protein.<br \/>Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of HER2 evaluation using IF for protein expression and <i>HER2<\/i> FISH for gene amplification on CTCs enriched from blood using the Parsortix<sup>&#174;<\/sup> systems. It also demonstrates that blood collection in Streck tubes is suitable for both assays, with the advantage of allowing longer blood sample storage and facilitating batch shipping and processing of clinical samples. *Research Use Only.

Due to its non-invasive nature, it is often preferred over tissue biopsies, especially when sequential biopsies are warranted. Here, we report the clinical utility of liquid biopsy in patients with advanced NSCLC and <i>ALK<\/i>, <i>ROS1 <\/i>or <i>RET <\/i>fusions and its relevance to detect resistance after targeted therapy.<br \/><b><\/b> <b>Methods<\/b> Between December 2020 and June 2022, 597 patients with advanced lung cancer had at least one liquid biopsy assessed by Foundation One CDx Liquid (panel of 324 genes) in a single institution. Plasma collection was performed in treatment-na&#239;ve patients and\/or at time of progression. Clinical and molecular data were collected from patients with known fusions (<i>ALK, ROS1, RET<\/i>). LB were defined as &#8220;positive&#8221; if the fusion or resistance mutations were identified and &#8220;negative&#8221; in the absence of circulating-tumor DNA. The clinical utility of LB was evaluated as the proportion of positive results. The clinical relevance for resistance detection was defined as the proportion of LB that identified a putative resistance mechanism after targeted therapy.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> A total of 68 patients (29 <i>ALK<\/i>+, 22 <i>RET<\/i>+ and 17 <i>ROS1<\/i>+) with 83 LB were included. Patients were females in 50% of cases, had no smoking history in 58% of cases and had adenocarcinoma in 91% of cases. LB was positive in 55\/83 (66%) cases overall, in 14\/15 (93%) treatment-na&#239;ve patients and in 39\/66 (59%) pre-treated patients. Factors significantly associated with a negative LB were limited disease progression (brain- or thoracic-only, p&#60;0.001) and ongoing treatment at time of LB collection (p&#60;0.05). Out of 47 LB performed at progression after targeted therapies, 7 (15%) found on-target resistance, 10 (21%) by-pass resistance, 10 (21%) no explainable resistance and 20 (43%) were negative. By-pass alterations included <i>KRAS<\/i> p.G12C\/A mutations (N=2, <i>ALK<\/i>+), <i>PIK3CA <\/i>p.E545K\/Q (N=3, <i>ALK<\/i>+), <i>PTEN<\/i> splice-site mutation (N=1, <i>RET<\/i>+), <i>MYC<\/i> amplifications (N=3, <i>ALK<\/i>+ \/ <i>RET<\/i>+) and <i>MET<\/i> amplification (N=1, <i>ROS1<\/i>+).<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b> LB was able to detect resistance mechanisms in one third of NSCLC patients with <i>ALK, RET<\/i> or <i>ROS1<\/i> fusions. However, LB frequently failed to detect circulating-tumor DNA especially in patients with limited disease progression or with ongoing treatment at time of sample collection.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,NSCLC,Fusion genes,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mihaela Aldea<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Arianna Marinello<sup><\/sup>, Marco Tagliamento<sup><\/sup>, Filippo Dall'Olio<sup><\/sup>, Damien Vasseur<sup><\/sup>, Arnaud Bayle<sup><\/sup>, Anas Gazzah<sup><\/sup>, Miruna Grecea<sup><\/sup>, Claudio Nicotra<sup><\/sup>, Ludovic Lacroix<sup><\/sup>, Santiago Ponce<sup><\/sup>, Luc Friboulet<sup><\/sup>, Fabrice Barlesi<sup><\/sup>, Fabrice Andre<sup><\/sup>, David Planchard<sup><\/sup>, Etienne Rouleau<sup><\/sup>, Antoine Italiano<sup><\/sup>, Benjamin Besse<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cb1143d1-a1d6-4815-aeb4-87a365c347d5","ControlNumber":"5354","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

In a Ph2 trial of tebe in previously treated mUM, OS was improved regardless of RECIST best response and the degree of early reduction in ctDNA was a better predictor of OS [Carvajal Nat Med 2022]. Here we sought to replicate these results in the Ph3 trial of tebe in 1L mUM pts.<br \/>Methods: 1L HLA-A*02:01 pts with mUM received 68mcg tebe weekly iv after intra-patient dose escalation (NCT03070392). RECISTv1.1 assessed by investigators. Sera (N=202) collected at baseline (BL) and week 9 on tebe were analyzed for ctDNA using targeted mPCR-NGS assay for mutations in 15 genes including GNAQ, GNA11, SF3B1, CYSLTR2, PLCB4 and EIF1AX. OS was analyzed in subsets with &#62;0-3 log reductions in mean tumor molecules (MTM) per ml of serum on treatment. Data cutoff 4-Apr-2022.<br \/>Results: 123\/202 (61%) evaluable pts had detectable ctDNA mutations in one or more UM genes at baseline. MTM at BL was correlated with tumor burden as assessed by sum of longest diameters (Spearman&#8217;s &#961;=0.62, P=1.6e-14). By week 9, ctDNA reduction was observed in 108 (88%) pts, including 61\/73 with RECIST response of progressive disease (PD), 34\/36 with stable disease (SD) and 13\/14 with partial response (PR). Deeper reductions in ctDNA were associated with progressively longer OS (Table 1). Best overall responses in pts with ctDNA clearance on tebe were PD in 20 (44%), SD in 16 (36%) and PR in 9 (20%).<br \/>Conclusions: In this Ph3 trial, ctDNA reduction by week 9 on tebentafusp was strongly associated with improved OS, even in pts with best RECIST response of PD or SD, confirming the Ph2 data. Early ctDNA reduction, which occurs at a much higher frequency than RECIST response, may be a better surrogate of tebentafusp efficacy in mUM.<table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{6A5904BC-A660-42BC-968C-BB22E51E0CE1}\"><caption>Table1 *HRs estimated from Kaplan-Meier analysis for subsets above v below ctDNA reduction threshold<\/caption><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>ctDNA subset<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>N (%)<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>OS hazard ratio (95% CI)*<\/b><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><b>1-year OS %<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">ctDNA absent at baseline<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">79\/202 (39%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">90%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:11.0pt;line-height: 107%;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA\">ctDNA detected at baseline<\/span><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">123\/202 (61%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">62%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:11.0pt;line-height: 107%;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No decrease by week 9<\/span><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">15\/123 (12%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">NA<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">43%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:11.0pt;line-height: 107%;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA\">Any (&gt;0 log) decrease by week 9<\/span><\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">108\/123 (88%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.51 (0.28-0.96)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">64%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#8805;0.1 log<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">105\/123&nbsp;(85%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.48 (0.27-0.84)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">65%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#8805;0.5 log<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">88\/123&nbsp;(72%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.47 (0.3-0.74)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">70%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#8805;1 log<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">65\/123&nbsp;(53%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.33 (0.21-0.51)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">80%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#8805;2 log<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">50\/123&nbsp;(41%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.32 (0.2-0.51)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">82%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">&#8805;3 log (clearance)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">45\/123&nbsp;(37%)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">0.28 (0.17-0.46)<\/td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">86%<\/td><\/tr><\/table>","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,Immunotherapy,Uveal melanoma,T cell engager,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ryan Sullivan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Laura Collins<sup>2<\/sup>, Manuel Rodrigues<sup>3<\/sup>, Paul Nathan<sup>4<\/sup>, Jessica  C.

In patients with very few copies of tumor DNA circulating in the blood, the blood sampling process becomes a potentially limiting factor. For ctDNA methods based on a single or a few genomic targets, it becomes stochastic whether the collected sample contains any tumor DNA fragments from targeted regions. To overcome this sampling limitation, we developed C2inform; a whole genome sequencing (WGS) approach, which detects ctDNA using a cumulative patient-specific signal from thousands of mutations throughout the entire genome.<br \/>Aim: Here, we aim to I) evaluate the performance of C2inform in patients with UICC stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) using samples collected after the end of curatively intended treatment and serially during surveillance, II) assess the inter-lab reproducibility of C2inform and, III) investigate the potential for using the serial WGS data to track tumor genomic evolution in recurrence patients.<br \/>Methods: From a cohort of 146 stage III CRC patients, including 37 patients with recurrence, 2 mL plasma samples were collected serially for up to three years (n = 1309, median 10 samples per patient). By WGS of tumor and blood-derived normal DNA, a mutational signature was established for each patient. Enhanced by an AI-based error suppression model, this signature was used to screen 20x WGS plasma cfDNA profiles for the presence of ctDNA. To evaluate the reproducibility, paired samples (n = 2 x 187 samples) were processed and sequenced at two independent laboratories while the bioinformatics processing of samples was identical. Using coverage, split-read, and discordant read-pair information, genomic structural alterations were identified in serial plasma samples from 19 recurrence patients and compared to tissue WGS from subsequent recurrence metastasis.<br \/>Results: Preliminary results showed that detection of ctDNA after the end of treatment was associated with poor prognosis (HR = 7.1, 95% CI: 3.2-15.9). The presence of ctDNA during surveillance was a predictor of recurrence (HR = 9.5, 95% CI: 3.6-25.5) and enabled the detection of recurrence up to 21 months (median: 9.5 months) before detection by radiological imaging. We found indication of tumor evolution by searching serially collected plasma samples for novel genomic changes, which were confirmed by WGS of the metastatic tissue. Analysis of paired samples showed great reproducibility of C2inform with a high agreement between both ctDNA detection (Cohens Kappa = 0.9) and the estimated ctDNA level (r&#178; = 0.99).<br \/>Conclusion: C2inform showed great inter-lab reproducibility and enabled prediction of recurrence after treatment and during surveillance. Thus, C2inform has the potential to guide clinical decision-making during the postoperative management of CRC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,Colorectal cancer,Whole genome sequencing,Circulating cell-free DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Amanda Frydendahl<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jesper Nors<sup>1<\/sup>, Mads Heilskov<sup>1<\/sup>, Ester Ellegaard Sørensen<sup>1<\/sup>, Thomas Reinert<sup>1<\/sup>, Jesper Bramsen<sup>1<\/sup>, Danielle Afterman<sup>2<\/sup>, Tomer Lauterman<sup>2<\/sup>, Maja Kuzman<sup>3<\/sup>, Santiago Gonzalez<sup>3<\/sup>, Dunja Glavas<sup>3<\/sup>, James Samdbeck<sup>3<\/sup>, Dillon Maloney<sup>3<\/sup>, Jurica Levatic<sup>3<\/sup>, Sunil Deochand<sup>3<\/sup>, Michael Yahalom<sup>2<\/sup>, Ryan Ptashkin<sup>3<\/sup>, Iman Tavassoly<sup>3<\/sup>, Zohar Donenhirsh<sup>2<\/sup>, Eric White<sup>3<\/sup>, Ravi Kandasamy<sup>3<\/sup>, Ury Alon<sup>2<\/sup>, Paz Polak<sup>3<\/sup>, Anders Husted Madsen<sup>4<\/sup>, Uffe Schou Løve<sup>5<\/sup>, Per Vadgaard Andersen<sup>6<\/sup>, Ole Thorlacius-Ussing<sup>7<\/sup>, Lene Hjerrild Iversen<sup>1<\/sup>, Kåre Andersson Gotschalck<sup>8<\/sup>, Boris Oklander<sup>2<\/sup>, Asaf Zviran<sup>3<\/sup>, Claus Lindbjerg Andersen<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark,<sup>2<\/sup>C2i Genomics, LTD, Haifa, Israel,<sup>3<\/sup>C2i Genomics, INC, New York City, NY,<sup>4<\/sup>Herning Regional Hospital, Herning, Denmark,<sup>5<\/sup>Viborg Regional Hospital, Viborg, Denmark,<sup>6<\/sup>Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark,<sup>7<\/sup>Institute of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark,<sup>8<\/sup>Horsens Regional Hospital, Horsens, Denmark","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"afb239f3-41b2-4f37-903f-990e229043de","ControlNumber":"789","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Currently, fixed and personalized panel-based tumor-informed (TI) ctDNA testing strategies are available for MRD assessment. Here, we aim to evaluate the prognostic value of MRD in resectable gastric cancer (GC) and assess MRD with fixed and personalized panels for comparison.<br \/>Methods: We prospectively enrolled patients with stage I-III GC who underwent R0 resection at Ruijin Hospital. Blood samples were collected on the day of surgery preoperatively and during the second-fourth week postoperatively. Tissue samples were collected shortly thereafter at the time of curative-intent resection. Both the Patient-specific pROgnostic and Potential tHErapeutic marker Tracking (brPROPHET, a personalized panel-based TI assay, Burning Rock Biotech) and a 168-gene panel-based TI assay (Burning Rock Biotech) were used to quantify ctDNA.<br \/>Results: A total of 55 patients (19 females and 36 males) with a median age of 65 years (range: 35-87) were enrolled. Precise 5 and 41 patients were treated with neoadjuvant therapy and adjuvant therapy, respectively. The median duration of follow-up was 784 days (range: 582-853). All patients underwent the fixed panel-based TI assay. Of which, 19 patients were collected with postoperative blood samples. The MRD status of postoperative blood by the fixed panel showed a significant association with recurrence-free survival (RFS, MRD-positive [MRD<sup>+<\/sup>] vs. MRD-negative [MRD<sup>-<\/sup>]: 484 days vs. not reached [NR], hazard ratio [HR] = 8.0, p = 0.02). Of the 55 enrolled patients, 19 patients underwent both personalized and fixed panel-based TI assays. For the personalized panel, preoperative ctDNA<sup> <\/sup>was detected in 94.7% (18\/19) of the patients with 100% (4\/4), 66.7% (2\/3), and 91.7% (11\/12) in stage I, II, and III, respectively. The numbers were 36.8% (7\/19), 0% (0\/4), 0% (0\/3), and 58.3% (7\/12) with the fixed panel, respectively. Among the 19 patients, three of the 13 patients who had postoperative blood samples developed tumor recurrence during the follow-up visit. The sensitivity of the personalized panel for predicting tumor recurrence achieved 100% (3\/3) with 90% (9\/10) specificity. The sensitivity of the fixed panel was 33.3% (1\/3) with 100% (10\/10) specificity. In addition, patients with MRD<sup>+<\/sup> by the personalized panel had a significantly shorter RFS than those with MRD<sup>-<\/sup> (566 days vs. NR, HR &#62; 100, p = 0.003).<br \/>Conclusion: Our study indicates that MRD<i><sup>+<\/sup><\/i> by either the personalized or fixed panel was associated with an unfavorable survival outcome. ctDNA-based MRD detection by the personalized panel-based TI assay might be a powerful prognostic biomarker to identify GC patients who underwent radical resection at a higher risk of relapse or with an unfavorable survival outcome.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gastrointestinal cancers: stomach,Prognostic markers,Circulating tumor DNA,Recurrence,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Pei Xue<sup>1<\/sup>, Yanfei Shao<sup>1<\/sup>, Xueliang Zhou<sup>1<\/sup>, Haiyan Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Yang Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Chenyang Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Hao Zhang<sup>2<\/sup>, Bing Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Shuo Shi<sup>2<\/sup>, Haiwei Du<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Jing Sun<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Burning Rock Biotech, Guangzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"218c9bff-f1a4-4bad-8ab1-a6022912ab36","ControlNumber":"4059","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

Detection and quantification of MRD through tumor-informed (TI) and tumor-agnostic (TA) fixed panel assays in the same samples were conducted for a head-to-head comparison.<br \/>Results: ctDNA was detected by PROPHET prior to treatment in 45% of samples (83%, 75% and 23% for disease stage III, II and I), and showed a higher positive rate than the TI and TA assays (22% and 19%). PROPHET identified 30 more ctDNA positive patients with a median ctDNA fraction of 0.01% at baseline. From the landmark single test, the sensitivity was 45%; integrating longitudinal time points increased the sensitivity to 85%. Landmark PROPHET status was the only risk factor other than clinical features to predict the clinical relapse (p&#60;0.001, multivariate Cox model). MRD positive patients defined by non-canonical variants (n=8) had similar disease-free survival (DFS) as MRD positive patients defined by canonical variants (n=9). Landmark PROPHET-based MRD status combined with clinical TNM stage outperformed TNM stage for prediction of prognosis (p&#60;0.001). Longitudinal MRD achieved negative predictive value (NPV) of 99% with an interval of 150 days, and demonstrated 299 days of longer lead-time than other state-of-the-art fixed-panel assays. Among 16 patients with equivocal radiological diagnosis, all the MRD positive patients relapsed (n=6). Among relapsed patients received next-line treatments, 7 ctDNA negative patients survived or died other disease, 67% (2\/3) ctDNA positive patients died from cancer. Sensitivity for bone and brain metastasis was 100% (11\/11) and 50% (2\/4), respectively.<br \/>Conclusion: The sensitive tumor-informed personalized MRD approach could provide advantages in prognosis prediction at landmark and disease assessment during surveillance for NSCLC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,MRD,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Kezhong Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Chenyang Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Haifeng Shen<sup>1<\/sup>, Xi Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Yichen Jin<sup>1<\/sup>, Shuailai Wu<sup>2<\/sup>, Fujun Qiu<sup>2<\/sup>, Qiang Lu<sup>2<\/sup>, Di Peng<sup>2<\/sup>, Shuai Fang<sup>2<\/sup>, Bing Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Juan Lv<sup>2<\/sup>, Jinlei Song<sup>2<\/sup>, Yang Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Shannon Chuai<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Zhihong Zhang<\/b><sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Peking University People’s Hospital, Beijing, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Burning Rock Dx, Guangzhou, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"fcb6b892-8459-4798-a669-b2619f4762bd","ControlNumber":"3418","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>K.

While ctDNA cannot predict transcriptomic and proteomic changes in response to therapy, we can measure direct cell surface antigen and gene expression changes in CTCs. In pediatric settings, blood samples are often collected from multi-institutional trials. Therefore, to translate liquid biopsies into routine practice, it is important to explore variables most likely to impact the functionality of CTCs including time to process the sample, prospective cryopreservation, blood collection tube and fixative reagents. Cell stabilizer tubes such as Streck Cell-Free DNA, CellSave, CellRescue, or PAXgene ccfDNA have been designed to prevent cell lysis and release of genomic DNA into the plasma, often observed in standard EDTA tubes. In pediatrics, we are often limited by the volume of blood we can draw for research. To this end, we have established an innovative pipeline to collect ctDNA, CTCs, and matched germline DNA from a single blood sample. Blood samples were processed for plasma extraction and CTC isolation after 4h, 24h, and 48h. We isolated rare CTCs from whole blood by combining peripheral blood cell depletion with antigen-based CTC identification. We then evaluated CTC recovery rate and cell membrane integrity (cell-membrane permeabilization) across all blood collection tubes by flow or mass cytometry. Additionally, we integrated whole transcriptome analysis of RNA transcripts in individually sorted CTCs. In this study, we detected similar levels of cell-free DNA, germline DNA and ctDNA in healthy donors and patient samples collected in the DNA stabilizer tubes up to 48h after blood collection. Surprisingly, frequent clotting was observed in the cell layer of samples collected in PAXgene tubes only 24h after blood collection, preventing further analysis of CTC quality in these tubes. At 4h, EDTA tubes and stabilizer tubes seem to perform similarly in preserving CTC integrity. However, at later timepoints, CTC recovery rate, RNA quality and cell membrane integrity were significantly higher in CellRescue tubes. Finally, we showed that CTC count, and RNA quality were slightly lower in patient samples enumerated after cryopreservation compared to the paired-samples processed the same day in both EDTA and cell-stabilizing tubes. In conclusion, we validated the CellRescue tubes as the best candidate to reduce cell lysis and protect against cell membrane permeabilization and mRNA degradation for up to 48 hours, allowing sample collection from multi-institutional studies. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to compare the key steps in handling blood samples and how this affects transcriptomic-based assay performance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Flow and mass cytometry,Circulating tumor cells,RNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anne-Florence Blandin<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Sarah Finstuen-Magro<sup><\/sup>, Samuel Abbou<sup><\/sup>, Kelly Klega<sup><\/sup>, Alejandra E.

However, discordance between MR and radiologic response was observed, hindering the potential use of MR as a surrogate endpoint. We report a meta-analysis of MR rate (MRR) and radiologic objective response rate (ORR) with ICI intervention. The relationship between MRR difference and hazard ratio of survival has also been assessed using two independent approaches.<br \/>Methods: MRR, ORR and overall survival (OS) data were compiled from 9 study arms where metastatic solid tumors were treated by ICI. Weighted least squares linear regression method was used to study the relationship between MRR and ORR. Patient level MR and OS data were downloaded from the original report (Set 1) or by digitizing Kaplan-Meier plot using Guyot algorithm (Set 2). The correlation of MRR difference between two arms and hazard ratio for OS was assessed using samples generated by bootstrapping with replacement. Similarly, a parametric simulation by fitting a piecewise exponential curve was also performed to confirm the above finding.<br \/>Results: A total of 958 patients were eligible for this analysis. A significant correlation between MRR and ORR was identified across 9 study arms after adjusting sample size (Adjusted R<sup>2<\/sup>=0.91, <i>P<\/i>&#60;0.0001). Under a hypothetical scenario of two randomized study arms, an inverse correlation between MRR difference and hazard ratio was observed using both bootstrapping and parametric simulation approaches across different conditions. A stronger negative trend was found in Set 1 compared with Set 2, where MR showed a better association with OS in the former (HR=0.27 versus HR=0.41)<br \/>Conclusions: This meta-analysis showed for the first time that ctDNA molecular response rate may be a surrogate for radiologic objective response rate in ICI and could enable early decision making. Since most of the data analyzed here is from patients with non-small cell lung cancer, the extrapolation of these findings to other tumor types needs further validation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell-free DNA,Checkpoint Inhibitors,Surrogate Endpoint,Molecular Response,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Qu Zhang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Andy Houseman<sup>1<\/sup>, Sammy Yuan<sup>1<\/sup>, Joe Harding<sup>2<\/sup>, Helen Zhou<sup>1<\/sup>, Bin Feng<sup>3<\/sup>, Michael  L.

The ability to accurately detect molecular alterations from a single plasma sample is valuable for biomarker discovery, diagnostics, and disease monitoring. However, challenges for this assay include low concentrations of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) within the cfDNA plasma fraction and PCR and sequencing errors, which can lead to decreased sensitivity in variant calling. Further, somatic mosaicism due to clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) in plasma makes accurate interpretation of LB results a challenge. Incorrect classification of false positives can lead to inappropriate therapeutic management. Here, we present an LB assay composed of a proprietary error reduction algorithm designed to eliminate false positives due to PCR and NGS errors and a white blood cell sequencing (WBC-seq) component to detect and bioinformatically filter out CHIP-related mutations.<br \/>Consisting of a custom panel of 216 FDA\/NCCN pan-cancer genes, our cfDNA LB assay was analytically validated with commercially available reference standards and human cell lines. At a clinically relevant sequencing depth of 4000x, we observed a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.2% variant allele frequency for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions and deletions (indels) with overall accuracies of 98% and 99% and sensitivities of 91% and 83%, respectively. To assess the LB assay performance on clinical samples, orthogonal whole-exome sequencing (WES) with subsequent standard somatic variant calling was performed on paired peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and plasma samples from 12 patients. The WES assay results were concordant with those obtained using our LB assay for SNVs (CCC = 0.75) and indels (CCC = 0.90). Further, our assay detected an additional 53% and 50% SNVs and indels, respectively, compared to WES. Finally, 8 out of 11 clinically actionable mutations were detected by both WES and the LB assay, while 3 additional SNVs were detected in the LB assay.<br \/>Taken together, the use of WBC-seq to filter CHIP-derived mutations combined with our error reduction algorithm resulted in a substantial reduction in false positive variant calls without a compromise in the sensitivity or classification accuracy of SNVs and indels. Concordance was observed between traditional WES analysis and the LB assay developed here. These findings highlight the potential for our LB cfDNA assay to be used to improve personalized therapeutic options and guide clinical decision making.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Bioinformatics,ctDNA,Liquid biopsies,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anastasiya Yudina<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Alexey Efremov<sup><\/sup>, Danielle Sookiasian<sup><\/sup>, Ekaterina Nuzhdina<sup><\/sup>, Svetlana Podsvirova<sup><\/sup>, Madison Chasse<sup><\/sup>, Tori Conroy<sup><\/sup>, Noel English<sup><\/sup>, Sergey Starikov<sup><\/sup>, Olesia Klimchuk<sup><\/sup>, Dmitry Tabakov<sup><\/sup>, Anna Love<sup><\/sup>, Kushal Suryamohan<sup><\/sup>, Artur Baisangurov<sup><\/sup>, Cagdas Tazearslan<sup><\/sup>, Nathan Fowler<sup><\/sup>, Alexander Bagaev<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Bostongene, Corp., Waltham, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3d5b38b8-8685-4cbc-9492-e610dea85227","ControlNumber":"4878","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;A.

While tissue-agnostic, plasma-based copy number instability (CNI) has been demonstrated as an early indicator of response to immunotherapy for some solid tumors, it has not been assessed for patients with mPDAC, nor in combination with <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations for patients receiving standard of care chemo\/radiotherapy. Here we evaluate the combination of mutant <i>KRAS<\/i> (<i>mKRAS<\/i>) and CNI detection in plasma as a predictor of overall and progression-free survival (OS\/PFS) in mPDAC patients who received standard of care therapy.<br \/>Methods: Cell-free DNA was extracted from plasma and libraries prepared at baseline (Week 0) and weeks 8, 16 and 24 on therapy, and analyzed by next-generation sequencing (CNI) and droplet digital PCR (<i>mKRAS<\/i>). Descriptive statistics were computed for variables including CNI (score is a measure of circulating tumor DNA) and <i>mKRAS<\/i> variant allele fraction. Detection was defined as above the limit of detection (<i>mKRAS<\/i>=0.13%) and above the 95<sup>th<\/sup> percentile of the value in normal individuals (CNI=24). Therapy response was assessed by OS and PFS.<br \/>Results: 196 plasma samples from 64 mPDAC patients were analyzed. When dichotomized as detectable vs undetectable, CNI alone was significantly associated with OS at all on-therapy timepoints but not baseline, whereas <i>mKRAS<\/i> was significantly associated with OS for all 4 timepoints (Table 1). Detection of both CNI and <i>mKRAS<\/i> in combination was strongly associated with worse OS at all timepoints, yielding the highest HR. Similar results were obtained when <i>mKRAS<\/i> and CNI were dichotomized at their respective median values or with PFS as the clinical endpoint.<br \/>Conclusions: Combined CNI and <i>mKRAS<\/i> detection at baseline and on-therapy may provide a strong and early indication of worse prognosis for patients with mPDAC.<br \/><table border=\"1\"  cellpadding=\"1\" class=\"DisplayTable\" id=\"{3DF8021D-BC73-4415-AC40-82869FB57991}\"><caption>Table 1.

However, only a small percentage of patients benefit with ICI treatment over the long term, and precise biomarkers that can recognize these individuals before or early during treatment have so far eluded. PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden (TMB) are the most well studied biomarkers for predicting response to PD- (L)1 blockade-based ICI prior to treatment. TMB is still being clinically assessed whereas PD-L1 has several drawbacks for prediction of persistent benefit. Our aim is to evaluate the basal state and dynamic changes of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) concentration to predict and monitor response in NSCLC patients starting ICI. A total of 248 cfDNA concentration measurements were performed from 87 NSCLC patients. The quantification was done before the start of the treatment, at the second ICI cycle, after 6 and 12 months in treatment, and at progression if it was within the first 12 months. Quality and quantity of the cfDNA was assessed using Qubit High Sensitivity and Bioanalyzer 2100. We first explored the association with response of the basal cell-free DNA concentration using Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. The longitudinal analysis between different time points was tested with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Response was ascertained using RECIST parameters at 3, 6, and 12 months. We evaluated the utility of the cfDNA concentration as a prognostic factor using Mantel-Cox test. The response association results indicate that early and long-term response is associated with lower levels of basal cfDNA (p&#60;0.002, 3 months; p&#60;0.001, 6 months; p&#60;0.05, 12 months). The longitudinal analysis could also detect a decrease in cfDNA from the second cycle to the month 6 of treatment in responders (p&#60;0.05), and an increase in non-responders (p&#60;0.05). To identify a prognostic concentration threshold, statistical stratification of cfDNA levels based on the selected maximum rank method of cfDNA levels was used to group them into low and high concentration. Patients with high basal cfDNA concentrations showed both worse FPS (log-rank 3.4x10<sup>-03<\/sup>, Medians: Low 12.57 [8.36 - 18.46] High 5.50 [3.03 - 10.06]) and OS (log-rank 3.2x10<sup>-05<\/sup>, Medians: Low 21.26 [15.33 - 33.96] High 5.45 [3.10 - 15.66]). With these results, we provide proof-of-principle that specifically detecting tumor cfDNA by PCR or NGS methods would not be necessary to predict the long-term clinical benefit to ICI in NSCLC patients. Moreover, concentration cut-offs can be defined to categorize the patients in potential responders and non-responders before the start of the treatment. This would constitute a cost-effective and easily implementable prognostic tool that could be particularly useful for avoiding loss of treatment windows of opportunities.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell-free DNA,NSCLC,Survival,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Isabel Barragan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Elisabeth Perez-Ruiz<sup>2<\/sup>, Juan Luis Onieva<sup>3<\/sup>, Maria Garrido-Ramos<sup>3<\/sup>, Beatriz Martinez-Galvez<sup>2<\/sup>, Jaime Dubbelman<sup>2<\/sup>, Emilio Alba<sup>4<\/sup>, Juan Zafra<sup>3<\/sup>, Manuel Cobo<sup>2<\/sup>, Javier Oliver<sup>2<\/sup>, Antonio Rueda-Dominguez<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Group of Pharmacoepigenetics, Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Karolinska Institute, Tomte, Medical Oncology Intercenter Unit, Group of Translational Research in Cancer Immunotherapy, Regional and Virgen de la Victoria University Hospitals, Instituto de Investigación Biomédica de Málaga y Plataforma en Nanomedicina-IBIMA Plataforma BIONAND, Malaga, Spain,<sup>2<\/sup>Medical Oncology Intercenter Unit, Group of Translational Research in Cancer Immunotherapy, Regional and Virgen de la Victoria University Hospitals, Instituto de Investigación Biomédica de Málaga y Plataforma en Nanomedicina-IBIMA Plataforma BIONAND, Malaga, Spain,<sup>3<\/sup>Facultad de Medicina, Campus de Teatinos s\/n, Universidad de Málaga, 29071 Malaga, Spain, Medical Oncology Intercenter Unit, Group of Translational Research in Cancer Immunotherapy, Regional and Virgen de la Victoria University Hospitals, Instituto de Investigación Biomédica de Málaga y Plataforma en Nanomedicina-IBIMA Plataforma BIONAND, Malaga, Spain,<sup>4<\/sup>Medical Oncology Intercenter Unit, Regional and Virgen de la Victoria University Hospitals, Instituto de Investigación Biomédica de Málaga y Plataforma en Nanomedicina-IBIMA Plataforma BIONAND, 29010 Málaga, Spain, Malaga, Spain","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"77808d2e-cefd-4e43-8923-fac2ac847c85","ControlNumber":"6613","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>I.

This is particularly important for tracking minimal residual disease (MRD), since alterations erroneously considered to be tumor derived may lead to false detection. Use of blood leukocytes as a germline control is critical not only for appropriate censoring of constitutional allelic variants, but also for addressing those associated with clonal hematopoiesis (CH). However, such matched germline is not always available, or may be suboptimal when contaminated with tumor cells. We hypothesized that accurate tumor genotyping might be feasible without a matched germline, using a dedicated algorithmic framework relying on clonal relationships of alleles of interest (i.e., phylons).<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Here, we introduce RePhyNER (Recursive Phylon Nomination, Enumeration, and Recovery), an algorithm for addressing this challenge in serial liquid biopsies. RePhyNER relies on the assumption that when comparing two specimens from the same individual (e.g., before and after therapy), the genomic variants of interests (e.g., tumor somatic mutations) behave differently in their allelic levels when compared to variants needing to be censored (e.g., germline constitutional alleles or CH). Using the change in mean allelic level of all variants in &#8805;2 samples, RePhyNER relies on a recursive approach to test each candidate somatic variant&#8217;s corresponding change gradient against this distribution using count-based statistics.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>: We used simulations to assess the importance of multiple parameters including fraction of contaminating variants or alleles and mean allelic fold-change. These simulations showed substantially superior performance of a recursive approach and revealed that for &#8805;2-fold changes in the mean VAF in a pair of samples, RePhyNER accurately removed &#62;99% of contaminating alleles while preserving ~100% of true variants. We then applied RePhyNER to 108 plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from 47 patients with classic Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) profiled by PhasED-Seq and compared MRD-detection performance with or without matched germline. RePhyNER substantially improved specificity by ~30% (68% vs 99%), and Precision by ~50% (46% vs 96%), while only modestly reducing sensitivity (100% vs 91%). We next applied PhasED-Seq to a cohort of cHL patients (n=65) without matched germline information. MRD positivity within the first 2 cycles of therapy was associated with inferior outcome when using RePhyNER (P&#60;0.05 vs ns), correctly reclassifying 26% of detected patients to undetected.<b> <\/b><br \/><b>Conclusions<\/b>: RePhyNER enables germline-free and accurate genotyping for MRD detection. Notably, RePhyNER obviates the need for additional germline profiling overcoming key limitations described above and avoids the additional associated costs of sequencing.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"cfDNA,Liquid biopsies,Hodgkin's lymphoma,ctDNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Mohammad Shahrokh Esfahani<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Stefan Alig<sup><\/sup>, Emily Hamilton<sup><\/sup>, Joseph Schroers-Martin<sup><\/sup>, Brian Sworder<sup><\/sup>, Jan Boegeholz<sup><\/sup>, Mari Olsen<sup><\/sup>, Chih Long Liu<sup><\/sup>, David Kurtz<sup><\/sup>, Maximilian Diehn<sup><\/sup>, Ash Alizadeh<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"8a459f5d-cd60-47dd-b172-fe87495e4fbc","ControlNumber":"7844","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;M.

Evaluation of treatment effect can be difficult as pseudo progression is seen in approximately 15% of patients. Hence, effective treatment can be stopped prematurely and no approved or standard second line treatment exist. Genomic alterations during treatment can cause treatment resistance and treatment failure. In order to investigate the genomic alterations, consecutive tissue samples are wanted. However, this is often not possible due to risk doing surgery. Therefore, liquid biopsies from plasma, containing circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and circulating cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) might be an alternative. Based on findings by our group, we aim to improve treatment evaluation and suggest targeted treatment possibilities by investigating the role of cfDNA and ctDNA in a large prospective cohort, included from a neurooncological out-patient clinic.<br \/>Materials and Methods: Newly diagnosed patients with GBM, a performance status of 0-1 and planned for concurrent chemo\/radiation will be eligible. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) will be done on tissue. Peripheral blood will be collected in cell stabilizing Blood Collection Tubes (STRECK) and cfDNA quantified on a Qubit Fluorometer. Samples will be collected before the concurrent treatment and at fixed time points until progression with a total of 8-10 samples per patient. For the ctDNA analyses, a patient specific tumor mutation will be selected based upon WGS from tumor tissue. The identified mutation will be quantified in plasma (ctDNA) by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Dual labeled fluorescent probes for the mutation and the wild type loci will be used and PCR reaction mixtures will be run. Mutant allele fractions (AFs) &#8805;0.001 (0.1%) will be detected. An increase in ctDNA AF will be recorded if the AF increases from non-detectable to detectable levels (AF &#8805; 0.001) or increases in two consecutive samples.<br \/>Results: Inclusion began in June 2022 and by time of abstract deadline, we have 27 patients included. Of these, 16 have completed the concurrent setting with a total of five samples per patient. One patient has died and two have progressed. Hence, 24 patients are still on-treatment and sampling and accrual will continue. The first analyses for cfDNA will be run in the winter of 2022\/2023 and results will be presented at the conference.

To improve the prognosis of PANC, it is necessary to develop tools that will enable earlier diagnosis. More than 90% of PANC cases are characterized by the presence of <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations in tumor tissue that play a critical role in the initiation of PANC. Recently, attention has been focused on liquid biopsy which can better reflect the whole genetic profile of the tumor and may enable early diagnosis.<br \/>Our study aims to discover whether <i>KRAS <\/i>gene mutations can be detected in the plasma isolated from the PANC risk group patients - diabetes mellitus II (DMII) and chronic pancreatitis (CP). The <i>KRAS<\/i> mutations were analyzed in 34 PANC, 89 DMII, and 31 CP patients by droplet digital PCR. Plasma cell-free DNA was investigated for three mutations hotspots: <i>KRAS<\/i> p.G12D c.35G&#62;A,<i> <\/i>p.G12V c.35G&#62;T,<i> <\/i>p.G12R.

The most frequently mutated genes include EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, HER2, PIK3CA, MET, etc. Unfortunately, screening and monitoring the most common cancer related mutations and identifying the breadth of the most common drug-resistant mutations in MRD monitoring has previously required NGS - but cost, and time for execution, limits testing frequency. Furthermore, sensitivity is typically 1-5% VAF, thus limiting early detection. While digital PCR (dPCR) can be run at a fraction of the cost, and with higher sensitivity (VAFs of 0.1 to 0.01%), due to the lack of high level of multiplexing, it was historically impractical for routine screening. Here, we show that the use 6-color naica&#174; system (Stilla Technologies), incorporating a series of high multiplex panels developed by Atila BioSystems, is able to group and efficiently detect the most frequently druggable mutations in a single reaction within three hours.

When CRC is identified early, there is a five-year survival rate of about 90% but it drops to near 12% once there are distant metastases. Early detection of colorectal adenoma is warranted as it represents the precancerous lesion of CRC. The removal of colorectal adenoma can effectively prevent the subsequent development of CRC. The only preventive strategy is to undergo appropriate endoscopic surveillance and early detection of adenoma or CRC In this study, we focused on the transcriptome profile in patients with colon adenomas, incident colorectal cancer (CRC) and in the healthy population. MRNA transcripts were, in addition to tissues, isolated from the plasma and stool. Plasma and stool analyses should reveal potential mRNA signatures capable of non-invasive determination of the average individual risk of predisposition to adenomas or CRCs. Relevant plasma\/stool mRNA will be further validated in another group of individuals with similar clinical characteristics and analyzed in relation to diet and lifestyle factors. For patients with CRC, plasma and stool specimens are collected repeatedly to reveal whether the transcripts identified by us will decrease or diminish in CRC patients after successful surgery. We hypothesize that altered mRNA signatures in plasma and stool may serve as a robust, powerful non-invasive and sufficiently sensitive tool in the early detection of adenomas or CRCs. The bioinformatic analysis is currently running and the results will be presented during the meeting. The long-term significance of the project lays on improvement of the therapy efficacy in colon cancer patients.

Detection prior to metastasis and appropriate therapeutic application lead to greater patient survival and quality of life. However, the diagnosis and postoperative surveillance are surrounded by limitations. Genetic biomarkers are influential factors that contribute to favorable clinical outcomes. To better understand the molecular basis associated with CRC, we investigated KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, EGFR and TP53 genes in the DNA of tumor and healthy cells using Sanger sequencing. The most frequent alteration, present only in the tumor DNA (somatic), was used to investigate, by Digital PCR (ddPCR), the detection and analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the plasma. Altogether, 42 subjects made up the study, most of them male (59.5%), with a mean age of 63 years and tumors located in the right colon (21.4%). transversal (2.4%), left (4.8%), sigmoid (33.3%) and straight (38.1%). Germline and somatic allelic variants were found in the KRAS, EGFR and TP53 genes. The most frequent somatic alteration in the study was rs121913529, which showed an association with alcohol consumption (p = 0.002). Patients with a somatic mutation in TP53 are ten times more likely to die, compared with the chance of those without a mutation in this gene (OR 11.2; 95% CI 1.25 - 245). The applicability of these somatic changes in the liquid biopsy technique was demonstrated by ddPCR.

MR is predictive of long-term outcomes in several advanced cancers treated with different therapeutic modalities. Common MR thresholds include reductions in &#8805;50%, or 100% (clearance) in ctDNA levels. A better understanding of the background variability in measured plasma ctDNA levels in the absence of therapy is required to enable improved interpretation of MR, especially as its use increases in drug development and clinical management.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>In the largest study of double baseline pre-treatment ctDNA samples reported to date, paired screening and pre-treatment cycle 1 day 1 (C1D1) samples (IQR: 8-24, median 17 days apart) from 360 patients with advanced EGFRm non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from the FLAURA (1L, N=132) and AURA3 (2L, N=228) trials were compared to characterize background variability in ctDNA. ctDNA was quantified using NGS (Guardant Health G360 and OMNI) and ddPCR (Biodesix) assays. Various potential drivers of background variability, such as ctDNA quantification platforms, coverage, and number of variants at baseline were evaluated to better understand any underlying confounding effects.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Pre-treatment background variability was consistently observed in both AURA3 and FLAURA cohorts. Most of the variability reflected any increase in pre-treatment ctDNA in 28% (64\/228) of cases in AURA3, and 13% (17\/132) of cases in FLAURA. Variability reflecting a &#8805;50% decrease in pre-treatment ctDNA was observed in 8% (18\/228) of cases in AURA3 and 9% (12\/132) of cases in FLAURA, with only 2% of cases showing ctDNA clearance in AURA3 and 0% in FLAURA. Testing technical replicates sequenced a year apart and comparing ctDNA levels quantified with NGS v. ddPCR for potential sources of technical variability did not show large variability. Moreover, sources like cell-free DNA input, allele frequency levels, and days in between screening and C1D1 were tested but could not fully account for the variability observed.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Although pre-treatment increases in ctDNA levels were expected in patients with advanced cancer, background variability also included reductions in ctDNA that may be confounded as MR. Understanding the impact of factors on the transient nature of ctDNA is key, but as momentum mounts to use ctDNA as a biomarker of therapeutic response, it is crucial to test and account for background variability rates to improve MR interpretability. Additional work is warranted to elucidate the background variability rate in other cancer types and settings.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,Liquid biopsies,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Diana M.

Liquid biopsy provides a noninvasive window into the cancer genome and the underlying biology of the tumor. Circulating-tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a versatile analyte for tumor diagnosis, monitoring treatment response, detecting resistance, and tracking tumor evolution. The central hypothesis of our work is that detection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ctDNA correlates with clinically significant events and can be used as a surrogate for tissue biopsy to guide treatment decisions in the clinic.<br \/>Methods:<br \/>Our study includes CSF ctDNA samples from 140 recurrent glioma patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who underwent collection of CSF as part of their clinical evaluation for neurological signs and symptoms. For each patient, glioma subtype and grade were confirmed by a neuropathologist. Overall survival was calculated as the time interval between the date of diagnosis and the date of death. All samples were sequenced using the MSK-IMPACT targeted sequencing assay (468 genes). Allele-specific copy number calls were assessed using the FACETS algorithm. Mutations were classified as drivers based on OncoKB. To evaluate the relationship between CSF ctDNA detection and clinico-pathologic correlates, CSF ctDNA status was determined positive by the presence of at least one somatic mutation and CSF ctDNA status was correlated with clinico-pathologic features.<br \/>Results:<br \/>Within this cohort, we found 68 CSF ctDNA positive and 72 CSF negative samples. The most frequently mutated genes were: <i>TERT <\/i>(58.2%), <i>TP53 <\/i>(47.8%), <i>IDH1 <\/i>(20.9%) and <i>EGFR <\/i>(26.9%). We observed a concordance between contemporaneously sampled tumor and CSF. In a multivariate analysis accounting for established prognostic factors including: % extent of resection at diagnosis; tumor burden at the time of lumbar puncture; and IDH status, we found that CSF ctDNA positivity was negatively correlated with overall survival (HR: 2.52, p &#60;0.0001). Patients with CSF positive samples had an overall survival of 3.35 months vs 11.91 months for those with CSF negative samples (p &#60; 0.0001).<br \/>Conclusion:<br \/>ctDNA from CSF depicts a powerful analyte with the potential to alter the standard of care. We have established a robust liquid biopsy program across the neuro-oncology department at MSK, and MSK-IMPACT is now certified by NYS DOH for use on CSF ctDNA enabling routine integration into clinical care. In summary, we are now able to monitor the changing genome along the disease course and have the potential to detect disease occurrence at an earlier time point, however further validation of CSF ctDNA for disease monitoring is needed. Additionally, our data suggests that CSF ctDNA may be used as a prognostic biomarker for survival, but confirmation requires further validation in a prospective study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Glioma,Genomics,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Subhiksha Nandakumar<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Christoph Kreitzer<sup><\/sup>, Charli Ann J.
