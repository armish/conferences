Small molecule inhibitors of DDR proteins have been developed to target these cancers, which are now FDA-approved and\/or currently being tested in clinical trials. Our team recently reported on an entirely new approach to exploit DDR defects in cancer, via DNA modification, eliminating the need to target proteins (Lin <i>et al.<\/i>, <i>Science<\/i> 2022). In this recent study, we demonstrated that our new class of &#8220;DNA modifiers (DMs)&#8221; can be engineered to exploit loss of O6-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT), which leads to robust and selective killing of MGMT-deficient glioma tumors, both <i>in vivo<\/i> and <i>in vitro<\/i>. We also found that our approach could overcome acquired and intrinsic defects in another DDR pathway, mismatch repair (MMR), which is a known resistance mechanism to standard-of-care cytotoxic therapies in glioma, including TMZ.<br \/>Here, we sought to determine the extent to which our approach can be expanded to selectively target a wide range of cancers beyond glioma in which loss of MGMT, as well as acquired and intrinsic MMR defect, are commonly seen at various frequencies. To this end, we profiled over 900 cell line models, as well as several collections of patient-derived cultures derived from several tumor types for sensitivity to our DMs based on MGMT and MMR status <i>in vitro<\/i>. We then validated our findings in cell line xenograft and patient-derived xenograft models, <i>in vivo<\/i>. In parallel, we compared the activity of DMs to commonly used, standard-of-care cytotoxic drugs, <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Our data indicate that DMs can effectively target MGMT loss, as well as intrinsic and acquired MMR defects, in multiple non-CNS tumor types. Taken together, the findings reported here support an entirely new approach to selectively exploit DDR defects via direct DNA modification. This new approach has the potential to overcome known resistance mechanisms to currently used small molecule inhibitors of DDR proteins, across a broad range of cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-02 Biochemical modulators of the therapeutic index,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"DNA damage response,MGMT,Mismatch repair,Glioma,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Bruce Ruggeri<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Kyle Tarantino<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ranjini Sundaram<sup>2<\/sup>, Kingson Lin<sup>2<\/sup>, Seth Herzon<sup>3<\/sup>, Joseph Park<sup>1<\/sup>, Spenser Johnson<sup>2<\/sup>, Susan Gueble<sup>2<\/sup>, Ranjit  S.

B7-H4 is over expressed in breast and ovarian cancer compared to normal tissues making it a promising target for therapies, however, to date it has not been evaluated if the expression is maintained in drug resistant cancer. Here we examine B7-H4 expression in high grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) tumors at diagnosis and post-platinum or PARPi-resistance. We also evaluate the activity of a novel B7-H4-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) bearing the pyrrolobenzodiazepine-dimer payload tesirine, in preclinical models of breast and ovarian cancer, including those resistant to standard of care therapies.<br \/>Experimental Design: B7-H4 expression was measured by quantitative flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. ADC efficacy was tested against multiple cell lines <i>in vitro<\/i> and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) <i>in vivo<\/i>. The effect of ADC treatment on cell cycle, DNA damage, and apoptosis was measured using flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: B7-H4 was over-expressed in 92% of HGSOC tumors at diagnosis (<i>n = <\/i>12), persisted in recurrent matched samples after platinum treatment, and was expressed at similar levels at multiple metastatic sites after acquired multi-drug resistance (<i>n = <\/i>4 donors). Treatment with the ADC resulted in target-specific growth inhibition in a panel of ten B7-H4 expressing ovarian and breast cancer cell lines (IC<sub>50<\/sub> 6.18-273.9 pM, median 48.3 pM). Co-cultures of B7-H4 +\/- lines support bystander killing effects leading to further tumor cell death in B7-H4- clones. In platinum- or PARPi-resistant ovarian cancer cells, ADC treatment significantly decreased viability and colony formation (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.001) while increasing S or G2\/M phase cell cycle arrest (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.001) and DNA damage (<i>P <\/i>&#60; 0.0001), ultimately leading to apoptosis (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.01). A single 0.3 mg\/kg dose of the ADC resulted in tumor regression in 61% of breast and ovarian PDX models tested (<i>n<\/i> = 23), where lower activity was identified in B7-H4 low or negative expressing models (<i>P <\/i>= 0.048). In PARPi- and platinum-resistant HGSOC models (<i>n<\/i> = 3), continuous B7-H4 ADC treatment (dosed once every 28 days) resulted in sustained anti-tumor activity, leading to complete (7 of 16) or partial responses (3 of 16) and increased survival (<i>P<\/i> &#60; 0.004).<br \/>Conclusions: These data support B7-H4 as an attractive ADC target for treatment of drug-resistant HGSOC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),B7-H4,Drug Resistance,Breast Cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sarah B.

As such, Podxl is emerging as an important prognostic and theragnostic marker. While Podxl is expressed on normal vascular endothelia and kidney podocytes, we sought to produce a novel anti-Podxl antibody that selectively recognizes a tumor-restricted glycoepitope on the extracellular mucin domain of Podxl. The antibody we have produced, PODO447, is specific to the tumor glycoform of Podxl, demonstrated by a lack of binding to normal tissues that are known to express Podxl. In contrast, we show binding of the antibody to tumor cell lines, patient-derived cell lines, and primary tumor tissues. We have previously shown that the majority of tumors in an ovarian carcinoma array (219 cases), including 65% of the high-grade serous histotype, are positive for PODO447. Here, we further show the presence of PODO447 in tumors of the breast, urothelium, pancreas, endometrium, colon, prostate, lung (both small cell and non-small cell), and glioblastoma. To assess the therapeutic potential of our antibody as an antibody drug conjugate (ADC), we coupled PODO447 to the microtubule disruptor monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) with an enzyme cleavable linker carbamoyl p-aminobenzyl carbamate (PABC), resulting in the ADC PODO447-Vedotin. We demonstrate promising <i>in<\/i> <i>vitro<\/i> activity of the ADC to various human tumor cell lines as well as <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy to xenografted ovarian and pancreatic tumor lines. Our data reveals PODO447-Vedotin as a tumor-specific and highly efficacious therapeutic agent for the targeting of human tumors and as such, PODO447 exhibits potential for further development as a targeted clinical immunotherapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-01 Antibody technologies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),Molecular targets,Glycosylation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Pamela M.

Exp. Med). We hypothesized that RvE1 shifts the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) to an immunogenic state, thus offering combination potential with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in ICI-resistant and ICI-sensitive tumors.<br \/>Methods: Subcutaneous murine models of lung (LLC), melanoma (B16F10), and pancreatic (Panc02; KPC) tumors were used to investigate TP-317 monotherapy and combinations with ICI. Treatment was initiated when tumors reached 125-240 mm<sup>3<\/sup>.<br \/>Results: In the LLC model (N=5\/group), TP317 (0.75 &#181;g QD) inhibited tumor growth (1419 &#177; 266 mm<sup>3<\/sup>) compared to placebo (2348 &#177; 542 mm<sup>3<\/sup>; p=0.068) and anti-PD1 (200 &#181;g IP, Q3D; 3015 &#177; 730; p=0.078). TP317 + anti-PD1 dual therapy was superior to placebo and anti-PD1 alone (893 &#177; 166 mm<sup>3<\/sup>; p&#60;0.05). In the B16F10 model (N=8\/group), TP317 (7.5 &#181;g Q6D) was efficacious compared to placebo (787 &#177; 367 vs 1964 &#177; 208 mm<sup>3<\/sup>; p&#60;0.01) and comparable to the ICI dual therapy of anti-PD1 + anti-CTLA4 (100 &#181;g 1st dose, 200 &#181;g IP Q3D up to 4 doses). Triple therapy with TP317 + anti-PD1 + anti-CTLA4 was superior to ICI dual therapy (340 &#177; 91 vs 757 &#177; 260 mm<sup>3<\/sup>; p&#60;0.05). In the Panc02 model (N=8\/group), TP317 (0.75 &#181;g Q7D) was efficacious compared to placebo (1148 &#177; 178 vs 1992 &#177;165 mm<sup>3<\/sup>; p&#60;0.001) and comparable to anti-PD1. TP317 + anti-PD1 dual therapy demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity compared to anti-PD1 alone (329 &#177; 72 vs 1446 &#177; 305 mm<sup>3<\/sup>; p&#60;0.01). In KRAS-mutant KPC tumors (N=10\/group), TP317 (7.5 &#181;g Q6D) demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity compared to placebo (500 &#177; 110 vs 1314 &#177; 106 mm<sup>3<\/sup>; p&#60;0.001) and was comparable to anti-PD1, while TP-317 + anti-PD1 was superior to anti-PD1 alone (353 &#177; 82 vs 710 &#177; 106 mm<sup>3<\/sup>; p&#60;0.01). In Panc02 and KPC models, TP317&#8217;s anti-tumor efficacy was attenuated by CD8+ T cell or NK cell depletion. Consistent with the depletion study results, RNAseq analysis with cell-type deconvolution showed that TP317 enhanced CD8 and NK cell associated programs in Panc02 and B16F10 tumors, and also promoted macrophage, dendritic cell, B cell and antigen presentation functions in the TME.<br \/>Conclusions: TP317 monotherapy and ICI combinations significantly inhibited tumor growth in various murine models of cancer. The effects on various immune cell functions and the surprising efficacy of short half-life RvE1 (&#60;2 hours) dosed weekly suggests that TP317 is reprogramming the TME to an immunogenic state.

Functionally, DHX9&#8217;s role involves binding to as well as unwinding and\/or resolving double-stranded and single-stranded DNA\/RNA, DNA\/RNA hybrids (R-loops), circular RNA and DNA\/RNA G quadraplexes. Overexpression of DHX9 is evident in multiple cancer types, including colorectal cancer (CRC) and lung cancer. In addition, microsatellite instable (MSI) tumors exhibiting defective mismatch repair (dMMR) show a strong dependence on DHX9, making this helicase an attractive target for oncology drug discovery.<br \/>Here we describe data supporting targeting DHX9 in MSI CRC as a novel therapeutic, and the first identification of potent and selective <i>in vitro <\/i>and <i>in vivo <\/i>small molecule inhibitors of DHX9. We demonstrate that DHX9 inhibition in MSI CRC, delivered either through siRNA knockdown or compound treatment, leads to an increase in RNA\/DNA secondary structures such as R-loops and circRNA (i.e. circBRIP1) inducing replication stress. Cell lines that are dMMR (i.e. MSI) are unable to resolve this replication stress, resulting in prevention of DNA replication in S phase and later onset of apoptosis. We were able to confirm this selective dependency in a panel of 20 CRC cell lines; anti-proliferative effects mediated by DHX9 inhibition were dependent on cell line dMMR status in a 10-day proliferation assay. Furthermore, compound 1, an orally bioavailable DHX9 inhibitor was used to investigate <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy in MSI CRC (LS411N) and MSS CRC (SW480) xenograft models. Compound 1 was well tolerated across the 28-day treatment period with robust and durable tumor regression (TGI = 105 %) observed in the LS411N tumor xenograft model only. In addition, following cessation of treatment, minimal tumor regrowth was observed in a 28-day post treatment window. Tumor and plasma concentrations of compound 1 and changes in pharmacodynamic markers of DHX9 inhibition, such as circBRIP1 mRNA, were measured and resulting PK and PD data were highly correlated. Together, these preclinical data validate DHX9 as a tractable new target with potential utility as a novel treatment for patients with MSI CRC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Drug discovery,Microsatellite instability,Mismatch repair deficiency,RNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jennifer Castro<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Matthew  H.

Mammalian SWI\/SNF complexes always contain one of two mutually exclusive and structurally highly related ATPases: SMARCA2\/BRM or SMARCA4\/BRG1, as its catalytic subunit, which hydrolyze ATP to drive nucleosome movement. It is reported that absence of SMARCA4 are present in several cancers and these SMARCA4 deficient cells highly depend on its paralog SMARCA2 for survival. Furthermore, concurrent inhibition of SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 is fatal to normal cells. Therefore, it holds great therapeutic promise to treat SMARCA4 deficient cancers with selective SMARCA2 degraders while leaving SMARCA4 wild type cells unaffected. Here, we report that SCR-9140 is a high selective SMARCA2 degrader which demonstrates superior anti-tumor activity and low cytotoxicity against non-malignant cells. SCR-9140 strongly degrades SMARCA2 with DC<sub>50<\/sub> of &#60;1 nM and achieves the complete protein degradation (D<sub>max<\/sub> of &#62;95%) and also shows 100-fold degradation selectivity over SMARCA4 with DC<sub>50<\/sub> of around 100 nM and D<sub>max<\/sub> of &#60;60% in HiBiT knock-in SW1573 cells. Across a panel of SMARCA4 deficient tumor cell lines, SCR-9140 potently inhibits proliferation with IC<sub>50<\/sub> values ranging from 1 to 50 nM. Due to the high selectivity over SMARCA4, SCR-9140 neither inhibits proliferation of SW1573 (SMARCA2-WT SMARCA4-WT) cells nor NCI-H1581 (SMARCA2-DEL SMARCA4-DEL) cells with IC<sub>50<\/sub>s of over 2000 nM. The degraders with poor selectivity of SMARCA2\/4 (DC<sub>50<\/sub> ratio: &#60; 10 folds, D<sub>max<\/sub> of SMARCA4 &#62; 80%) strongly inhibit the SW1573 cells proliferation with IC<sub>50<\/sub>s &#60; 100nM, while there are no significant effects on the NCI-H1581 cells ascribing to the absence of targets. Furthermore, SCR-9140 demonstrates weak cytotoxicity on non-malignant cells, such as WI-38 (human lung fibroblast cells), THLE-2 (human liver cells), and human PBMC, rendering it the greater therapeutic window. In a CDX model of NSCLC, SCR-9140 effectively inhibits tumor growth and TGI correlates well with SMARCA2 degradation in tumors. In conclusion, our potent and selective SMARCA2 degrader, SCR-9140 induces strong synthetic lethality in SMARCA4 deficient cells <i>in vitro<\/i> and<i> in vivo<\/i> and shows great safety margin in normal cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Transcriptional regulation,SWI\/SNF,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Feng Zhou<sup>1<\/sup>, Zhiyong Yu<sup>2<\/sup>, Ruonan Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Feng Tang<sup>1<\/sup>, Peng Gu<sup>1<\/sup>, Wenqing Yang<sup>1<\/sup>, Liting Xue<sup>1<\/sup>, Ping Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Renhong Tang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>State Key Laboratory of Translational Medicine and Innovative Drug Development, Jiangsu Simcere Pharmaceuticals Co.

Despite recent advances, the majority of patients with lung cancer still lack effective therapeutic options, underscoring the dire need for additional treatment approaches. Genomic studies have identified frequent mutations in subunits of the SWI\/SNF chromatin remodeling complex including <i>SMARCA4<\/i> and <i>ARID1A<\/i> in non-small cell lung cancer with a frequency of up to 33% in advanced stage disease, making it the most frequently mutated complex in lung cancer. Recent reports, and our own data, have identified the paralogue <i>SMARCA2<\/i> to be synthetic lethal to <i>SMARCA4 <\/i>suggesting SMARCA2 is a valuable therapeutic target<i>. <\/i>However, the discovery of selective inhibitors of SMARCA2 has been challenging. To overcome this hurdle, we have utilized iterative structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies to develop novel, potent and selective SMARCA2 degrading small molecules based on proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology. We demonstrated that YD23, our lead SMARCA2 PROTAC, potently and selectively induces degradation of SMARCA2. Using global proteomic analysis and quantification of more than 8000 proteins, we showed that our SMARCA2 PROTAC is highly selective for SMARCA2. Importantly, we showed that YD23 selectively inhibits growth of <i>SMARCA4<\/i> mutant lung cancer cells in vitro. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that YD23 reduces chromatin accessibility only in <i>SMARCA4<\/i> deficient cells. In particular, YD23 profoundly decreased chromatin accessibility at enhancers of a number of genes including cell cycle and cell growth regulatory genes. Gene expression profiling and pathway analysis indicated that various cell cycle genes were downregulated by YD23 consistent with the reduced chromatin accessibility at their regulatory regions. In conclusion, our study provides a potent chemical probe for studying the synthetic lethal interaction between SMARCA2 and SMARCA4, dissect the chromatin and epigenetic landscape alterations and lay the foundation for future preclinical and clinical development of SMARCA2 degraders as therapeutics.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++ET02-05 New targets,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Epigenetics,SWI\/SNF,PROTAC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Sasi Kotagiri<sup><\/sup>, Nicholas Blazanin<sup><\/sup>, Yuanxin Xi<sup><\/sup>, Jing Wang<sup><\/sup>, <b>Yonathan Lissanu<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"bed5d07a-ee7a-4d45-aa60-f1535f464937","ControlNumber":"2114","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.
