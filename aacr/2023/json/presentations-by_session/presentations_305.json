[{"Abstract":"Background: The detection of circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) has been examined as a predictor of postoperative recurrence and survival in lung cancer patients. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have potent for searching a new target to cancers.<br \/>Objective: To analyze the association between cfDNA\/EVs and prognosis after lung cancer surgery.<br \/>Methods: We retrospectively examined patient background, disease-free survival, overall survival, and preoperative cfDNA in lung cancer patients who underwent surgery at Kanazawa University Hospital between January 2017 and May 2020, in whom preoperative chemotherapy was not administered. We extracted cfDNA from 4 ml plasma within 7 days before surgery and measured its concentration. EVs were extracted from 500 &#956;l serum via Tim4 protein. Proteins included in EVs were analyzed by mass spectrometry.<br \/>Results: 285 patients were included, 179 males and 106 females, median age 71(36-88) years, and 8 patients had SCLC. EGFRm- positive lung cancer was included in 93 cases (32.6%). The pStage0\/l\/ll\/lll\/lV of NSCLC was 7\/187\/42\/36\/6 respectively, and the pStagel\/ll\/lll of SCLC was 4\/1\/3 respectively. The mDFS of NSCLC was 14.6 (7.8-29.7)\/21.5 (8.5-NA) months in pStage lll\/lV, respectively. mOS was 53.3 (28.7-NA) months in pStage lll and was not achieved in other stages. The mDFS of SCLC was 19.8 (1.9-NA)\/NA\/5.7 (1.9-NA) months in pStage l\/ll\/lll, respectively. mOS was NA\/NA\/9.3 (9.3-NA) months, respectively. cfDNA was detected in 283 (99.2%) patients, with a concentration of 4.7 (0-60.0) ng\/&#956;l. The correlation coefficient between cfDNA concentration and DFS\/OS in NSCLC was -0.023 (P=0.70)\/-0.014 (P=0.81). The correlation coefficient between cfDNA concentration and DFS\/OS for SCLC was -0.86 (P=0.024)\/-0.89 (P=0.012). No recurrence was observed in patients in whom cfDNA was not detected.EVs were detectable from pre-operative serum samples, and the proteins included in these were different, whether disease was recurrent or not.<br \/>Conclusion: The cfDNA concentration did not correlate with DFS\/OS in post-operative NSCLC, whereas it correlated negatively with DFS\/OS in SCLC. In the presentation, we will further discuss about the concrete genetic alterations and protein expression, based on the cfDNA sequencing and proteomics analysis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-06 Liquid biopsy: Multi-analyte and multi-omic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cell-free DNA,Extracellular vesicles,Lung cancer,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hayato Koba<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Hideharu Kimura<sup><\/sup>, Seiji Yano<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Kanazawa Univ.

Although the all-stage 5-year survival rate is ~10%, early-stage 5-year survival is markedly superior and in excess of 40%. Hence, early detection of PDAC via blood-based liquid biopsies holds promise to reduce morbidity and mortality. PrognomiQ&#8217;s multi-omics platform performs deep and unbiased molecular profiling of blood samples to detect proteins, metabolites, lipids, mRNA, miRNA, cfDNA fragmentation and copy-number, and CpG methylation. Here we report results from training and validation of a classifier on a subset of that multi-omic data with the potential to enable the development of high sensitivity and specificity tests for early detection of PDAC.We conducted a case-control study comprising 146 subjects across 16 clinical sites, including 63 pathology-confirmed, untreated PDAC cases (12 stage I, 8 stage II, 4 stage III, 36 stage IV, and 3 stage unknown) and 83 age- and gender- matched controls without any known cancer. For each subject, venous blood samples including plasma were collected. Unbiased LCMS was used to detect and quantify proteins, and targeted, multiplexed MRM-LCMS assays were used for both metabolites and lipids. After data processing, we detected 54,114 proteomic features, 898 lipids, and 373 metabolites. 445 proteomic features, 170 lipids, and 37 metabolites were found to be significantly different as determined by Bonferroni-corrected Wilcoxon tests with FWER <u>&#60;<\/u> 0.05. For classification, the dataset was split into training (37 cases and 37 controls) and validation (26 cases and 46 controls) sets, with control for collection site and date, age, and gender. XGBoost models were constructed for each analyte class using ten repeats of 10-fold cross-validation. To improve specificity to PDAC, all proteomic features which mapped to GOBP terms associated with acute-phase response, inflammation, and immune response were excluded prior to training. The best-performing hyperparameters were used for a final model built on the full training set and then used for inference on the validation set. At 99% specificity, the proteomic classifier had sensitivities of 77%, 57%, and 88% for Stages 1-4, Stages 1-2, and Stages 3-4, respectively, estimated by bootstrap re-sampling of the validation results. Metabolomics had sensitivities of 81%, 71%, and 88%. Lipidomics had sensitivities of 65%, 71%, and 65%. A joint, multi-omic model was constructed by averaging the scaled probabilities of all models. This joint model improved performance at 99% specificity with sensitivities of 92%, 86%, and 94%, highlighting the synergy of multi-omics data, particularly phenotypically related omics such as those described here. Multi-omic classifiers such as these can serve as the foundation for blood-based liquid biopsies for the early detection of PDAC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-06 Liquid biopsy: Multi-analyte and multi-omic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiomics,Liquid biopsies,Machine learning,Bioinformatics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"John Blume<sup><\/sup>, Ghristine Bundalian<sup><\/sup>, Jessica Chan<sup><\/sup>, Connie Chao-Shern<sup><\/sup>, Jinlyung Choi<sup><\/sup>, Rea Cuaresma<sup><\/sup>, Kevin Dai<sup><\/sup>, Sara  N.

Current prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based diagnostic strategy for prostate cancer may frequently cause overdiagnosis. In this study, we prospectively recruited 380 individuals, including 167 with pathologically confirmed prostate cancer, 127 with negative prostate biopsy results, and 86 assessed healthy cohort with no need for biopsy. We collected a plasma sample from each participant, performed whole-genome sequencing, and profiled cell-free DNA (cfDNA) neomer and fragmentation characteristics. We then developed a machine learning model using these cfDNA profiles to predict prostate cancer biopsy outcomes. Our results showed that this assay could achieve high accuracy (Accuracy: 85.3%, AUROC: 0.919, 95% CI: 0.892 - 0.946) in repeated 5-fold cross validations. Patients with negative biopsy results had higher prediction scores than healthy individuals (P &#60; 2.2X10<sup>-16<\/sup>), making them less distinguishable from prostate cancer patients (AUROC: 0.878, 95% CI: 0.837 - 0.918 vs. AUROC: 0.980, 95% CI: 0.963 - 0.997). We further combined this cfDNA-based assay with the PSA testing and constructed an ensemble model. The classification performance was further improved in the ensemble model, showing AUROC metrics of 0.951 (95% CI: 0.932 - 0.969) between cancer and non-cancer, 0.919 (95% CI: 0.889 - 0.949) between cancer and negative biopsy, and 0.998 (95% CI: 0.994 - 1.000) between cancer and healthy individuals. At a sensitivity of 90.4%, the ensemble assay accurately identified 85.4% of non-cancerous conditions, including 76.4% of negative biopsy patients and 98.8% of healthy individuals.

Higher amplifiable copies recovered from liquid biopsies can lead to better cancer detection and monitoring. In this study, we evaluated the recovery of cfDNA amplifiable copies and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) dynamics using the nRichDX&nbsp;extraction method, which can extract cfDNA from a broad range of biological fluids (1mL - 20mL). cfDNA quality and ctDNA dynamics were assessed using Liquid IQ and UltraSEEK<sup> <\/sup>on the MassARRAY&nbsp;System.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b> Whole blood from healthy donors was collected in K2EDTA tubes, and plasma was isolated and then pooled in preparation for cfDNA extraction. Plasma aliquots at 5mL (6) and 20mL (6) were extracted using the Revolution Max20 cfDNA Extraction Kit. (12) replicate samples were extracted using QiAmp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit. Half of the samples were spiked with a cfDNA standard containing a KRAS p.G12V mutation. The quantity and quality of extracted cfDNA were determined using the Liquid IQ panel on the MassARRAY system, which measures amplifiable cfDNA copies, high\/low molecular weight dynamics, white blood cell (WBC) contamination along with a molecular barcode for sample matching. Recovery and frequency of the spiked ctDNA standard were performed with the UltraSEEK Lung V2 Panel, capable of detecting variants as low as 0.1% allele frequency.<br \/><b>Results<\/b> This study compared the amplifiable copies recovered from cfDNA extracted using the nRichDX and Qiagen kit.

Tumor and host epigenetic methylation signatures reflect not only tumor phenotype, such as histology, prognosis, protein expression, and functional sub-type, but also that of the tumor microenvironment and the patient, including immune status, therapy-related adverse events, comorbidities, and disease location. Epigenetic markers also provide more sensitive and precise measures of tumor burden, opening up applications for longitudinal therapy response and monitoring. Here we report the initial validation of GuardantINFINITY, a liquid biopsy assay combining genomic information from &#62;800 genes with characterization of the blood-quiet regulatory methylome, both at single-molecule sensitivity from a single tube of peripheral blood.<br \/>Methods: Analytical performance was assessed using 594 cancer patient cfDNA, cell line, and cancer-free donor samples at 5-30ng cfDNA input.<br \/>Results: Reportable ranges established for SNVs were &#8805;0.04% variant allele fraction (VAF), &#8805;0.04% for indels, &#8805;0.06% for fusions, &#8805;2.12 copies for amplifications (CNAs), &#60;1.7 copies for copy loss. Observed 95% limits of detection (LoD) were 0.282% for SNVs across all genes (0.2% for oncogenic hotspots), 0.397% for non-homopolymeric indels, 0.05% for fusions, 2.5 copies for CNAs, 16.3% VAF or 1.84 copies for gene deletions, 7.3 copies for viral (HPV, EBV) detection, and 0.06% for MSI-H. For promoter and sample-level methylation, LoDs were 0.06% and 0.05% tumor fraction, respectively. cfDNA cancer samples demonstrated 100% accuracy for SNVs and Indels above 0.5% VAF and 100% for CNAs and fusions across the reportable range. The analytical false positive rate per base was 6.84e-6 for SNVs, 3.42e-6 for indels, and 0 for CNAs and fusions, with positive predictive values of 97.5% for SNVs, 98% for indels, and 100% for CNAs above 2.5 copies and all tested fusions.<br \/>Conclusions: GuardantINFINITY is a patient-care-ready liquid biopsy capable of integrated genomic and epigenomic analysis of all solid tumors at single-molecule sensitivity. In addition to traditional genotyping compatible with Guardant360 for more content, the technology&#8217;s demonstrated LoD showed the potential for ultra-sensitive ctDNA detection for MRD and recurrence surveillance, tumor fraction quantitation for therapy monitoring, oncogenic virus detection, immunogenotyping, epigenotyping, and tumor phenotype characterization, representing a new standard in biomarker discovery.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-06 Liquid biopsy: Multi-analyte and multi-omic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,DNA methylation,Biomarkers,Methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Tingting Jiang<sup><\/sup>, Indira Wu<sup><\/sup>, Yvonne Kim<sup><\/sup>, Nageswara Alla<sup><\/sup>, Giao Tran<sup><\/sup>, Dustin Ma<sup><\/sup>, Forum Shah<sup><\/sup>, Jun Zhao<sup><\/sup>, Sai Chen<sup><\/sup>, Sante Gnerre<sup><\/sup>, Melis Hazar<sup><\/sup>, Hao Wang<sup><\/sup>, Catalin Barbacioru<sup><\/sup>, Karen Ryall<sup><\/sup>, Ankit Jambusaria<sup><\/sup>, Anupam Chakravarthy<sup><\/sup>, Anthony Zunino<sup><\/sup>, Theresa Pham<sup><\/sup>, Farsheed Ghadiri<sup><\/sup>, Evan Diehl<sup><\/sup>, Benjamin Morck<sup><\/sup>, Arancha Sanchez<sup><\/sup>, Rochelle Dayan<sup><\/sup>, XianXian Liu<sup><\/sup>, Jeffrey Werbin<sup><\/sup>, Jill Lai<sup><\/sup>, <b>Brett Kennedy<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Ross Eppler<sup><\/sup>, Justin Odegaard<sup><\/sup>, Han-Yu Chuang<sup><\/sup>, Helmy Eltoukhy<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Bioinformatics, Guardant Health, Palo Alto, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d6fa8806-d989-4cf4-bf9e-427d6c1bb524","ControlNumber":"7540","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;T.

However, a standard blood draw yields an average of only 10 ng of cfDNA, of which DNA derived from the tumor is a small minority. Therefore, we are faced with a dilemma when utilizing the limited sample to obtain maximum information. Genetic sequencing provides information on actionable somatic mutations but detection of a few loci in a minority of the sample is challenging. Modified cytosine profiles of cancer are differential from non-cancer at many more loci and so provide a stronger signal. Moreover, they can be used to distinguish tissue-of-origin of the tumor. However, methods such as bisulfite sequencing, EM-seq and TAPS sacrifice genetic information (namely C-&#62;T mutations, which are the most common mutation in cancer) to measure modified cytosine. Genetic and modified cytosine data together have been shown to be more powerful for the detection of early cancer than either alone. Here we present a technology, which sequences at base resolution the complete genetic sequence integrated with modified cytosine from low nanogram amounts of cfDNA. It consists of (i) a single pre-sequencing workflow, which creates a copy of the original DNA and performs enzymatic base conversions which discriminate genetic and epigenetic states and (ii) post-sequencing data processing which resolves the resultant sequencing data to an information-rich 16-state code and derives genetic variants integrated with modified cytosine levels, within easy-to-use software. It is, in principle, compatible with any sequencing methodology and is shown here optimized for the Illumina fleet. In cfDNA we show accuracy of modC measurement is higher than that of bisulfite sequencing and EM-seq; and the accuracy of genetic sequencing is higher than that of Illumina alone. Accuracy of measurement is extremely important for liquid biopsy where tumor DNA is in the minority and observed in a small number of reads. We demonstrate the impact of varying base calling error rate on limit of detection for rare alleles in cfDNA samples. Further we show derivation of cfDNA fragment characteristics and that this is produced in combination with genetic and modC information. This further increases the signal available from cfDNA in only one workflow. We suggest this method will help advance the field of liquid biopsy towards its promise.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-06 Liquid biopsy: Multi-analyte and multi-omic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Gene profiling,Epigenomics,Epigenetics,DNA methylation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Fabio Puddu<sup><\/sup>, Casper  K.

Historically, there has been no diagnostic assay that comprehensively evaluates both <i>BRCA1<\/i> PM and genomic alterations in cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Here, we describe the novel detection of <i>BRCA1<\/i> PM and genomic alterations in a cohort of patients with breast cancer using GuardantINFINITY, a liquid biopsy assay interrogating 800+ genes and genome-wide methylation detection.<br \/>Method: We assessed for <i>BRCA1<\/i> PM in ctDNA from 274 patients with late-stage breast cancer. Genomic sequencing of 800+ genes and PM profiling of 398 genes was performed by GuardantINFINITY. The positive calling threshold for PM was established by comparing cell-free DNA derived from patients with cancer and cancer-free donors. The limit of detection (LoD) was determined through <i>in silico<\/i> and experimental titrations of ctDNA from clinical samples and cell lines with known gene PM into the plasma of cancer-free donors.<br \/>Results: Among the 274 patients with advanced breast cancer, 8 (2.9%) had germline pathogenic mutations in <i>BRCA1, BRCA2, or ATM. BRCA1 <\/i>PM was detected in 11\/274 (4.0%) patients at the predefined threshold of &#62;99% specificity. <i>BRCA1<\/i> PM detection in this cohort was 8.9% (8\/90) when excluding samples with low tumor shedding (&#60;1% epigenomic tumor fraction in cfDNA). Among the 11 patients with <i>BRCA1 <\/i>PM detected in ctDNA, one had a co-occurring somatic <i>BRCA1<\/i> nonsense variant (p.S361*); none of the remaining patients with <i>BRCA1 <\/i>PM had another HRR-related mutation detected in cfDNA.

There is increasing evidence that circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) minimal residual disease (MRD) predicts relapse following treatment for solid tumors. However, liquid biopsy analyses are challenged by the very low concentrations of ctDNA in blood samples. Existing ctDNA methods lack the sensitivity needed for detecting minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Here, we describe a tumor-informed personalized hybrid capture based method using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to highly sensitive and specific detect MRD and predict recurrence in plasma cell-free DNA. To validate the performance of the assay, we present a technical validation study on DNA from cancer cell line material, including lung cancer cell line, reference material, Onco gDNA reference standard and wild type gDNA reference standard.<br \/>Method: The performance of the assay was assessed using samples from Onco gDNA reference standard and lung cancer cell line. To estimate number of monitoring single nucleotide variants (SNVs) at input volume of 20-80ng, Onco gDNA reference standard was diluted into 8 concentrations (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 150 and 750 ppm with a variant allele frequency [VAF] range of 0.001% to 0.075%).To estimate limit of detection (LoD) of the assay at input volume of 20ng and 40ng, lung cancer cell line was diluted into 5 concentrations (10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 ppm with a variant allele frequency [VAF] range of 0.001% to 0.016%).10 samples were performed for each concentration, as well as 10 negative reference samples. Personalized panel was performed using ultradeep (100,000X) NGS with customized 55 or 60 SNVs.<br \/>Result: Validation results of Onco gDNA reference standard: using 40 variants, sensitivity of input volume of 20ng and 40ng are 95% and 98% at 40 ppm, with a specificity of 100%, respectively. Using 40 variants, sensitivity of input volume of 60ng are 95% at 20 ppm, with a specificity of 100%. Using 50 variants, sensitivity of input volume of 60ng are 70% at 10 ppm, with a specificity of 100%.

Recent studies have shown that CTCs undergo cellular changes, such as an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), with disease progression and metastasis, implying the heterogeneity of the tumor cell population in circulation. Systems for CTC isolation are often limited by a requirement for epithelial markers or separate systems for identification of CTCs. As such, an automated platform that successfully isolates both epithelial and mesenchymal cells and enables identification of cells is necessary for successful study of CTCs. The Genesis System from Bio-Rad&#8482; Laboratories, Inc. isolates rare CTCs based on size and deformability. It also enables users to identify isolated cells through use of an on-slide immunofluorescence (IF) staining workflow, which minimizes sample manipulation and potential sample loss.<br \/>Methods: In order to achieve high-throughput label-free CTC isolation, the Genesis System uses Celselect Slides&#8482;. Each slide contains 56,400 individual microchambers to capture CTCs while maintaining viability. This Celselect Slide technology can be used for either enrichment or enumeration protocols. For this study, enumeration protocols were performed to capture and identify CTCs using on-slide IF staining. Enrichment protocols were utilized to capture, enrich, and retrieve CTCs for downstream applications. The performance was evaluated using a breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, spiked into whole blood from healthy donors.<br \/>Results: The slide isolated 83.95 &#177; 10.25% of spiked cancer cells in blood samples at a concentration of 10-250 cells\/ml. During the CTC enrichment procedure, 99.92% of blood cells were eliminated. Afterwards, 70% of the isolated CTCs were successfully released from the slide and over 92% of the released cells remained viable.<br \/>Discussion and Conclusion: We present a fully automated platform to isolate and identify CTCs using on-slide immunofluorescence staining, which minimizes inevitable cell loss during the workflow. Captured cells can be retrieved for downstream applications to facilitate discovery of unknown CTC functions and their clinical relevance in cancer research. The wide range of possible downstream applications include Droplet Digital&#8482; PCR, quantitative PCR, western blot assays, bulk\/single-cell genomics, cell culture, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and RNA-Seq. Additionally, the design of the system is amenable to other biofluids which may be utilized for liquid biopsies. The Genesis System with Celselect Slide technology offers a powerful diagnostic tool to monitor disease progression and personalized treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-06 Liquid biopsy: Multi-analyte and multi-omic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diagnosis,Cancer detection,Cancer diagnostics,Microfluidics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yoon-Tae Kang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Errile Pusod<sup>1<\/sup>, Ally Crudgington<sup>1<\/sup>, Abiodun Bodunrin<sup>2<\/sup>, Nick Bosio<sup>1<\/sup>, Susana Chan<sup>1<\/sup>, David Coe<sup>1<\/sup>, Michelle Racey<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Bio-Rad Laboratories, Ann Arbor, MI,<sup>2<\/sup>Bio-Rad Laboratories, Pleasanton, CA,<sup>3<\/sup>Bio-Rad Laboratories, Boulder, CO","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"322faf0b-7733-46d4-9786-cc57685618c4","ControlNumber":"925","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

Blood-based liquid biopsies hold promise to reduce morbidity and mortality from lung cancer by enabling early detection to downstage disease at diagnosis, theragnostic identification of patients most likely to be helped or harmed by therapy, monitoring of therapeutic efficacy, and detection of residual disease. PrognomiQ&#8217;s multi-omics platform comprehensively profiles proteins, metabolites, lipids, mRNA, and cfDNA in blood samples which can be used for the development of liquid biopsy tests with high sensitivity and specificity for lung cancer. We conducted a case-control study comprising 1031 subjects: 361 subjects with untreated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 670 matched controls which included 340 subjects with salient pulmonary and gastrointestinal co-morbidities. Blood samples from each subject were processed to provide 7 different `omics readouts. LCMS was used to detect and quantify proteins, metabolites, and lipids. In addition, cfDNA and mRNA were assayed using next-generation sequencing. cfDNA reads were analyzed to estimate fragment-lengths, copy-number variation, and CpG site methylation. All molecular data were normalized using standard methods specific to each assay. Univariate analyses of cases vs controls were performed to identify differentially abundant features on all available samples per assay. We detected 9,868 proteins, 605 lipids, 329 metabolites, and 109,070 mRNA transcripts. Of these, 3,098 proteins, 210 lipids, 57 metabolites, and 30,236 mRNA transcripts were significantly different (FWER &#60; 0.05) in cases versus controls. Gene set enrichment analysis on statistically significant transcripts and proteins identified multiple gene-ontology terms associated with cancer including the Wnt signaling process and IgA immunoglobulin complex, respectively. From cfDNA data, we identified 234 non-contiguous genomic regions associated with the fragment-length disorder, 4,790 with copy-number variation, and 74 differentially methylated genomic regions spanning 184 CpG sites (FWER &#60; 0.05). With the premise that deviations from copy number neutrality are more likely to indicate a tumor contribution, we then focused our examination on those differentially expressed proteins that overlap with differentially expressed mRNA transcripts as well as CNV genomic regions. We identified 52 protein coding genes including E-cadherin (associated with EMT) and related binding proteins such as RAB11B, CAPZB, EPS15, FLNB, MYH9, STK24 and YWHAE. Ongoing machine-learning-based classifier training to distinguish between cancer and non-cancer can serve as the basis for the development of high-sensitivity liquid-biopsy tests for lung cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-06 Liquid biopsy: Multi-analyte and multi-omic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiomics,Liquid biopsies,NSCLC,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Jinlyung Choi<sup><\/sup>, Ajinkya Kokate<sup><\/sup>, Ehdieh Khaledian<sup><\/sup>, <b>Manway Liu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Preethi Prasad<sup><\/sup>, John Blume<sup><\/sup>, Jessica Chan<sup><\/sup>, Rea Cuaresma<sup><\/sup>, Kevin Dai<sup><\/sup>, Manoj Khadka<sup><\/sup>, Thidar Khin<sup><\/sup>, Yuya Kodama<sup><\/sup>, Joon-Yong Lee<sup><\/sup>, Hoda Malekpour<sup><\/sup>, Megan Mora<sup><\/sup>, Nithya Mudaliar<sup><\/sup>, Sara Nouri Golmaei<sup><\/sup>, Madhuvanthi Ramaiah<sup><\/sup>, Saividya Ramaswamy<sup><\/sup>, Peter Spiro<sup><\/sup>, Dijana Vitko<sup><\/sup>, Kavya Swaminathan<sup><\/sup>, James Yee<sup><\/sup>, Brian Young<sup><\/sup>, Chinmay Belthangady<sup><\/sup>, Bruce Wilcox<sup><\/sup>, Brian Koh<sup><\/sup>, Philip Ma<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Prognomiq Inc, San Mateo, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"795b3e26-3f2d-45b2-bbaa-d2e94fa39eda","ControlNumber":"4756","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;J.

Decentralized sample collection, particularly whole blood using dried blood spots (DBS) provides the ideal mechanism for patient driven sample collection with ease of access to sample generation, drug level assessments and metabolomic prMegofiling, providing longitudinal real-time measure of drug specific pharmacodynamic readout for safety and efficacy. In this study, we report the development of a protocol for the capture and comprehensive profiling of metabolomics using dried blood spots from a cohort of 49 healthy volunteer donors. Using liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometric (UPLC-MS\/MS) methods an untargeted metabolomic approach resulted in the identification of &#62;800 biochemicals of which a significant subset was found to be presented in corresponding matched plasma (from whole blood) samples. The biochemicals identified from the DBS samples included metabolites that were part of the lipid, amino acid, nucleotide, peptide, cofactors, carbohydrate and energy super pathways. A significant number of metabolites identified in the DBS samples were xenobiotics including those representing the biotransformation products of drugs. The overall metabolite profiles were analyzed for precision and accuracy of measure, variability in performance and dynamic range to establish benchmarks for evaluation. An additional cohort with a longitudinal sampling as part of the protocol provided the reproducibility of the analytic method for inter-day variability of metabolite performance over time. Although metabolomic profiles varied between individuals from a population perspective, there was minimal variation observed within individuals when samples were profiled longitudinally over several weeks. Thus, the protocols for DBS collection and the corresponding capture of a large set of metabolites with reproducible performance provides an opportunity for its implementation in oncological clinical trials as part of a de-centralized clinical trial solution.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-06 Liquid biopsy: Multi-analyte and multi-omic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Metabolomics,Liquid biopsies,Pharmacodynamics,Biomarkers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Kelli Goodman<sup><\/sup>, <b>Megan  R.

The detection of these remnants and monitoring of their abundance is a promising prognostic marker to identify individuals at risk of recurrence or in need of adjuvant therapy. Due to the low abundance of ctDNA present in samples obtained during remission, MRD assays need to be highly sensitive. In addition, each individual will have a different set of somatic variants, requiring personalized solutions for detection. Therefore, personalized NGS assays with high sensitivity and specificity are needed for MRD diagnostics.<br \/>To address this need and empower accurate assessments of MRD, Twist Bioscience has developed the MRD Rapid 500 Panels. This product enables customers to design, manufacture and ship fully personalized MRD panels (up to 500 targets) in as little as six days.<br \/>To demonstrate the detection sensitivity of Twist Rapid 500 MRD panels, we designed five custom MRD panels which specifically target somatic variants found in Breast, Lung, CRC, Melanoma and Renal Cell Carcinoma. Each of these MRD panels were designed to include 197 targets, with 3-5 variants per tissue origin and a selection of passenger mutations. To create the sample set, we blended synthetic variant sequences with fragmented cell line gDNA (NA12878) to form a contrived specimen which approximates the profile cell-free and circulating tumor DNA. Five frequency levels were created with average VAFs of 0% (WT), 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.1% and 2%. Libraries were prepared with UMI adapters and target enrichment was performed using the MRD panels.<br \/>With a sequencing depth of 80,000x, variant calling results revealed that an average of 20 SNV targets can be detected with confidence in the 0.01% VAF samples for each MRD panel, clearly distinguishable from the WT control samples. In addition to demonstrating the accuracy of variant calling, we showcase the utility of targeting a large number of variants for the detection of an MRD signature at very low levels (e.g. 0.01% VAF).<br \/>In summary, the performance of the Twist MRD Rapid 500 Panels showed high detection sensitivity of ultra low-frequency somatic mutations while maintaining high specificity for the purposes of MRD monitoring.<br \/>*<b><i>For Research Use Only.

At present, changes in DNA sequence, methylation, or copy number are the most sensitive ways to detect the presence of cancer. To increase the sensitivity of such assays, it would be useful to be able evaluate the same template molecules for all these changes. Here we report an approach, called MethylSaferSeqS, that achieves this goal, and can be applied to any standard library preparation method suitable for massively parallel sequencing. The innovative step was to copy both strands of each DNA-barcoded molecule with a primer that allows the subsequent separation of the original strands (retaining their 5-methylcytosine residues) from the copied strands (in which the 5-methylcytosine residues are replaced with unmodified cytosine residues). The original and copied strands are queried for epigenetic and genetic alterations, respectively. We applied this approach to plasma from 265 individuals, including 198 with cancers of the pancreas, ovary, lung or colon, and found the expected patterns of mutations, copy number alterations, and methylation. Furthermore, we could determine which original template DNA molecules were methylated and\/or mutated.

In this regard, early diagnosis drastically decreases mortality, however, around 20% of these patients will later relapse. This is mainly caused by undetectable molecular residual disease (MRD) not eliminated by standard primary treatments. Therefore, it is crucial to detect the after-treatment MRD to stratify the patients by their risk of relapse. Liquid biopsies have emerged as non-invasive method to obtain information about tumors and improve clinical cancer management. Regarding this, much has been hypothesized about utilizing high blood volumes to overcome the necessity of complex and resource-intensive next generation sequencing (NGS) methodologies to detect highly diluted blood tumor components in localized cancers. Herein, we employed a combined analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) together with high blood volumes and single-assay droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect MRD with ultra-high sensitivity. We prospectively assayed 124 samples extracted at baseline, post-neoadjuvant therapy (NAT), post-surgery and a follow-up on a six-monthly basis. A median of 76.40 mL of blood to detect CTCs and 40 mL of plasma to detect ctDNA per patient from 19 BC women were used in this study. ddPCR assays were performed with a median of 14 partitions per determination to detect ctDNA and 12 partitions for CTCs. Overall, ctDNA, CTCs and ctDNA and\/or CTCs were detected in 84.21%, 66.66% and 89.47% respectively in the pre-treatment blood samples. MRD (ctDNA and\/or CTCs) was detected in 73.68% of the after NAT blood samples. On the other hand, it was detected in 46.66% and 70.00% of the post-surgery and follow-up samples respectively. Post-NAT MRD was detected in 57.14% (4\/7) and 83.33% (10\/12) of patients with and without pathological complete response pCR respectively. To note, the discordant patients achieving pCR in tissue with detectable MRD in blood were high-risk BC. Importantly, in one of the two patients without pCR and no MRD detected, not enough sample were available to complete the analysis. The other discordant patient presented a localized disease with residual cancer burden value of 1 and no lymph nodes affected. In 1 out of 19 (5.26%) patient clinically relapsed with a positive MRD detection 6 months earlier. Applying this methodology, we observed a sensitivity of 0.004% in ctDNA detection and 0.224 CTCs per mL of blood. Overall, this novel methodology greatly improves sensitivity for ctDNA and CTCs detection in treatment-na&#239;ve early BC. In addition, MRD was successfully detected in post-treatment samples antedating clinical relapse by 6 months in one patient. This prospective study is potentially demonstrating that using high blood volumes and a single-assay ddPCR is a cost-effective strategy to monitor localized BC and predict relapses.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-06 Liquid biopsy: Multi-analyte and multi-omic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,Circulating tumor cells,Breast cancer,Liquid biopsies,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alfonso Alba-Bernal<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ana Godoy-Ortiz<sup>1<\/sup>, María Emilia Domínguez-Recio<sup>1<\/sup>, Begoña Jimenez-Rodriguez<sup>1<\/sup>, María Elena Quirós-Ortega<sup>1<\/sup>, Esperanza López-López<sup>1<\/sup>, Guillermo Carbajosa-Antona<sup>2<\/sup>, Jesús Peralta-Linero<sup>3<\/sup>, Luis Vicioso<sup>2<\/sup>, Estefanía Bellagarza-García<sup>3<\/sup>, Guadalupe Dolores Garrido-Ruiz<sup>4<\/sup>, Cynthia Robles-Podadera<sup>1<\/sup>, Alicia Garrido-Aranda<sup>1<\/sup>, María Dunia Roldán-Díaz<sup>1<\/sup>, Jesús Velasco-Suelto<sup>1<\/sup>, Rocío Lavado-Valenzuela<sup>1<\/sup>, Martina Álvarez<sup>2<\/sup>, Nuria Ribelles<sup>1<\/sup>, Javier Pascual<sup>1<\/sup>, Emilio Alba<sup>2<\/sup>, Iñaki Comino-Méndez<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Biomedical Research Institute of Málaga, Málaga, Spain,<sup>2<\/sup>University Of Málaga, Málaga, Spain,<sup>3<\/sup>Unidad de Gestión Clínica Intercentros de Oncología Médica, Hospitales Universitarios Regional y Virgen de la Victoria, Málaga, Spain,<sup>4<\/sup>Radiology Department, Hospital Clínico Universitario Virgen de la Victoria de Málaga, Málaga, Spain","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e43c6634-818b-4660-8096-ecef90359554","ControlNumber":"4315","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Advanced DNA barcoding and automated microfluidics can take this to the next level, enabling multiomic characterization of single cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) offer a window into the immune system that, when combined with these omics tools, can provide an insight into immune cells mediating anti-tumor responses in cancer patients. Here we detail a workflow using a single blood draw to rapidly produce a diverse set of multiomics results including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics and proteomics. This starts with automated sample handling and processing of the primary blood draw to ensure high viability and yield of PBMCs, along with simultaneous plasma separation and collection. These samples are then aliquoted and simultaneously processed for automated and semi-automated whole exome sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing, methylation sequencing and Olink proteomics assay. Germline and somatic mutations can be detected using whole exome or whole genome sequencing with deep coverage, whereas methylation, ATAC or ChIP sequencing can be used for epigenetic characterization of the same sample. While bulk expression offers a high-level transcriptomics profile, single-cell transcriptomics facilitates detection of gene expression changes in each individual cell type, allowing for analysis of rare cell types including circulating tumor cells. Olink proteomic assays can be utilized for both biomarker discovery and validation, with highly targeted or broad-spectrum panels. With this robust workflow and advanced robotics for sample handling and processing to minimize potential batch effects, all these datatypes can be produced within days of primary sample collection using minimal sample amounts. High throughput integrative omics workflows, as described here, are useful in gaining a multidimensional view of cancer and advance immunotherapies by characterizing immune cell modulation in tumor progression, and can be expanded for use in tumor\/normal analysis, evaluation of metastases and exploration of tumor microenvironment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-06 Liquid biopsy: Multi-analyte and multi-omic,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiomics,Single cell transcriptomics,Proteomics,Genomics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Bhagyashree  S.

The hallmarks reflect generic properties across all cancer types, and are not directly quantifiable nor applicable in cancer diagnostics. Here, we applied a data-driven approach to identify quantifiable hallmarks to be used as a basis for precision cancer medicine (PCM) in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).<br \/>We applied deep exome, transcriptome, DNA methylation and proteome profiling as well as ex-vivo functional testing of 525 drugs to 118 AML patient samples. Unsupervised multi-omic dimensionality reduction defined 11 independent axes of biological variability that we interpreted to reflect data-driven hallmarks (DDHM) of AML. Each DDHM integrates and ranks different data types and features, pinpointing those molecular features that were most informative for each hallmark. We calculated values for the 11 DDHM for each patient, constructing a DDHM-based precision medicine approach for AML diagnosis and therapy assignment.<br \/>Most DDHMs were driven by other data types than genomics. For several DDHMs, different cytogenetic and mutational drivers converge on the same hallmarks and specific drug vulnerabilities. We also see how DDHM predictors of poor prognosis and high-risk AML are distinct from those that dictate specific drug response vulnerabilities.<br \/>DDHM 2 reflected the cell differentiation path leading towards resistance to BH3 mimetics, ACK-inhibitors, and anthracyclines, and sensitivity to MEK inhibitors and TLR8 agonists. DDHM 2 derived a strong impact from protein expression of GATA2, MLLT11, DNMT3B and from RNA expression of WT1 and SOX4 as well as from multiple markers of different monocytic subtypes. DDHM 5 depicted cell cycle regulation and the Megakaryocytic-erythrocyte progenitor cell state that was enriched in AML patients with antecedent hematological disease. Interestingly, DDHM5 was linked to the sensitivity to purine analogs and vinca alkaloids. Moreover, DDHMs 1 and 8 captured clinical risk groups, prognosis, and responsiveness to hypomethylating agents. These DDHMs also revealed the phenotypic and functional biology that distinguished patients with high versus low FLT3-ITD mutant allele frequency.<br \/>Validation of the DDHMs is realized through profiling and analysis of prospective AML samples, AML cell lines and previously published datasets.<br \/>In summary, we present a data-driven approach for defining hallmarks in AML. The application of the DDHMs in AML provides a new paradigm for PCM and an opportunity for combinatorial therapeutic targeting. Each patient is characterized by a combination of independent and potentially druggable hallmarks, as opposed to traditional stratification in PCM, where each patient is assigned to one specific subgroup defined by genetic or other biomarkers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-05 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,Precision medicine,High-throughput assay,Hallmarks of cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tom Erkers<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nona Struyf<sup>1<\/sup>, Tojo James<sup>1<\/sup>, Francesco Marabita<sup>1<\/sup>, Mattias Vesterlund<sup>1<\/sup>, Nghia Vu<sup>1<\/sup>, Cornelia Arnroth<sup>1<\/sup>, Albin Österroos<sup>2<\/sup>, Anna Bohlin<sup>1<\/sup>, Sofia Bengtzén<sup>1<\/sup>, Matthias Stahl<sup>1<\/sup>, Rozbeh Jafari<sup>1<\/sup>, Lukas Orre<sup>1<\/sup>, Yudi Pawitan<sup>1<\/sup>, Brinton Seashore-Ludlow<sup>1<\/sup>, Janne Lehtiö<sup>1<\/sup>, Sören Lehmann<sup>2<\/sup>, Päivi Östling<sup>1<\/sup>, Olli Kallioniemi<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden,<sup>2<\/sup>Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a3f813b2-010a-4d09-83f1-f8033965b208","ControlNumber":"4386","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

Current techniques to evaluate DDR rely on immunostaining for gamma H2AX foci (&#947;H2AX), which is an indicator of DNA double-strand break formation. While &#947;H2AX immunostaining can provide a snapshot of DDR in fixed cellular and tissue samples, this method is technically cumbersome as: 1) temporal monitoring of DDR requires timepoint replicates; 2) extensive assay development efforts for 3D samples such as organoids, and 3) protocols for &#947;H2AX immunostaining and its evaluation are time-consuming. The goal of this project is to reduce overall burden on assay duration and development in NSCLC organoids by leveraging label-free multiphoton imaging.<br \/>Method: To predict DDR in 3D organoid samples, label-free multimodal multiphoton techniques such as simultaneous label-free autofluorescence multiharmonic (SLAM) imaging can provide intracellular information based on endogenous contrast mechanisms. SLAM makes use of a single laser to excite autofluorescence in multiple cellular components including FAD and NAD(P)H, enabling the calculation of the optical redox ratio, which estimates the equilibrium of electron donating versus accepting species in cells. Moreover, label-free, multiphoton systems enable imaging of live samples without the need to add labels or generate sacrificial samples and have improved image acquisition in 3D space over conventional confocal microscopy. Using SLAM, we propose to predict DDR in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) organoids. NSCLC organoids recapitulate histological and genetic features of their derived patient tissue, retaining tumor variability.<br \/>Results: Predictive modeling via gradient boost regressor between handcrafted SLAM image features and &#947;H2AX immunostained images on weakly-paired images confirmed strong correlation between SLAM image features and &#947;H2AX speckles\/nuclei. Across multiple patient derived NSCLC organoid lines and multiple DNA targeting chemotherapeutics, the optical redox ratio was demonstrated to robustly predict DDR.<br \/>Conclusion: Label-free imaging via SLAM can be used to predict DDR in live 3D NSCLC organoids with minimal sample handling and without the need to add labelled reporters, enabling quicker and less technically involved DDR assaying.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-05 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Organoids,DNA damage response,Molecular imaging,Redox,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Terrence  T.

Recent studies conjecture that oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are precursors for glioma. The etiology of OPC derived oligodendrogliomas, the corresponding genetic program and genetic aberrations, and the underlying mechanisms leading to the pathogenesis of oligodendroglioma is yet to be explored. We hypothesize that genetic mechanisms mediating oligodendrogenesis (the process of OPCs maturing to oligodendrocytes (OL)) are temporally and spatially coordinated. In this study, we spearhead a comprehensive computational framework that utilizes a) Machine learning (ML) to interpret spatial transcriptomic (ST) images of a normal whole mouse brain dataset obtained from Vizgen&#8217;s MERFISH Mouse Brain Receptor Map and b) mathematical modeling to perturb the cellular mechanisms in the normal brain to understand the abnormalities leading to the pathogenesis of oligodendroglioma.<br \/>Methods: Using ML for clustering and trajectory inference, we create a comprehensive spatial catalog of cell types. The cell types are validated using canonical genes from the scRNAseq mouse brain data from CZI Biohub&#8217;s Tabula Muris Consortium. From the cell types, we extract potential OL pseudotime differentiation (from immature to mature OLs) trajectories. These trajectories are used to develop a phenotype structured partial differentiation equation (PDE) model of oligodendrogenesis. This can be used to simulate both spatial and phenotypic interactions, differentiation status, and the pathogenesis of oligodendroglioma by mathematically perturbing the process of cellular proliferation and differentiation using genes known to cause oligodendroglioma: PDGFRA, OLIG1, MAS1.<b> <\/b><br \/>Results: We mathematically perturb cell differentiation lineages in normal oligodendrogenesis to simulate, and predict the effects of perturbation and how this leads to abnormal (cancer aiding) cell states. Our PDE simulations reinforce that OPC proliferation and OL differentiation occur more in the white matter in the normal mouse brain, and further postulate that OPC and OL differentiation occur more in gray matter in malignant mouse brains.<br \/>Conclusions: Our study is one of the earliest attempts to integrate qualitative and scalable ML techniques with quantitative and interpretable mathematical modeling at the cellular, omics, and organ level using ST imaging and sequencing data. We develop and calibrate PDE mathematical models for robustly simulating, predicting, and studying the effects of perturbation from sparse, noisy single cell spatial measurements to forecast abnormal behavior in OLs based on spatial and (pseudo)temporal changes. In future work, we will apply our framework to jointly perturb differentiation trajectories of multiple cell types to understand their cumulative effects in tumor progression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-07 Mathematical modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Modeling,Image analysis,Cell proliferation,Cancer progression,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sandhya Prabhakaran<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Heyrim Cho<sup>2<\/sup>, Maximilian Strobl<sup>3<\/sup>, Russell Rockne<sup>4<\/sup>, Alexander  R.

While significant investments were made to understand the role of T-cells, the contribution of myeloid cells in limiting the effectiveness of I-O therapies is not well understood primarily due to limitations posed by conventional immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis that typically provides information on a single target. We developed a clinical grade multiplex fluorescence IHC (mFIHC) assay to simultaneously evaluate different subsets of myeloid cells (e.g., M1, M2 and MDSC) as well as PD-L1 receptors associated with these subsets as the latter is known to have profound positive impact on patients treated with PD-1 blockers <i>(Liu et al., CCR, 2019)<\/i>. In addition, we developed an algorithm to identify the microenvironment using imaging datasets from AQUA&#174; (Automated Quantitative Analysis) and HALO to understand the spatial relationship between tumor cells and myeloid cell subsets as well as immune checkpoint (IC) expression. mFIHC combined with hypothesis driven spatial profiling algorithms (e.g., AQUA Technology) were found to provide superior predictors of I-O therapies in a systematic meta-analysis of over 8000 patients treated with PD1\/L1 pathway blockers (<i>Lu et al., JAMA Oncol 2019)<\/i>. Furthermore, spatial profiling by AQUA has proven to robustly identify powerful biomarker predictors (PD1\/PDL1) in melanoma (<i>Johnson et al., CCR, 2018<\/i>). Implementation of mFIHC coupled with robust image analysis may provide great insight into immune surveillance, mechanisms of resistance and patient stratification.<br \/>Study Design: We designed a novel mFIHC assay (CD68, CD163, HLA-DR, IDO-1, PD-L1, PanMel-CK) and evaluated various myeloid and tumor cell types on tissue sections (e.g., non-small cell lung cancer, gastric carcinoma, breast carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma). Following the initial evaluation, the mFIHC assay was validated for clinical trial application using automated staining (Leica Bond RX) and imaging (PhenoImager HT). We conducted image analysis using AQUA and HALO technologies.<br \/>Results: Analysis of samples by AQUA and HALO revealed unique myeloid microenvironments in the examined tissue types. Microenvironment data from AQUA and HALO were assessed by analyzing enrichment of macrophage phenotypes in areas dense with checkpoint markers. Our analysis revealed unique myeloid cell clusters in the assessed tumor microenvironments.<br \/>Conclusion: We anticipate this hypothesis driven clinical trial grade mFIHC assay design combined with novel analyses algorithms will aid in the better understanding of the immunomodulatory effects of myeloid cells in several cancer types and the development of next generation I-O therapies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diagnostic marker,Checkpoint,Image analysis,Cancer markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Richard Van Krieken<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Lisa Adams<sup>1<\/sup>, Beiru Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Emmanuel Pacia<sup>1<\/sup>, Naveen Dakappagari<sup>2<\/sup>, Brian Bourke-Martin<sup>3<\/sup>, Jennifer Bordeaux<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Digital Pathology, Navigate BioPharma, Carlsbad, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Navigate BioPharma, Carlsbad, CA,<sup>3<\/sup>Data Science, Navigate BioPharma, Carlsbad, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c5d021b1-2ce0-434a-8c64-160d6f7cb337","ControlNumber":"1520","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;R.

Slides were scanned using the Akoya PhenoImager HT. To remove bleed-through between different fluorophores, mIF WSIs were linearly unmixed based on a reference single-stain matrix, generated by selecting pure stain regions in mIF images. Convolutional neural network models previously trained on hematoxylin and eosin (H&#38;E) images for 1) artifact detection, 2) tissue region identification, and 3) nucleus detection and segmentation were then deployed on mIF images that were converted to RGB images using a synthetic H&#38;E transformation. Cell segmentation models were developed and implemented for each marker assessed. For each demixed channel representing a single antibody signal, expert annotations were used to train deep learning models for cell detection and segmentation. Finally, segmentation results from separate channels were aggregated based on spatial colocalization to identify cells and cell phenotypes.&nbsp;<br \/><b>Results. <\/b>We developed a pipeline for mIF image analysis at scale. After unmixing, conversion of an mIF image to a synthetic H&#38;E image allowed for 1) removal of artifact regions, 2) detection of cancer and stroma using tissue segmentation, and 3) nuclei segmentation.&nbsp; Nuclear segmentation using this approach improved upon a widely used commercial segmentation platform when compared to manual expert annotations (Dice scores = 0.85 and 0.52, respectively). Finally, using state-of-the-art instance segmentation models allows a novel approach to cell phenotyping compared to currently available platforms, allowing positive identification of cells lacking a nuclear signal in the sectioned plane (e.g. large cytokeratin-positive cells).&nbsp;<br \/><b>Conclusions. <\/b>We developed a robust workflow to accurately segment cells and nuclei from mIF WSIs at scale. Improving the scalability and reproducibility of complex mIF image analysis may help improve the adoption of this approach for biomarker development and incorporation into clinical trial workflows in oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Image analysis,High-throughput assay,Multiplex automation,Deep learning,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Waleed Tahir<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Emma Krause<sup><\/sup>, Jin Li<sup><\/sup>, Howard Mak<sup><\/sup>, Mohammad Mirzadeh<sup><\/sup>, Kevin Rose<sup><\/sup>, Judy Shen<sup><\/sup>, Vignesh Valaboju<sup><\/sup>, Guillaume Chhor<sup><\/sup>, Joseph Lee<sup><\/sup>, Jun Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Jacqueline Brosnan-Cashman<sup><\/sup>, Michael G.

However, biopsies sample only a limited amount of the prostate gland. Many studies report that GS6 cancer at biopsy is often upgraded in the radical prostatectomy. Undergrading results from sampling limitations of the biopsy - both of the prostate and of tissue within the biopsy. Since pathological diagnosis is based on 4 micron thick sections of 1 mm thick biopsies, only 0.4% of the biopsy is analyzed. We hypothesize that the evaluation of a biopsy in 3D results in variable Gleason scores or even no cancer in certain z-levels. Here, we examined 3D pathology image datasets of Gleason score 7 (GS7) biopsies using a web-based image viewing platform to determine if they underdiagnose and\/or undergrade cancer when examined by conventional 2D slide-based histology.<br \/>Methods: We used a custom-developed 3D open-top light-sheet (OTLS) microscope, not yet available for clinical use, to study all z-levels of a prostate biopsy. The patient cohort used in this study came from the Canary TMA study. 105 prostate biopsies were non-destructively digitized in 3D with at least 500 z-levels per biopsy (at a spacing of ~1 micron per level). Samples were stained with fluorescence analogs of H&#38;E. The image datasets were false colored to m&#237;mic conventional H&#38;E histology. A pathologist reviewed the images using a web-based image platform and gave overall Gleason scores (OGS) based examing all z-levels within a biopsy. Six z-levels (1, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500) were selected for 2D Gleason scoring.<br \/>Results: 63 images had a OGS of 3+4 and 42 a OGS 4+3. We found presence of GS6 (Gleason grade 3 glands only) in some z-levels: 32 cases (50.8%) with OGS 3+4 and 4 cases (9.5%) with OGS 4+3. When we only studied the 6 selected z-levels, we found z-levels with no cancer in 4 cases (6.3%) of OGS 3+4 and 2 cases (4.8%) in OGS 4+3. In addition, we found z-levels with limited number of glands. We reported these levels as Atypical Small Acinar Proliferation (ASAP) in 2 cases (3.2%) with OGS 3+4 and 3 cases (7.1%) with OGS 4+3. Examining all z-levels enabled unambiguous grading of biopies containing z-levels with ASAP and tangential sections.<br \/>Conclusion: We describe the frequent coexistence of GS6 z-levels within a OGS7 3D prostate biopsy. This finding supports prior observations that finding of GS6 prostate cancer in a 2D-based sections of prostate cancer does not rule out a higher Gleason grade areas in other parts of the prostate nor in other levels of each biopsy. We also show that availability of 3D levels eases the interpretation of ASAP glands and tangential sections.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Gleason score,Digital pathology,Open-top light-sheet microscope,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xavier Farré<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Vanessa Roybal<sup>2<\/sup>, Can Koyuncu<sup>3<\/sup>, Sarah Chow<sup>2<\/sup>, Hongyi Huang<sup>2<\/sup>, Alan Aberdeen<sup>4<\/sup>, Andrew Janowczyk<sup>3<\/sup>, Anant Madabhushi<sup>3<\/sup>, Lawrence  D.

However, many BC patients eventually progress on therapy. To understand how ER+ metastatic BC (mBC) tumors become refractory to CDK4\/6i, we have created a multimodal, longitudinal tumor atlas to investigate tumor mechanisms of therapeutic resistance, as part of the NCI Cancer Moonshot Human Tumor Atlas Network. By deeply profiling individual patients, we identified a wide variety of putative tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms of resistance to CDK4\/6i.<br \/><i>Methods: mBC ER+ <\/i>patients (n=5) enrolled in the Knight Cancer Institute SMMART Trials program underwent biopsies before treatment and on progression with combination CDK4\/6i and endocrine therapy. Biopsies were profiled using: clinical imaging, bulk genomics (WES), transcriptomics (RNAseq), and proteomics (RPPA), multiplex tissue imaging (mIHC, cycIF), single-cell genomics (scDNAseq) and epigenomics (sci-ATAC-seq).<br \/><i>Results: <\/i>Upon progression,<i> <\/i>patients displayed dysregulated tumor-intrinsic activity via upregulation of gene expression in cell cyclins and kinases as well as genomic copy loss of regulatory factors, such as Rb. On-progression biopsies exhibited increased expression and pathway activity of IL-Jak-Stat and Interferon signaling and changes in tumor microenvironment immune cell composition, including elevated immune cytotoxicity; however, a subset of CD8 T cells expressed LAG3, Tbet, and TIM3, indicating signs of immune activation trending toward exhaustion. Patients also exhibited increased M2 Macrophage and T regulatory cell infiltration, suggesting compensatory feedback to dampen immune activity. Analysis of spatial organization identified cellular neighborhoods recurring across all samples with changes after therapy observed primarily in neighborhoods associated with epithelial-stromal density and immune reactivity\/suppression.<br \/><i><\/i><i>Conclusion: <\/i>Findings from this mBC ER+ cohort highlight heterogenous molecular and cellular changes that occur after treatment with a CDK4\/6i. We observed multiple tumor intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including modulation of proliferation in neoplastic cells and tumor microenvironment composition, that are suggested to play a role in acquired resistance. We hypothesize a set of patients that initially respond to CDK4\/6i therapy may initially display immune activation, but the sustained activation and long-term exposure to therapy may lead to chronic inflammation and immunosuppression. These observations suggest combining CDK4\/6i therapy with immunotherapy may provide benefit.

Certain lymphomas, such as Hodgkin and T-cell rich B-cell lymphoma, may contain fewer than 1% malignant cells in a largely inflammatory background. These rare malignant cells have unique interactions with local tumor microenvironments (TME), in some cases driving distinct gene expression patterns for individual B-cells. This presents a challenging fundamental biology landscape, which can create uncertainty in directing patient care or developing new therapies. The lack of tools allowing subtyping of malignant B-cells while simultaneously preserving the context of local TMEs and providing deep spatial transcriptomic sequencing further complicates analysis.<br \/>Here we have developed an integrated, single-slide workflow of virtual H&#38;E staining using the inherent tissue autofluorescence (PictorLabs, Los Angeles, CA) of formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded lymphoma tissue sections on the GeoMx<sup>&#174;<\/sup> Digital Spatial Profiler (Nanostring, Seattle, WA) combined with spatial expression analysis of 1,800 genes using the Cancer Transcriptome Atlas (CTA) panel. The H&#38;E virtual staining allows for the assessment of B-cell lymphoma subtypes, identification and phenotyping of malignant B-cells and the immediately proximal (within 30&#181;m) TME regions by a certified pathologist. These regions of interest (ROI) are spatially profiled for transcriptional expression determined by NGS sequencing of the RNA target specific DNA oligo tags.<br \/>We benchmarked our system by analyzing four lymphoma cases: Nodular sclerosis classical Hodgkin, Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin, T-cell\/histiocyte rich large B-cell, and Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Using virtual H&#38;E staining on the GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler platform, a pathologist correctly identified the diagnosis and subtype based on the morphology. Regions of inflammatory B- and T-cells could be distinguished from lymphoma cells on virtual staining, allowing subset segregation for digital transcriptional expression profiling with the GeoMx CTA panel. Additionally, background TME more distant to B-cell lymphoma as well as regions of high T-cell infiltration were selected for profiling. Analysis of the ROIs revealed distinct transcriptional profiles of malignant B-cells (including cell-of-origin signature), the signaling contributions of local TMEs (versus non-adjacent regions) and confirmed that the expression patterns are further influenced by the presence of T-cell infiltration.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Imaging,Lymphoma,Gene expression profiling,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Michael  E.

HCMV is also a major cause of neuropathology in immune-compromised patients. Since HCMV reactivation frequently causes encephalopathy during chemotherapy or radiation therapy in brain tumor patients, understanding the brain niche-HCMV crosstalk signaling may pinpoint effective strategies in managing brain metastases.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> We collected nine pairs of primary breast and brain metastatic tumor samples from our institution and analyzed their RNA-Seq data. Pairwise differential gene expression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were conducted. TCGA-BRCA (n=1,222) dataset was used for clinical and immune-infiltration correlation analysis. GSE12276 (n=204) dataset was used for brain-metastasis free survival correlation. Immunohistochemistry staining of HCMV was conducted on sixteen primary breast and brain metastatic tumor sections and an 86-core tissue microarray (TMA) of human brain metastasis tissue. CCCExplorer software was used to explore molecular crosstalk signaling between the secretome proteins from HCMV-infected cells and brain metastatic niche cells.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b><i> Reactome <\/i><i>Human cytomegalovirus<\/i><i> (<\/i><i>HCMV) early and late events<\/i> was the top enriched pathway for the 371 brain metastasis up-regulated genes while <i>Reactome IL4 and IL5 signaling <\/i>was the top enriched pathway for the 2,153 primary breast tumor up-regulated genes. Among the 371 brain metastasis up-regulated genes, 287 genes are also up-regulated in primary breast cancer <i>vs.<\/i> normal breast in the TCGA 1222 cohort (P&#60;0.05). High expression of 19 out of the 287 genes are significantly associated with poor brain metastasis-free survival in the GSE12276 cohort (Logrank P&#60;0.05). We further identified that elevated expression of 12 out of the 19 genes are consistently associated with Th2 cell activation and NK cell deactivation in the TCGA 1,222 cohort, for which immunosuppressive Th2 cells are defined by secretion of IL4 and IL5 signature cytokines. Immunoreactive HCMV reactivation proteins were examined in the paired breast tumor and brain metastatic specimens, and most of the TMA tumors. Preventive treatment of an anti-HCMV drug, ganciclovir, by suppressing viral DNA replication inhibited tumor colonization in the mouse brains of the two HCMV-positive PDX models. Several HCMV cell-entry co-receptors are highly expressed in brain metastatic niche. Furthermore, from the secretome of HCMV-infected cells, we identified 89 paired receptors that potentially regulate niche cell behaviors.<br \/><b>Conclusions: <\/b>Our systemic analysis revealed a causal relationship between HCMV reactivation and brain metastatic outgrowth.

However, the reliability of ctDNA for profiling the primary tumor may be compromised by spatial heterogeneity in the tumor genetics, for example due to selective effects of differential drug penetration, immune infiltration, and oxygenation. We explore the influence of spatial factors on tumor genetics through a lattice-based branching process model of solid tumor evolution and ctDNA shedding with the goal of understanding where spatially variable selection pressure could lead to a significant difference between the clonal fractions in the blood and the tissue. The lattice model divides space into regions with different growth rates which result in different rates of driver mutation accumulation. The effects of regional differences in selection cause different apoptosis rates to correlate with the location of expanding driver clones. Using these rates to simulate ctDNA shedding, our model found that clones fit enough to invade a hostile region are temporarily amplified in the blood compared to their tissue frequency by as much as 300% for a limited window of time before the population expands further and the clonal fraction in the blood returns to close agreement with tissue. The results suggest evolutionary contexts in which liquid biopsy might provide highly biased estimates of tumor state, but also shows how this effect might be exploited to provide more sensitive detection of clonal expansion with implications for blood-based detection of recurrence and metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-07 Mathematical modeling,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,Spatial,Modeling,Tumor evolution,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Thomas  W.

However, discovery of biomarkers that predict patient response to immunotherapy has thus far been unsuccessful. Diverse sets of biomarkers have been proposed, (e.g., PD-L1 immunohistochemistry, tumor mutation burden, gene expression signatures), but have failed to validate in clinical studies. There is an urgent need to identify predictive biomarkers for selecting kidney cancer patients most likely to respond to immunotherapy.Spatial biology technologies provide molecular data at single cell resolution along with spatial coordinates in patient&#8217;s tumor slides. We hypothesized that the presence of immune cell types and their spatial 2-D patterns in a histology image could potentially predict response to immunotherapy. For this project we are using Tissue Microarray (TMAs). We are using two cohorts of data: (Dataset-1) 70 clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors, and (Dataset-2) 180 patients, early stage papillary RCC (PRCC) cohort. Dataset-1 was assayed using CosMx (Nanostring technologies) for a RNA panel of 980 immune-related genes. Dataset-2 was assayed with PhenoCycler (Akoya Biosciences) for a 31 marker protein panel with immune-related genes. We have developed methodology and novel algorithms to process both the datasets and to identify spatial phenotypes. Our pipelines include QC, normalization, dimensionality reduction and clustering. For annotation of cell types, we used as reference single cell datasets from RCC to identify tumor-type specific cell types. These cell types were mapped back to their spatial coordinates and visualized. We verified the annotations based on visual checks of their cellular morphology and organization. Next, we identified cellular neighborhoods around each cell and identified spatial clusters. We also performed a network-based analysis to identify additional spatial patterns. We performed correlation analysis with clinical phenotypes and identified spatial clusters of immune cell subtypes located in proximity of cancer cells to be associated with response to therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Biomarkers,Bioinformatics,Immunotherapy,Image analysis,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Kathryn Beckermann<sup>1<\/sup>, Scott Haake<sup>1<\/sup>, Alex Nesta<sup>2<\/sup>, Michael Caponegro<sup>2<\/sup>, N R Nirmala<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Anupama Reddy<\/b><sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN,<sup>2<\/sup>Vindhya Data Science, Morrisville, NC","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"5fc044e7-2059-4551-b342-73b19d5f7d43","ControlNumber":"6153","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;K.

TILs are typically quantified using standard hematoxylin\/eosin (H&#38;E) slides manually by trained pathologists; limitations include interobserver variability and need for cutoffs that aid in clinical decision making. Computational approaches utilizing H&#38;E slides have potential to improve reproducibility and refine predictive\/prognostic utility by evaluation of additional metrics beyond quantification.<br \/>Methods: H&#38;E whole slide images digitized at 20x magnification from patients with stage I-III TNBC (ER\/PR &#8804;10%, HER2 negative) treated with neo\/adjuvant chemotherapy at two institutions were utilized. All cell nuclei were automatically segmented using a deep learning model (Hover-Net) and classified as TIL or non-TIL based on morphological features. Features related to TIL density, spatial distribution, and morphological features were extracted. The top 3 features determined by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were used to train a Cox proportional hazards regression model (SpaTILs) that assigned a recurrence free survival (RFS) event risk score to each patient. First quartile risk score in the training cohort was used as a cutoff for SpaTILs high vs low risk. Model performance for prediction of RFS and overall survival (OS) was evaluated in the testing cohort by Kaplan Meier method, with SpaTILs high vs low risk groups compared by log rank test and Cox regression analysis.<br \/>Results: In the training cohort (n=26) and testing cohort (n=62), median age was 51 and 53 years, 77% and 36% were node positive, and 81% and 45% received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, respectively. Median follow up in testing and training cohorts was 2.3 and 6.8 y, respectively. In the testing cohort, 31% and 69% of patients were categorized as SpaTILs high and low risk, respectively. Baseline characteristics were not significantly different between SpaTILs high and low risk patients. In the SpaTILs high and low risk groups, 5y RFS was 53% and 90%, respectively (HR 4.85 [95% CI: 1.62-14.52], p=0.002) and 5y OS was 78% and 98%, respectively (HR 13.91 [95% CI 1.67-115.66], p=0.001). SpaTIL high risk remained a significant predictor for RFS and OS after adjusting for T stage and nodal status: HR 7.25 (95% CI 2.14-24.39), p=0.001 for RFS; HR 4.80 (95% CI 1.31-131.06), p=0.028 for OS.<br \/>Conclusion: The computational model based on TILs density, spatial, and morphological features (SpaTILs) was independently prognostic for RFS and OS in early stage TNBC.

Current 2D histopathological techniques introduce under-sampling error (i.e., a single 5 um section represents 0.5% of a 1 mm thick biopsy), interobserver variability, and fail to capture the biology contained within the entire tissue sample. We have developed a suite of technologies to stain, chemically clarify, image, visualize, and analyze entire intact NSCLC tissue samples.<br \/>Methods: Human NSCLC tissue, stored frozen in OCT, was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with nuclear (TOPRO-3) and general protein (Eosin) fluorescent dyes, and optically cleared using a modified iDISCO protocol with ethyl cinnamate as the refractive index matching solution. Whole, intact tissue samples, roughly 1-5mm3 in volume, were imaged at 2 microns\/pixel resolution with an open-top light-sheet microscope (3Di, Alpenglow Biosciences). Smaller regions of interest (ROIs) with key pathologic features were reimaged at higher resolution, 0.17 microns\/pixel, to reveal subnuclear features and for cell typing. Visualization was performed using Aivia software.<br \/>Results: NSCLC tissue samples were successfully imaged in 3D. Low resolution images (2 microns\/pixel) were obtained within 4-31 minutes, depending on the tissue volume. The 3D distribution of cancer cells, immune cells, vessels, and fibrosis varied substantially throughout the volume of the tissue. Recognizable histologic features, including nests of tumor cells surrounded by vasculature and immune cells, were readily visualized. Squamous and adenocarcinoma with its subtypes (solid, acinar, lepidic, and micropapillary) morphologies were recognizable in 2D optical sections of the 3D datasets. Imaging quality degraded in tissue deeper than 1 mm due to light scattering.<br \/>Conclusion: We assessed intact NSCLC tissue samples measuring up to 5 mm3 using our custom light-sheet microscope and tissue clearing techniques. This novel method enables us to visualize key features of NSCLC such as the tumor interfaces, tertiary lymphoid structures, vessels and fibrosis in the entire tissue sample, preventing under sampling error, and potentially enabling new biologic insights. Next steps include segmentation and quantification of key tissue structures such as tumor volume, immune cell distribution, and fibrosis \/ immune cell exclusion. This proof-of-concept study provides motivation for further investigation into the significance of 3D tissue features in NSCLC tissue samples.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-02 Digital pathology ,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor microenvironment,Deep learning,Image analysis,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alexandra Alvarsson<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Carl Storey<sup>1<\/sup>, Brandy Olin Pope<sup>1<\/sup>, Caleb Stoltzfus<sup>1<\/sup>, Robert Vierkant<sup>2<\/sup>, Jessica Tufariello<sup>3<\/sup>, Aaron Bungum<sup>4<\/sup>, Julia Naso<sup>5<\/sup>, Cheuk Ki Chan<sup>5<\/sup>, Eric Edell<sup>6<\/sup>, Christopher Hartley<sup>5<\/sup>, Janani Reisenauer<sup>7<\/sup>, Nicholas Reder<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Alpenglow Biosciences, Inc., Seattle, WA,<sup>2<\/sup>Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN,<sup>3<\/sup>BioPharma Diagnostics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN,<sup>4<\/sup>Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and Thoracic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN,<sup>5<\/sup>Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN,<sup>6<\/sup>Pulmonary Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN,<sup>7<\/sup>Pulmonary Medicine and Thoracic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3370b91e-7562-403d-9116-948cd3f25bda","ControlNumber":"3989","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

With the idea that dissecting the evolutionary population dynamics leading to relapse would help explain treatment failure from a mechanistic standpoint, several studies have performed comparisons of genetic heterogeneity at diagnosis and relapse. These showed that as many as 70% of relapses are dominated by a single diagnostic subclone or one of its evolutionary progeny; leading to the prevailing view that treatment selection in cALL primarily operates at the genotype level. However, a crucial caveat of these studies is their reliance, due primarily to technical and economic constraints, on very limited data timepoints. While the dynamics linking said timepoints are often interpreted based on simple intuition. To overcome this sparse data challenge and reconstruct the entire spatial and temporal evolutionary trajectories of individual cALL cells from diagnosis to relapse, we have integrated experimental data with an <i>in silico<\/i> model. Single-cell WGS and RNAseq data were obtained from primary and xenografted leukemic cells before and after chemotherapy. These were then used to parameterize an agent-based mathematical model allowing tracking of the genotype and evolving phenotype of individual cells over time. When short treatment courses akin to those we delivered <i>in vivo<\/i> were used, the <i>in silico<\/i> model closely recapitulated the experimental results. Since cALL treatment lasts several years, it cannot be entirely modelled in vivo. Due to the rarity of post-treatment residual cells and the lack of universal cell surface markers to isolate them, direct analysis of clinical samples is also challenging. However, based on the initial treatment data, our calibrated model provided a unique opportunity to simulate longer remission-relapse dynamics of several leukemias. Mechanistic analysis of the collected data showed that, strikingly, in most cases, clonal dominance at relapse results from stochastic sweeps rather than deterministic differences in clonal fitness. Indeed, independent treatment of the same leukemia with an identical drug regimen more frequently ended with a considerably different clonal landscape (either polyclonal disease or a different dominant clone) than with the same outcome initially observed. Rather than genotype differences, the size of residual disease and a founder effect linked to the stochastic exit, post-treatment, of individual cells from quiescence were the key determinants of the relapse genetic landscape. Altogether, our data highlight the misinterpretation risk associated with snapshot analysis and might inform promising alternative treatment schedules.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++BCS02-05 Integrative cancer science,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Heterogeneity,Modeling,Leukemias: acute lymphoblastic,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Virginia Turati<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Javier Herrero<sup>2<\/sup>, Mark Robertson-Tessi<sup>1<\/sup>, Tariq Enver<sup>2<\/sup>, Andriy Marusyk<sup>1<\/sup>, Alexander RA Anderson<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>H.
