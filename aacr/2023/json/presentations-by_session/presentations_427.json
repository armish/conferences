[{"Abstract":"Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by clonal proliferation of malignant myeloid blasts in the bone marrow. We have recently reported that blocking B7-H3 using a novel monoclonal antibody (mAB), T-1A5 enhances natural killer (NK) cell mediated cytotoxicity against AML cells. IL-15 is an essential component for NK cell activity. Recombinant human IL-15 (rIL-15), however, degrades rapidly and therefore may provide a suboptimal stimulus to NK cells. Studies have shown that BCL2 inhibitor, venetoclax (ABT-199), enhances NK cell induced antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against cancer cells. However, the combined effect of B7-H3 blocking and BCL2 inhibition remains unexplored in AML. We hypothesized that blocking B7-H3 using T-1A5 in the presence of novel investigational polymer-engineered IL-15 receptor agonist, NKTR-255, and the BCL2 inhibitor synergistically induces NK cell mediated ADCC in AML cells.<br \/>Methods: CD16 and NKG2D activation markers measured by flow cytometry in AML patient and healthy donor derived NK cells. The NKTR-255 was used to generate NK cells, and their cytotoxicity was compared to that of NK cells generated with rIL-15 using IncuCyte. To investigate these NK cells&#8217; cytotoxic activity against AML cells, we treated B7-H3<sup>+<\/sup> AML cell lines (OCI-AML3 and MV4-11) with anti-B7-H3 chimeric mAb ChT-1A5 in the presence and absence of NK cells generated using NKTR-255 or rIL-15. To assess the potential synergy of BCL2 and B7-H3 in NK cell mediated anti-leukemic activity against AML cells, we treated B7-H3<sup>+<\/sup> cells with T-1A5 with or without ABT-199in the presence or absence of NK cells.<br \/>Results: The expression of NK cell activation markers were significantly lower in NK cells derived from AML patients than healthy donors. To assess the effect of NKTR-255 on NK cell activity, we generated NK cells using NKTR-255 and compared them with NK cells generated using rIL-15 using the standard 14-day culture protocol. We observed similar proliferation and NK cell numbers between NKTR-255 and rIL-15. However, NK cells stimulated with NKTR-255 showed significantly enhanced (more than 2-fold) cytolytic activity against B7-H3<sup>+<\/sup> AML cell lines compared with NK cells stimulated with rIL-15. Moreover, when combined with ChT-1A5, NKTR-255 significantly enhanced NK cell mediated ADCC activity in B7-H3<sup>+<\/sup> AML cells compared to rIL-15. Interestingly, we observed that the combination of T-1A5 and venetoclax synergistically induced an anti-leukemic effect in B7-H3<sup>+<\/sup> AML cell lines when compared with either drug alone or isotype IgG1 in a dose-dependent manner.<br \/>Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that blockade of the immune checkpoint protein, B7-H3 with the IL-15 receptor agonist, NKTR-255, or the BCL2 inhibitor, ABT-199, synergistically induces NK cell mediated cytotoxicity against B7-H3<sup>+<\/sup> AML cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Acute myeloid leukemia,B7-H3,BCL2 Inhibitor,ADCC,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Anudishi Tyagi<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, A.

Recently, kynurenine (Kyn), a tryptophan metabolite, has been identified as the most prominent endogenous ligand of AhR, which is constantly secreted into the tumor microenvironment by cancer cells via IDO1 and TDO2. As this secretion is known to cause a broad immunosuppression, AhR is considered to be a central mediator of suppressing immune responses, thereof, a novel target for cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we have discovered a novel small molecule AhR antagonist, DA-4505, and investigated whether it can pursue the restoration of functionally suppressed immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, then, achieve a consequent anti-tumor effect specifically via altering various aspects of tumor microenvironment. DA-4505, AhR antagonist, exhibited high potency (IC50=3 nM) and showed comparable antagonism to Compound B (an AhR antagonist drug candidate being studied in the clinical phase) in both human and mouse hepatocytes. Furthermore, DA-4505 showed superior alleviating activity on benzo[a]pyrene and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlordibenzodioxin (TCDD, an AhR ligand) induced CYP1A1 mRNA level compared to Compound B in mouse livers. Similarly, DA-4505 treatment presented comparable or even better recovery effect on TNF production under Kyn-induced immunosuppressive condition in monocytes of mouse and human compared to Compound B. DA-4505 dose-dependently enhanced activation of human CD8+ T cells comparable to Compound B and rescued IL-2 and IFN&#947; production under Kyn treated condition. Moreover, DA-4505 specifically polarized macrophages towards inflammatory macrophage phenotype (M1).Oral administration of DA-4505 induced a significant tumor growth inhibition in several murine syngeneic mouse models and was synergistic in combination with anti-PD1 antibody. DA-4505 enhanced the infiltration of M1-macrophage and CD8+ T cells while suppressed the infiltration of M2-macrophage and Treg, thus, presenting anti-tumor effect. Specifically, we confirmed that the anti-tumor effect of DA-4505 is CD8+ T cell-dependent by CD8+ T cell depleted MC38 mouse model. Taken together, our result showed that DA-4505, AhR antagonist, presented its anti-tumor effects in two distinctive but cooperative way into some extent. Firstly, DA-4505 activated stimulatory immune cells such as monocytes, dendritic cells (DC) and effector T cells. Secondly, DA-4505 reduced the immunosuppressive mechanisms by regulating Treg and M2-macrophage. Thus, our data demonstrate the potential of AhR as a promising therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy as well as proposing DA-4505 as a novel therapeutic agent for both mono and aPD-1 combinatory therapeutic scheme.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Aryl hydrocarbon receptor,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Daewon Cha<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Dajeong Kim<sup><\/sup>, Jongho Cho<sup><\/sup>, Chaelim Ryu<sup><\/sup>, Hyeon Uk Jeong<sup><\/sup>, Dae Young Lee<sup><\/sup>, Kyu-Hwan Kim<sup><\/sup>, Sunghwa Kim<sup><\/sup>, Jee-Heun Kim<sup><\/sup>, Taedong Han<sup><\/sup>, Hyounmie Doh<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Dong-A ST, Yongin-si, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"9b2f9116-5e68-4947-a9b2-2350b718be4e","ControlNumber":"4146","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

T-cell activation can be boosted by CEA-targeted CD28-costimulation (NILK-3301; signal 2). NILK-2401, carrying a fully effective IgG1 Fc, induces antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADCP) and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) of tumor cells by co-targeting CEA and the innate immune checkpoint CD47 (&#8220;don&#8217;t eat me&#8221; signal). We present here next generation immunotherapy to overcome limited single class activity in CEA-expressing solid cancers.<br \/>Methods: BsAbs were generated using LCB&#8217;s fully human &#954;&#955; body platform. TDCC, ADCP, and ADCC with human PBMC or monocyte-derived macrophages were assessed using CEA+ colorectal (n=3), lung (n=2), and gastric (n=2) cancer lines. Combination activity of NILK-2401 + NILK-2301 (&#177; NILK-3301) was assessed by flow cytometry. In vivo activity was tested in xenograft NOG or NSG\/human PMBC-, HIS-, and hSIRP&#945;\/hCD47\/hCD3\/hCD28 transgenic mice. Safety data include binding to other CEACAMs, cytokine release in whole blood, erythrophagocytosis, platelet activation, exclusion of superagonism (NILK-3301), as well as PK- and tolerability in cynomolgus monkeys and Tg32-mice.<br \/>Results: NILK-2301 induced dose-dependent killing of all tested cell lines, which was also visualized by live cell imaging. Combination of NILK-2301 (1 nM) + NILK-3301 vs. NILK-2301 alone (10 nM) increased TDCC (3-8-fold), T-cell activation (CD25, CD69, HLA-DR), cytokine secretion (interferon-&#947;, granzyme B, perforin), and CD4+\/CD8+ T-cell proliferation. NILK-2401 blocked CD47-SIRP&#945; interaction and induced ADCP\/ADCC-mediated elimination of all cell lines. NILK-2301 + NILK-2401 treatment increased maximum activity (Emax) and reduced necessary dose of the T-cell bsAb to reach Emax. E.g., Emax of 30% killing (NILK-2301 alone) was increased in combination with NILK-2401 at 0.1\/1\/10 &#181;g\/mL to 40%, 80%, and 80%. <i>In vivo,<\/i> NILK-2301 (10 mg\/kg IV, BIW) decreased tumor progression. NILK-2301\/-3301 combination induced tumor regression in 8\/8 mice. NILK-2401 delayed tumor growth vs. mean of control in 100% (15\/15) of mice and prevented establishment of detectable tumors (&#62;50mm<sup>3<\/sup>) in 53% (8\/15). Results of double and quadruple transgenic mice, including triple bsAb combinations, will be presented at the meeting. No relevant safety signals were detected.<br \/>Conclusions: NILK-2301 and NILK-2401 are active as single agents. Addition of NILK-2401 or NILK-3301 to NILK-2301 significantly increases activity, already at 10 -100x lower CEAxCD3 doses. GMP drug substance has been produced for NILK-2301 and NILK-2401.

Despite the clinical success of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in many malignancies including melanoma and small cell lung cancer, ICB has failed to demonstrate similar response in BLBCs, where most cases are highly infiltrated by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). There is increasing evidence that Notch is decisive in regulating intercellular communication in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). This includes the recruitment of TAMs which contribute to an immunosuppressive TIME, illuminating the potential of Notch-inhibition as adjuvant immunotherapy in BLBC. To examine the immune phenotype and therapeutic response of BLBC to combined Notch-inhibition and ICB, we employed an <i>in vivo <\/i>tumorgraft model using murine basal-like mammary tumor 4T1 cells. Briefly, tumor cells were orthotopically injected into the mammary fat pads of BALB\/c mice. Using a crossover design, mice were randomly allocated to treatment with either Notch inhibitor (&#947;-secretase inhibitor, LY411575), anti-PD1 (RMP1-14), or control treatment for 12-days (stage-1), followed by randomization to a second 12-day period (stage 2) with the same, or one of the other treatments. Results: Despite the low response rate of BLBC to ICB alone, Notch inhibition reduced TAMs and induced responsiveness to sequential ICB. This response was characterized by increased cytotoxic T lymphocytes (GrB+, CTL) infiltration of the primary tumor. Similar results were observed when Notch-regulated cytokines (IL-1&#946; and CCL2), crucial to TAM recruitment, were inhibited. Moreover, a more impressive therapeutic effect of sequential treatment was observed in lung metastasis, whereby TAM depletion and increased CTL infiltration were accompanied with near-complete abolition of metastases. Mechanistically, tumor cell Notch signaling upregulates a group of circulating cytokines including IL-1&#946; and CCL2, which prime the lung for metastases. Additionally, compared to primary tumor cells, PD ligand 1 is up-regulated in lung metastases, rendering them profoundly sensitive to sequential ICB treatment. These findings highlight the potential of sequential Notch inhibition and ICB as a novel immunotherapeutic strategy in BLBC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Notch,Immune checkpoint blockade,Interleukin-1,CCL2,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Qiang Shen<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kiichi Murakami<sup><\/sup>, Pamela Ohashi<sup><\/sup>, Michael Reedijk<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>UHN Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"7f71801d-0a96-4020-9921-2f4cc1616b29","ControlNumber":"4093","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Q.

Celularity Inc. has developed an allogenic, off-the-shelf and cryopreserved human placental CD34<sup>+<\/sup> derived natural killer (CYNK-001) cell therapy as potential treatment for GBM. NK cell-derived exosomes are notable for their anti-tumor activity. Exosomes have been demonstrated their ability to pass through blood-brain barrier in vivo. We hypothesized that engineering exosomes to deliver TGF-&#946; short interfering RNA (siRNA) would reduce TFG-&#946; expression, thus enhance the anti-tumor activity of CYNK-001 against GBM cells. This study aims to investigate if (i) CYNK-001-derived exosomes (CYNK-Exo) have anti-tumor effects against GBM, (ii) CYNK-Exo loaded with TGF-&#946; siRNA (siCYNK-Exo) can effectively knockdown TGF-&#946; expression in tumor cells, and (iii) siCYNK-Exo and CYNK-001 have a synergistic effect against GBM cells.<br \/>Methods: CYNK-Exo were isolated from CYNK-001 conditioned media by one-step sucrose cushion ultracentrifugation and characterized by nano-tracking analysis (NTA) and on-bead flow cytometry. Cytotoxicity of CYNK-Exo against tumor cells was measured by real-time impedance-based xCELLigence assay. To measure uptake of siRNA, Cy3-tagged siRNA was loaded into CYNK-Exo and quantified by flow cytometry. Knockdown of TGF-&#946; was measured by RT-qPCR and ELISA.<br \/>Results: CYNK-Exo showed a median size of 117.4 nm by NTA and expressed the exosomal-characteristic CD9 and CD81, as well as NK cell-characteristic CD56, CD226 and CD11a biomarkers. CYNK-Exo displayed cytotoxicity against GBM cell line U251 in a time- and dose- dependent manner. U251 cells treated with siCYNK-Exo showed efficient uptake with 97.7% Cy3<sup>+<\/sup> cells. RT-qPCR results demonstrated 78.6% reduction in TGF-&#946; mRNA expression and ELISA results demonstrated 71.8% reduction in TGF-&#946; secretion. Similar findings were demonstrated on LN-229 GBM cell line. To test if knocking down TGF-&#946; could reduce tumor immunosuppression, U251 cells were treated with siCYNK-Exo followed by CYNK-001. Enhanced cytotoxicity against U251 was demonstrated with combination treatment when compared to that with CYNK-001 alone: 73.9% vs. 36.5% respectively. Compared to CYNK-001 alone, combination siCYNK-Exo and CYNK-001 treatment not only increased the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines GM-CSF, IFN-&#947;, and TNF-&#945; by CYNK-001 cells, but also enhanced the production of perforin, granzyme A and granzyme B, which are typically inhibited in NK cells by TGF-&#946;.<br \/>Conclusion: Our results demonstrated anti-tumor activity of CYNK-Exo against GBM cells; efficient TGF-&#946; knockdown in GBM cells by siCYNK-Exo; and synergistic anti-tumor activity of<br \/>TGF-&#946; siCYNK-Exo in combination with CYNK-001 against GBM cells.

Still, many patients do not respond or relapse following PD-1 blockade. Tumor-promoting inflammation, such as that mediated by the pleiotropic cytokine interleukin 1 beta (IL-1B), fosters immunosuppression in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Our group and others showed that IL-1B blockade inhibits lung cancer development. We thus hypothesized that addition of IL-1B blockade to anti-PD-1 treatment may enhance outcomes against LUAD. Using a human-relevant, tobacco-associated, mouse model of LUAD development, we compared the effects of combined PD-1 and IL-1B blockade relative to treatment with single-agents (anti-IL-1B or anti-PD-1) and control antibody on early lung tumor development and the TIME. Drugs (anti-PD-1 + anti-IL-1B, anti-PD-1, anti-IL-1B, control IgG) were administered at end of exposure to the tobacco-specific carcinogen NNK, to evaluate effects on formation of early lesions (preventive), or at 3 months post-NNK (prophylactic) to interrogate LUAD development (8 groups). Comprehensive interrogation of the lung ecosystem and the TIME was performed using deep single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis in a subset of the mice (n = 3 to 4) from each of the 8 groups (n = 31 total; 143,897 cells after stringent quality control). Mice treated with combined PD-1 and IL-1B blockade displayed reduced development of lung tumors when compared to animals treated with anti-IL-1B, anti-PD-1, or control antibodies. Fractions of cytotoxic <i>Cd8<\/i>+ T cells were conspicuously higher and those of tumor cells and exhausted <i>Cd8<\/i>+ T cells evidently lower in lungs of mice treated with combined PD-1 and IL-1B blockade relative to monotherapy- or control antibody-treated animals. <i>Igha<\/i>+ plasma cells were strikingly highest in lungs of mice treated with combined PD-1 and IL-1B blockade and nearly absent in monotherapy- and control-treated groups. Lungs of mice treated with combined PD-1 and IL-1B blockade showed higher fractions of <i>Cd80+\/Cd86<\/i>+ memory B cells and, consistently, T follicular helper T cells, while exhibiting reduced fractions of na&#239;ve B and <i>Cd24a<\/i>+\/<i>Tgfb1<\/i>+ B cells suggestive of enhanced activation of B cell responses by the combinatorial treatment. These effects were, overall, present, or much more pronounced, in animals that were prophylactically treated. Flow cytometry analysis of lung tissues and immune profiling of bronchioalveolar lavage fluid overall confirmed augmented immune cell responses by combined PD-1 and IL-1B blockade. Our findings show that blocking IL-1B synergizes with anti-PD-1 in regression of early tumor cells and reversal of immunosuppression. Combined blockade of PD-1 and IL-1B may be a promising strategy for early treatment of lung cancer that warrants further clinical studies.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Interleukin-1,Combination therapy,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Warapen Treekitkarnmongkol<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Guangchun Han<sup>1<\/sup>, Zahraa Rahal<sup>1<\/sup>, Jiping Feng<sup>1<\/sup>, Ansam Sinjab<sup>1<\/sup>, Tina Cascone<sup>1<\/sup>, Christopher  S.

Recently, several clinical trials have reported benefits using immunotherapy to treat brain metastasis. However, variability of the responses is broad and high benefit is found mainly in asymptomatic brain metastasis, while the benefit is dramatically reduced in the clinically relevant stage. Thus, it is currently unknown how to effectively target symptomatic brain metastases with immunotherapy. We previously reported a clinically relevant protumoral program driven by STAT3 activation in a subpopulation of reactive astrocytes in these advanced stages of the disease. Our current study further exploited the heterogeneity within the metastasis-associated microenvironment as a resource to identify novel therapeutic vulnerabilities to improve the benefits of immunotherapies based on immune checkpoint blocking antibodies (ICB) in symptomatic brain metastasis.<br \/>Our results demonstrate that reactive astrocytes are strong immunomodulatory cells in brain tumors. We have identified the molecular profile of disease-associated glial cells and defined its connection to modulatory activities on specific lymphocyte populations in experimental brain metastasis as well as human-derived samples. scRNASeq and high content multiplex immunofluorescence allowed us to report a novel local immunomodulatory axis dependent on TIMP1 (astrocytes)\/CD63 (CD8 T cells), which is present in brain metastasis patients with high immunoscore and would imply an additional immunosuppressive signal for potential ICB responders in brain metastasis.<br \/>Genetic and pharmacologic approaches targeting this STAT3-dependent local immunomodulatory axis have allowed us to define the rationale to combine immune checkpoint blockade with a STAT3 inhibitor, which we previously used in patients. We proved that such combined immunotherapy boost the systemic activation of T cells while also preventing the local blockade. Additionally, our comprehensive strategy includes the possibility to stratify patients that are best qualified to benefit from this therapy by measuring TIMP1 in liquid biopsies from CSF. Even more, our data using Patient Derived Organotypic Cultures (PDOC) from fresh brain metastasis neurosurgeries confirms that our therapeutic strategy might benefit brain metastases generated from any primary source.<br \/>In conclusion, we describe an immunosuppressive mechanism in the brain microenvironment that could explain the lack of response to ICB in patients with advanced brain metastasis. Our finding provides the rationale to implement complementary approaches targeting local immunosuppression to increase the benefit of immunotherapy in symptomatic brain metastasis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Brain metastasis,Microenvironment,Immunomodulation,TIMP,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Neibla Priego<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Pedro García-Gómez<sup>1<\/sup>, Ana de Pablos-Aragoneses<sup>1<\/sup>, María Perea-García<sup>1<\/sup>, Laura Álvaro-Espinosa<sup>1<\/sup>, Carolina Hernández-Oliver<sup>1<\/sup>, Elena Martínez-Saez<sup>2<\/sup>, Ángel Pérez-Núñez<sup>3<\/sup>, Aurelio Hernández-Laín<sup>3<\/sup>, Rebeca Sanz-Pamplona<sup>4<\/sup>, Marc Schmitz<sup>5<\/sup>, Stephen  J.

Our lab has investigated the use of a next-generation IL-2 compound, murine PD1-IL2v, which consists of an anti-PD-1 antibody fused to a IL2-variant with abolished binding to IL2R&#945;. Previous work shows this molecule results in tumor-antigen specific T cell expansion and differentiation towards immune effectors. Here, we report for the first time that radiation therapy amplifies the anti-tumor effect observed with PD1-IL2v treatment of murine orthotopic models of local tumor growth and metastasis. This anti-tumor effect is correlated with increases in proliferative and polyfunctional CD8 T cells across tumor, lymph node, and blood compartments. Furthermore, using an OVA-antigen specific orthotopic model, we found that radiation in combination with PD1-IL2v treatment enhances infiltration and activation of antigen-specific CD8 T cells, which have been shown to be critical for immunotherapy clinical success. A portion of tumor-bearing mice treated with radiation and PD1-IL2v fully eradicated their primary tumors and tumor rechallenges, which we show correlates with increased markers of memory in CD8 T cells of these mice. To demonstrate the clinical relevance of these preclinical findings, we performed RNA sequencing on paired pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patient tumor tissue samples prior to and following radiation. We observed enhanced IL2R&#946; and IL2R&#947; expression as well as IL2R signaling in PDAC-patient responders to radiation therapy compared to non-responders. In conclusion, the antigen-specific, lasting memory response to preclinical PDAC models demonstrated here provides rationale for the treatment of PDAC with a radiation and PD1-IL2v combination.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Cytotoxic T lymphocytes,Antigen specific T cell,Immune Memory,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maureen Hoen<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Miles Piper<sup>1<\/sup>, Laurel  B.

The AhR exerts important immunosuppressive functions by activating Treg cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells and repressing CD8<sup>+<\/sup> effector T cells. Here, we propose that a best-in-class AhR inhibitor, DA-4505, improves anti-tumor efficacy via modulation of tumor immune surveillance compared to BAY2416964, an AHR antagonist drug candidate being studied in the clinical phase.<br \/>Methods: To evaluate anti-tumor effects of DA-4505 and BAY2416964, the two AhR inhibitors were dosed at 10 mg\/kg once daily alone or in combination with aPD-1 (10 mg\/kg) in surgical and chemotherapy models, and a PDX model (YHIM2004). Tumor volume, relapse, and survival were evaluated, and immune profiles were analyzed with IHC, flow cytometry, and scRNAseq.<br \/>Results: A significant tumor reduction appeared in the CT26 and 4T1 tumor models after the DA-4505 treatment compared to vehicle group (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.05). In contrast, DA-4505 treatment did not induce significant tumor regression compared to vehicle group in tumor-bearing NOG mice, suggesting that anti-tumor effects of DA-4505 were driven by immunologic mechanisms. To evaluate the role of DA-4505 in conjunction with surgery, DA-4505 alone or in combination with anti-PD-1 was given prior to and following resection of the tumors in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. Survival of mice treated with DA-4505 alone or DA-4505 combined with anti-PD-1 was significantly prolonged after resection compared to aPD-1 treatment group (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.05). In addition, there were four mice that did not have a relapse by treating DA-4505 with or without aPD-1 after surgery (4\/5). A tumor regression also appeared in the YHIM2004-engrafted humanized mouse study. A tumor reduction was shown by treating DA-4505 alone or in combination with pembrolizumab compared to vehicle group (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.05). Next, we co-administered an AhR inhibitor and aPD-1 as a partner to improve the antitumor effects of chemotherapy. The DA-4505 add-on group showed tumor regression when compared with the combination therapy group treated with aPD-1 and chemotherapy (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.0001). In addition, a significant increase in survival rate was shown in the group treated with a DA-4505 add-on compared to vehicle group (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.001). Analysis of scRNAseq showed that M1 macrophage expressing CCL7 and CCL8 were increased in DA-4505 treated group compared to the vehicle and aPD-1 groups.

Immunotherapy has helped to increase the survival of NSCLC patients, but the therapeutic response is limited to 23-26% of patients. While many factors impact immunotherapy failure, we have focused on a few, (<b>a<\/b>) heterogeneous expression of immune checkpoints (ICs) limiting the use of single immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) for everyone, (<b>b<\/b>) additional ICs responsible for blocking innate immune system and lack of antigen presentation to the T cells, and (<b>c<\/b>) lack of rationally designed combination therapies.Commonly used immunotherapies for NSCLC block PD1-PDL1 interaction, but the majority of the NSCLC patient does not have high PDL1 expression indicating PD1-PDL1 as a subsidiary mode of immune evasion. So, it is necessary to include additional ICIs in order to achieve adequate objective response in all NSCLC patients. In order to investigate the immune checkpoint expression, we screened several NSCLC patient-derived tumor tissues, and only 33% of them showed high expression of PDL1, whereas 64.6% of patients had high CD47 expression. CD47, an innate immune regulator, is overexpressed in lung cancer cells and delivers an &#8220;<i>eat-me-not<\/i>&#8221; signal by binding to signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRP&#945;) in macrophage resulting in diminishing phagocytosis and antigen presentation to the T cells.Combining anticancer drugs with immunotherapy agents has become a popular approach to achieve a less toxic and long-acting objective therapeutic response. Here, we introduce antibody conjugated drug loaded nanotherapeutics (ADNs) consisting of a targeted therapy drug, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor PI103, and decorated with two ICIs for CD47 and PDL1. The ADN particles have been designed based on classical liposomal supramolecular nanoparticles followed by surface functionalization by the specific antibody. The anti-CD47-PDL1-ADN has shown increased cellular internalization and delivery of PI103 than IgG-ADN and anti-PDL1-ADN. The anti-CD47-PDL1-ADN showed low hematotoxicity and higher cell-killing potency for the cancer cells. The bispecific anti-CD47-PDL1-ADNs can block PD1-PDL1 and SIRP&#945;-CD47 immune checkpoint interaction, activating both the innate (macrophage) and adaptive (T cells) immune responses. Reduced tumor growth and higher survival probability have been observed in the syngeneic LLC tumor model for anti-CD47-PDL1-ADN than monotherapy and traditional immunotherapy.<i>In summary,<\/i> we have introduced a lung cancer treatment strategy that can be an effective therapy for NSCLC patients, irrespective of the PDL1 expression level. The strategy combining bispecific immunotherapy and targeted therapy for activating the innate and adaptive immune systems and delivering targeted therapy drugs can emerge as a significant advance in the treatment of NSCLC patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Combination therapy,NSCLC,Targeted therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tanmoy Saha<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Shiladitya Sengupta<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hoapital, Cambridge, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1c74971b-2bd8-4bcc-bfbc-8089fcbc6f13","ControlNumber":"6279","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that the efficacy of anti-PD1+anti-LAG3 may be equivalent to anti-PD1+anti-CTLA4. The goal of our project is to understand the mechanisms of action and resistance to anti-PD1+anti-LAG3 in mouse model of melanoma brain metastases. We used orthotopic syngeneic mouse model in which SM1 and B16100kVII2 cells are injected stereotactically into the brain and into the flank. The mice were treated with anti-PD1+anti-LAG3 and anti-PD1+anti-CTLA4 every 5 days. Single cell RNA-seq platform was used to determine the impact of both the combination therapies upon each individual cell type. Flow cytometry experiments were carried out to assess the percentage of immune cells recruitment. The <i>in vivo<\/i> studies demonstrated that the anti-PD1+anti-CTLA4 had similar efficacy to anti-PD1+anti-LAG3 at both cranial and extracranial sites over a period of 80 days in the SM1 model. In the less responsive B16100kVII2 model, anti-PD1+anti-LAG3 was initially less effective, but similar numbers of mice failed both each combination. scRNA-seq and IHC analysis of responding tumors showed that the anti-PD1+anti-LAG3 led to a greater accumulation of B cells, DCs, CD4+ T cells and different subsets of CD8+ T cells. Of note, the anti-PD1+anti-CTLA4 was associated with infiltration of Tregs, whereas the anti-PD1+anti-LAG3 was associated with CD4+ Th1 helper cells. Depletion of CD4+ T cells decreased responses to anti-PD1+anti-LAG3 in both the cranial and extracranial tumors, with no change in the magnitude of response to the anti-PD1+ anti-CTLA4. By contrast, depletion of CD8+ T cells suppressed responses to both combinations. Depletion of CD4+ T cells decreased activated CD8+ T cells by 30% in anti-PD1+anti-LAG3 treated tumors and conversely increased numbers of activated CD8+ T cells by 40 % in anti-PD1+anti-CTLA4 tumors. In anti-PD1+ anti-LAG3 treated tumors, T helper function was directed towards CD8+ T cells and not B cells, with B cell depletion impacting responses to both combination immunotherapies in a similar manner. Analysis of relapsing brain tumors from both anti-PD1+anti-LAG3 treated mice showed an increased association of MDSCs and loss of tumor reactive CD8+ T cells. The anti-PD1+anti-LAG3+anti-CTLA4 triplet had a good efficacy and suppressed the growth of both flank and brain tumors over a period of 35 days, an effect associated with increased CD8+ T cell infiltration and reduced numbers of MDSCs and Tregs.We show that anti-PD1+anti-LAG3 can drive CD4+ Th1 T helper cell responses hence increasing the accumulation of effector CD8+ T cells and B cells in melanoma and melanoma brain metastases, improving the durability of response. The triplet combination maximizes the efficacy and duration of response in treatment of melanoma brain metastases.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Metastasis,LAG3,Melanoma\/skin cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Manali S.

The efficacy of NIR-PIT is synergistically enhanced by combining immune activating agents including immune checkpoint inhibitors and cytokines. However, there are still needs for improving the efficacy of NIR-PIT. A recent study showed that cytokines could exert strong anti-cancer effects when administered locally. Interleukin-15 (IL-15) elicits immune responses that include the generation and persistence of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that local IL-15 administration combined with cancer cell-targeted NIR-PIT could be a highly effective therapy. The efficacy of IL-15 was evaluated by intratumorally or intraperitoneally injecting 5 &#956;g of human IL-15 in C57BL\/6 mice inoculated s.c. with murine colon cancer MC38 cells. Human IL-15-secreting MC38 (hIL-15-MC38) was constructed by introducing human IL-15-coding plasmids into MC38 cells and the efficacy of CD44-targeted NIR-PIT was compared in vitro and in vivo. The efficacy of intratumoral IL-15 injection combined with CD44-targeted NIR-PIT was also evaluated in MC38 tumor models. Moreover, bilateral tumor models were used to analyze whether local IL-15 administration combined with CD44-targeted NIT-PIT could induce abscopal effects in untreated tumors. Intratumoral IL-15 injection significantly suppressed tumor growth and induced immune activities compared with intraperitoneal injection. Both hIL-15-MC38 and parental MC38 cells had high CD44 expression on their cell surface and in vitro NIR-PIT induced rapid cell death in both two cell lines. When hIL-15-MC38 or MC38 tumor-bearing mice were treated with or without NIR-PIT, hIL-15-MC38 tumor-bearing mice treated with NIR-PIT showed the best tumor growth inhibition and survival. The hIL-15-MC38 tumors treated with NIR-PIT showed significant increases in the cell number\/g tumor of CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and natural killer T cells, and significantly higher Granzyme B expression in these cells compared with the control MC38 tumors. Similar results were observed in vivo by intratumoral IL-15 injection combined with NIR-PIT. Moreover, in bilateral tumor models with right hIL-15-MC38 and left MC38 tumors, NIR-PIT against right hIL-15-MC38 tumors significantly suppressed the growth of left untreated MC38 tumors. In conclusion, local IL-15 administration combined with CD44-targeted NIR-PIT promoted anti-cancer immune responses, resulting in the inhibition of growth of treated tumors, longer survival of mice, and abscopal effects in untreated tumors. Thus, locally administered IL-15 is a promising anti-cancer therapy in combination with cancer cell-targeted NIR-PIT.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Molecular targets,Preclinical,Combination therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hiroshi Fukushima<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Aki Furusawa<sup><\/sup>, Takuya Kato<sup><\/sup>, Seiichiro Takao<sup><\/sup>, Shuhei Okuyama<sup><\/sup>, Peter  L.

Gemcitabine has been the cornerstone in PDA treatment, yet its efficacy remains limited. Over the past decades, extensive investigations suggested a role of tumor microenvironment (TME) in rendering PDA resistance to gemcitabine, however, its underlying mechanism remained largely unknown. Cellular profiling has revealed the macrophages as a major immune cell component of PDA-TME. Our recent study showed that the expression of the homeobox protein VentX, a master regulator of macrophage plasticity, is significantly down-regulated in tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) of PDA. We demonstrated that restoration of VentX expression in PDA-TAMs polarizes the TAMs from a pro-tumor M2-like phenotype to an anti-tumor M1-like phenotype. We showed further that VentX-regulated-TAMs (VentX-TAMs) revert immune suppression of PDA-TME by inhibiting CD4 Treg differentiation and by promoting CD8 proliferation and activation. Using a newly developed tumor immune microenvironment-enabling model system (TIME-EMS), we showed that VentX-TAMs drastically promote efficacy of gemcitabine against PDA for about 4-fold but not cytotoxicity on normal pancreatic tissue. As such, our data suggested a function of VentX-TAMs to promote chemosensitivity of gemcitabine and to improve PDA prognosis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor associated macrophages,VentX,Pancreatic cancer,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Joanna Le<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Hong Gao<sup>2<\/sup>, Yi Le<sup>3<\/sup>, William Richards<sup>4<\/sup>, Scott Radig<sup>5<\/sup>, Ronald Bleday<sup>4<\/sup>, Thomas Clancy<sup>4<\/sup>, Zhenglun Zhu<sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester, MA,<sup>2<\/sup>Medicine, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA,<sup>3<\/sup>Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA,<sup>4<\/sup>Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA,<sup>5<\/sup>Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e288ebe1-6957-4e12-91e4-ac8ab77c9e0a","ControlNumber":"2546","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Furthermore, we have demonstrated that NSAIDs could be used in combination with vaccination to even further reduce the development of intestinal polyps. We questioned what tissue specific biomarkers could define the efficacy of response with the combination treatment. APC(Min\/+) male and female mice (4-6 weeks old) were immunized with a multi-antigen (EGFR, COX2, CDC25B) peptide vaccine with CFA\/IFA as an adjuvant. Control mice received immune adjuvant alone. Regular chow or chow containing 400 ppm naproxen was provided intermittently (3 weeks on, 3 weeks off for 3 cycles) or continuously (18 weeks on) at the initiation of the vaccine regimen. Animals were euthanized at 22 weeks and tumors quantified. TIL were evaluated by flow cytometry. Since intermittent naproxen treatment was just as effective at inhibiting tumor development as continuous naproxen treatment, with or without vaccine, we did not differentiate between NSAID regimens. We observed an increase in CD8+ (83%; p&#60;0.0001), Tbet+CD4+ (94%; p&#60;0.001), effector memory (EM) CD4+ (76%; p&#60;0.0001) and EM CD8+ (94%; p&#60;0.0001) TIL in the tumors that did develop in the mice treated with the combination NSAID and vaccination as compared to control.

This combination has been approved for advanced melanoma, metastatic colon cancer and others. However, combination therapy with anti-PD-1\/CTLA-4 antibodies results in serious immune related adverse events (irAEs), presenting an obstacle for effective treatment with combination systemic anti-PD-1\/CTLA-4. Intratumoral (IT) immunotherapy is a strategy to enhance local activity while decreasing systemic irAEs. While clinical testing of IT antibodies is underway, antibodies' high molecular weight may limit their local diffusion and retention time within tumors. RNAi is an emerging therapeutic modality well-suited for local clinical application of ICI. We have demonstrated that self-delivering RNAi therapeutics built on proprietary INTASYL&#8482; technology specifically silence their targets in tissues without need for specialized formulations or delivery systems, and convey robust antitumor efficacy in vivo. Furthermore, multiple INTASYL compounds can be easily co-formulated into a multi-targeting therapeutic, providing specific silencing of multiple therapeutic targets in a single injection. Here, we present proof-of-concept (POC) in vivo data demonstrating synergistic efficacy of a novel INTASYL dual-targeting murine PD-1 (mPH-762) and CTLA-4 (27790) coformulation in PBS in a syngeneic CT26 model of murine colon cancer. Dual on-target silencing was first validated in murine T cells in vitro. In vivo, CT26 cells were implanted subcutaneously into female BALB\/c mice. Vehicle (PBS) or INTASYL IT treatment commenced when tumors reached a mean threshold volume (150 mm<sup>3<\/sup>; Day 1) with doses given on Days 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13. Mice received a total 1 mg\/dose with the dual-targeting INTASYL, comprised of 0.5 mg of each compound. Another group received the dual-targeting INTASYL at 2 mg\/dose. Tumor volumes and body weights were recorded longitudinally and analyzed by area under the curve (AUC). Tumors were isolated on Day 15 and mechanistic immunomodulation of the tumor microenvironment (TME) was assessed by flow cytometry. IT INTASYL dual-targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4 elicited robust dose-associated antitumor efficacy that was superior to the identical total dose of either single-targeting INTASYL, when comparing mean tumor volume AUC, demonstrating antitumor synergy by the dual-targeting coformulation. On-target mechanistic immunomodulatory effects were observed in the TME. These data demonstrate POC synergistic efficacy of IT INTASYL dual-targeting CTLA-4\/PD-1 in vivo, supporting further development to maximize efficacy and minimize irAEs. PH-762 is currently under clinical investigation in a Phase 1b study for advanced melanoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,RNAi,Combination therapy,In vivo,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Benjamin G.

We reported that the disialoganglioside GD2 is highly expressed on BCSCs and that targeting GD2 with dinutuximab (chimeric anti-GD2 antibody) in combination with NK cells synergistically reduced tumor volumes in TNBC animal models. Here, we hypothesize that naxitamab targets GD2<sup>+<\/sup> BCSCs and inhibits breast cancer (BC) growth by enhancing macrophage mediated phagocytosis and T cell mediated cytotoxicity. In addition, we explore whether addition of an investigational polymer-engineered IL-15 receptor-agonist, NKTR-255 treated NK cells, can further enhance this anti-GD2 mediated anti-cancer activity.<br \/>Methods: Naxitamab is a US FDA approved fully humanized anti-GD2 (hu3F8) monoclonal antibody for the treatment of pediatric neuroblastoma. We evaluated the effects of naxitamab treatment on macrophage mediated phagocytosis of BC cells using the live cell imaging system, IncuCyte<sup>&#174;<\/sup>. Next, we compared the effects of NKTR-255 treated NK cells with recombinant human IL-15 (rIL-15) treated NK cells in naxitamab induced ADCC in GD2<sup>+<\/sup> BC cells. We also performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) to examine GD2 expression and correlate it with T cell infiltration in primary TNBC patient samples with high and low GD2 levels. The effect of naxitamab treatment on T cell mediated cytotoxicity in BC cells was also observed.<br \/>Results: When compared to control, naxitamab treatment promoted macrophage mediated phagocytosis of Hs578T and HCC1395 cells in a dose dependent manner <i>(p &#60;0.001)<\/i>. Additionally, when co-cultured with healthy donor derived macrophages, we found a significant reduction in Hs578T spheroids treated with naxitamab in comparison to IgG control <i>(p&#60;0.001)<\/i>.

However, only a minority of patients with advanced disease benefit from this approach. We have recently showed that inflammasome unleashing by inhibition of the intracellular cation channel TMEM176B with Boritinib (BayK8644) augments anti-PD-1 efficacy. However, the mechanisms involved were not completely understood. We hypothesized that inflammasome activation triggered by Boritinib may recruit Th17 cells to modulate CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell exhaustion. To test this hypothesis, we have analyzed Th17 cells and subsets of exhausted CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the tumor microenvironment of WT mice treated with anti-PD1 &#177; Boritinib. Combining Boritinib with anti-PD-1 led to an increased frequency of Th17 cells in the tumor microenvironment compared to anti-PD-1 alone. Furthermore, CD73 expression was down-regulated whereas IFN-&#947; was up-regulated in Th17 cells in the tumor microenvironment of Boritinib + anti-PD-1 treated mice, suggesting an effector phenotype of these cells. In addition, combination of anti-PD-1 with Boritinib results in an increased frequency of progenitor exhausted CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells (CD44<sup>+<\/sup>PD-1<sup>+<\/sup>TCF1<sup>+<\/sup>TOX<sup>+<\/sup>) and transitory exhausted CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells (CD44<sup>+<\/sup>PD-1<sup>+<\/sup>TCF1<sup>-<\/sup>TOX<sup>-<\/sup>CX3CR1<sup>+<\/sup>) in the tumor microenvironment compared to anti-PD-1 alone. Similar results were obtained using <i>Tmem176b<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice treated with anti-PD-1, suggesting an on-target effect of Boritinib. To assess a potential role of Th17 cells in the anti-tumor immunity triggered by Boritinib + anti-PD-1, we treated WT and <i>Il17a<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice. We found that <i>Il17<\/i> is necessary for the anti-tumor effect of Boritinib + anti-PD-1, since <i>Il17a<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice showed a reduced overall survival compared to WT mice. Under this combined therapy, IL-17 may impact on exhausted CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells subsets since we found that transitory and terminally exhausted CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in the tumor microenvironment of <i>Il17a<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice had less granzyme B than in WT mice. To directly show the role of Th17 cells in the anti-PD-1 anti-tumor immunity we adoptively transferred <i>in vitro<\/i> differentiated effector Th17 cells. Adoptive transfer of effector Th17 cells into tumor-bearing mice treated with anti-PD-1 resulted in better survival than mice treated with anti-PD-1 alone. To characterize the downstream mechanisms, we performed an <i>in vivo <\/i>cytotoxicity assay. We found that mice adoptively transferred with effector Th17 cells exhibited greater cytotoxicity by CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells than mice treated with anti-PD-1 alone. Furthermore, this could be explained by an increased frequency in progenitor exhausted CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Thus, effector Th17 cells potentiate CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells on anti-PD-1 treatment. In conclusion, combination of anti-PD-1 with Boritinib augments the efficacy of the former by unleashing the inflammasome which results in an increased frequency of Th17 cells leading to modulation of exhausted CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Inflammation,Immunotherapy,Immune checkpoint blockade,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sofia Russo<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Mateo Malcuori<sup><\/sup>, David Charbonnier<sup><\/sup>, Mercedes Segovia<sup><\/sup>, Marcelo Hill<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Institut Pasteur De Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2baabfad-11ca-4993-8d79-cce4f01adb9e","ControlNumber":"3858","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

However, the clinical efficacy of these combinations in solid tumors has shown to be negligible. Our group has demonstrated that the epigenetic drug CM272, which targets DNMT and G9a, induces synergistic responses in combination with proapoptotic drugs in hematological malignancies (Cancer Discovery 2021). We have also reported that CM272 induces an immunogenic cell death that sensitizes tumor cells to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) (Nature Medicine 2020). Here, we hypothesized that CM272 in combination with proapoptotic drugs may sensitize tumor cells to ICB, resulting in profound anti-tumor responses. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated <i>in vitro<\/i> the sensitivity of cancer cells to different combinations of epigenetic and proapoptotic drugs. The most efficient combination was tested in various immunocompetent mouse models, followed by an immunophenotypic characterization of the tumor microenvironment. We found that CM272 in combination with inhibitors of BCL-XL, BCL2 or MCL1, yielded synergistic <i>in vitro<\/i> responses in a large collection of human and mouse cell lines derived from solid tumors. Mechanistically, the treatments induced the expression of endogenous retroelements\/retroviruses, which led to the activation of RIG-1 and MDA5 viral sensors, ATP hydrolysis and tumor cell death. Remarkably, we found that CM272 in combination with BCL-XL inhibition had more potent anti-tumor effects than that found with BCL2 or MCL1 inhibitors. <i>In vivo<\/i>, the triple combination CM272, A1331852 (BCL-XL inhibitor) and an anti-PD-1 moAb significantly reduced tumor growth and increased overall survival in three subcutaneous lung cancer models (LLC, 393P, Lacun-3) in comparison to double treatments. Moreover, this triple combination also induced significant anti-tumor responses in subcutaneous mouse models of colon cancer (MC38) and melanoma (B16), as well as in orthotopic models of lung cancer (LLC), glioblastoma (CT-2A) and breast cancer (ANV5), leading to prolonged survival and cure in a fraction of animals. The triple therapy was associated with a significant increase in the ratio of CD8 T versus immunosuppressive Treg cells, and M1 versus M2 macrophages. In conclusion, we report a novel regimen combining a dual epigenetic inhibitor, an anti-BCL-XL, and an anti-PD-1 moAb that results in potent responses in multiple pre-clinical models of solid tumors. The mechanisms underneath the antitumor responses include the modulation of the energy metabolism in tumor cells, leading to cell death boosted by an anti-BCL-XL pro-apoptotic drug, along with fostering the immune system to generate an efficient anti-tumor response assisted by ICB. This study reveals the potential of epigenetic therapeutics to treat and cure patients with solid tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Solid tumors,Epigenetics,Bcl-xL,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yaiza Senent<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Vicente Fresquet<sup>1<\/sup>, Victoria Jimenez<sup>1<\/sup>, Karmele Valencia<sup>1<\/sup>, Ana Remirez<sup>1<\/sup>, Francisco Exposito<sup>2<\/sup>, Marisol Gonzalez-Huarriz<sup>1<\/sup>, Borja Ruiz-Fernandez de Cordoba<sup>1<\/sup>, Haritz Moreno<sup>1<\/sup>, Daniel Ajona<sup>1<\/sup>, Marta M Alonso<sup>1<\/sup>, Fernando Lecanda<sup>1<\/sup>, Antonio Pineda-Lucena<sup>1<\/sup>, Felipe Prosper<sup>1<\/sup>, Alfonso Calvo<sup>1<\/sup>, Jose Angel Martinez-Climent<sup>1<\/sup>, Ruben Pio<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA)-University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain,<sup>2<\/sup>Yale School of Medicine, Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"65401c6a-a721-491f-96e3-cdf1b4513351","ControlNumber":"3360","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.

However, only a small subset of patients benefits from the treatment and most responders develop acquired resistance thereafter. One of the resistance mechanisms is beta-2-microglobulin (&#946;2M) mutation mediated dysfunction of MHC-I antigen presentation, which contributes to attenuation of cellular cytotoxicity triggered by adaptive CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Activating innate immunity, such as natural killer (NK) cells, can be used as a strategy to circumvent the attenuation. Immune-stimulating agents like Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonists and Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7\/8 agonists can elicit NK cell-mediated tumor rejection in preclinical tumor models, independent of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Thus, to evaluate novel therapeutic strategies overcoming anti-PD-1 resistance, we established a MC38-OVA-&#946;2M KO tumor model.<br \/>Methods: We knocked out &#946;2M genes in a murine MC38-OVA colorectal cancer cell line using CRISPR\/Cas9 to generate MC38-OVA-&#946;2M KO cells. &#946;2M knockout was verified by western blot and flow cytometry. For <i>in vitro<\/i> testing, both MC38-OVA and MC38-OVA-&#946;2M KO cells were treated with IFN-&#945;, IFN-&#946; and IFN-&#947; for 24h, and then MHC-I and OVA peptide SIINFEKL expression were analyzed by flow cytometry. For <i>in vivo <\/i>testing, 1&#215;10<sup>6<\/sup> MC38-OVA cells and MC38-OVA-&#946;2M KO cells were subcutaneously injected into C57BL\/6 mice and the models were treated with anti-PD-1. Finally, the MC38-OVA-&#946;2M KO tumor model was treated with anti-PD-1, cyclic nucleotides (CDN), R-848 and anti-PD-1 combined with either CDN or R-848. At the endpoint, the composition of immune cells in spleens were analyzed by flow cytometry.<br \/>Results: Following confirmation of &#946;2M knockout, MHC-I expression and MHC-I-OVA peptide presentation were also diminished on MC38-OVA-&#946;2M KO cells, even after treatment of IFN- &#945;, IFN-&#946;, or IFN-&#947;. <i>In vivo<\/i>, anti-tumor efficacy of PD-1 blockade was significantly diminished in MC38-OVA-&#946;2M KO model (TGI=31%, <i>p<\/i>&#60;0.001), compared to MC38-OVA model (TGI=91%). To overcome the resistance, CDN, a STING agonist or R-848, a TLR7\/8 agonist was administered alone or combined with anti-PD-1 in the MC38-OVA-&#946;2M KO model. Single treatment of either CDN (TGI=73%) or R-848 (TGI=89%) markedly impeded tumor growth, and combination with anti-PD1 greatly enhanced their anti-tumor effects (TGI of 98% and 99%, respectively). Additionally, flow cytometry analysis showed a decrease of Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and an increase of NK cells in spleens of the mice treated with CDN and anti-PD-1. In parallel, a decrease of MDSCs was also observed in the mice with combined treatment of R-848 and anti-PD-1.<br \/>Conclusion: The successfully established MC38-OVA-&#946;2M KO model is a useful tool for investigating therapeutic strategies to overcome MHC-I down-regulation mediated immunotherapy resistance. Moreover, STING agonists and TLR7\/8 agonists may be potential candidates.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-1,I\/O Resistant,Combination therapy,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Li Hua<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Chenpan Nie<sup><\/sup>, Jie Lin<sup><\/sup>, Annie Xiaoyu An<sup><\/sup>, Ludovic Bourre<sup><\/sup>, Jingjing Wang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Crown Bioscience, Inc., San Diego, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"e8b55b47-080c-4af6-9636-e0f690f24e0c","ControlNumber":"3253","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

To that end, PDX Pharma, in collaboration with Oregon Health &#38; Science University, has developed a proprietary nanoparticle platform (Pdx-NP&#8482;) that can effectively co-deliver a plethora of therapeutic modalities while maintaining a small size in saline (100 nm), suitable for infusion and tumor accumulation. This enables the targeting of complementary cancer and immune pathways, leading to synergistic clinical benefits. Herein, we report on the second generation ARAC-02 (<u>A<\/u>ntigen <u>R<\/u>elease <u>A<\/u>gent and <u>C<\/u>heckpoint Inhibitor) which is designed to improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). While ICIs have improved survival in a subset of patients with advanced NSCLC, only a minority of patients respond to ICIs, highlighting the need for combination immunotherapy. ARAC-02 co-delivers a polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1)-targeted therapy (volasertib), a PD-L1 antibody, and the immune-stimulant CpG. These three agents were carefully selected based on their roles in cancer and immune pathways. Volasertib 1) selectively kills cancer cells, 2) modulates the immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment, and 3) upregulates PD-L1 expression in cancer cells, providing opportunity for targeted delivery with PD-L1 antibody on the nanoparticles. CpG is a TLR9 agonist that enhances antigen presentation to generate tumor-specific T cells. PD-L1 antibodies serve as tumor targeting agent for nanoparticle delivery as well as an ICI (i.e., PD-L1 degradation upon internalization with the nanoparticles), releasing the brakes and allowing T cells to attack the cancer. We found that the optimized ARAC-02 is preferentially internalized in PD-L1 expressing NSCLC cells, demonstrating a 10-fold greater uptake to PD-L1(high) NSCLC cells than PD-L1(low) normal cells. ARAC-02 effectively kills NSCLC cells regardless of their mutational status, while sparing normal cells. In a metastatic lung tumor model, ARAC-02 treatments reduced the tumor burden by 30-fold vs. saline control and 8-fold vs. the first generation ARAC (not containing CpG), whose effect was mainly mediated by CD8+ T cells. ARAC-02 was found to be safe to mice as assessed by body weight, serum biomarkers, and histology. Importantly, intravenous infusions of the platform was also found to be safe in a preliminary toxicology study in non-human primates. Due to its unique ability to catalyze various steps of the adaptive immune response, ARAC-02 is anticipated to provide superior outcomes in NSCLC and a broad range of tumor types regardless of baseline PD-L1 expression.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Nanoparticle,PD-L1,Cancer immunotherapy,Targeted drug delivery,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Moataz Reda<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Worapol Ngamcherdtrakul<sup>1<\/sup>, Ruijie Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Noah Crumrine<sup>1<\/sup>, Cole Baker<sup>1<\/sup>, Alyssa Wallstrum<sup>1<\/sup>, Jeremy Saito<sup>1<\/sup>, Natalie White<sup>1<\/sup>, Wassana Yantasee<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Pdx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Portland, OR,<sup>2<\/sup>Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"4ebf6f7b-e50c-4a66-97f6-fa0f5103e43b","ControlNumber":"5402","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

Restoration of NPRL2 expression in cancer cells induces DNA damages which leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We investigated the antitumor immune responses to NPRL2 gene therapy on anti-PD1 resistant KRAS\/STK11 mutant NSCLC in a humanized mouse model. H1299 cells transfected with NPRL2 showed significant inhibition of colony formation after NPRL2 transfection. Humanized mice were generated by transplanting fresh human cord blood derived CD34 stem cells into sub-lethally irradiated NSG mice. The level of engraftment of human CD45, CD3 T, CD19 B, NK cells was verified before tumor implantation. Mice harboring &#62; 25% human CD45 cells were considered humanized. KRAS\/STK11 mutant anti-PD1 resistant A549 NSCLC cells were injected intravenously into humanized NSG mice and developed lung metastasis. Metastases were treated with intravenous injection of NPRL2 gene loaded cationic lipid nanoparticles with or without pembrolizumab (anti-PD1). A dramatic antitumor effect was mediated by NPRL2 treatment, whereas pembrolizumab was ineffective. A significant antitumor effect was also found in non-humanized NSG mice, although the effect was greater in humanized mice suggesting that the possible role of antitumor immunity. The antitumor effect of NPRL2 was associated with increased infiltration of human CD45, CD3 T, cytotoxic T, NK cells, and a decreased number of human regulatory T cells (Treg) in tumors. PD1 expressing exhausted CD8 T cells were downregulated in both the NPRL2 and pembrolizumab groups. The number of activated T cells (CD69<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T), effector (EM) and central memory (CM) CD8 T cells were significantly increased by NPRL2 treatment. NPRL2 induced antigen presenting HLA-DR<sup>+<\/sup> dendritic cells. When NPRL2 was combined with pembrolizumab, no synergistic antitumor effect was found in the KRAS\/STK11 mutant anti-PD1 insensitive tumors. However, a robust and synergistic antitumor effect was observed in the KRAS wild type, anti-PD1 sensitive H1299 tumors grown in humanized mice treated with NPRL2 + pembrolizumab. Cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, and HLA-DR<sup>+<\/sup> DC were associated with the antitumor effect. DOTAP-NPRL2 was tested in a syngeneic mouse model with LLC2 tumors that are KRAS mutant and anti-PD1 resistant. Consistent with the A549 humanized mouse model, NPRL2 showed a significantly strong antitumor effect whereas anti-PD1 was not effective in this model. The antitumor effect of NPRL2 was again correlated with the upregulation of HLA-DR<sup>+<\/sup> DC, CD11c DC, TILs, NK and downregulation of Treg and myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment. Taken together, these data suggest that NPRL2 gene therapy induces antitumor activity on KRAS\/STK11 mutant anti-PD1 resistant tumors through DC mediated antigen presentation and cytotoxic immune cell activation.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-07 Immune response to therapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"NSCLC,Gene therapy,Immunotherapy,Resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ismail M.

Treatment of solid tumors has additional challenges - including immunosuppressive environments and low T cell infiltration - limiting the antitumor activity of CD3-bispecific TCEs. Conventional T cell activation and sustained proliferation requires signaling via CD3 (signal 1) and costimulatory molecules (signal 2), such as CD28. The balance between signals 1 and 2 is critical for optimal T cell activation &#8211; signal 1 in the absence of signal 2 results in T cell anergy, while overactivation via signals 1 and 2 can lead to T cell dysfunction and cytokine release, as observed with toxicities associated with &#945;CD28 superagonist antibodies (Abs). Optimal signal 2 costimulation via CD28 results in improved T cell fitness, activation and proliferation. To improve T cell responses in solid tumors, we developed costimulatory trispecific TCEs (TriTCE Co-stim) that engage CD3, CD28 and a tumor-associated antigen (TAA).<br \/>Our novel TriTCE Co-stim Abs were generated using the Azymetric<sup>TM<\/sup> and EFECT<sup>TM<\/sup> platforms to facilitate heterodimeric TriTCE Co-stim assembly and to knockout Fc gamma receptor interactions, respectively. To limit potential CD28-mediated toxicities, we evaluated a conventional &#945;CD28 agonist paratope and generated a paratope library with varying affinities for CD28. TriTCE Co-stim Abs were engineered with various formats, geometries, paratope affinities, and TAA specificities. To understand the impact of TriTCE Co-stim Abs on T cell activation, we assessed <i>in vitro <\/i>cytotoxicity, cytokine production and proliferation of primary human CD3 T cells in co-culture with TAA-expressing cancer cell lines. A human PBMC-engrafted xenograft model was used to assess<i> in vivo <\/i>antitumor<i> <\/i>activity in a TAA<sup>high<\/sup> tumor model.<br \/>TriTCE Co-stim Abs exhibited a range of cytotoxic potency, with several formats exhibiting greater potency than bispecific TCEs, and induced greater cytotoxicity of tumor cells in long term co-cultures at low effector to target ratios. TriTCE Co-stim Abs exhibited TAA-dependent cytokine release and T cell proliferation, with enhanced IL-2 production and proliferation compared to that induced by bispecific TCEs. Tumor growth regression was observed <i>in vivo<\/i> following treatment with different TriTCE Co-stim Ab formats. In summary, we identified TriTCE Co-stim Ab formats that exhibit improved proliferation and antitumor activity against multiple TAA targets compared to bispecific TCE, which may translate to improved and more durable antitumor responses in solid tumors with low T cell infiltration. The evaluation of multiple formats, geometries and paratope affinities allowed optimization of activity and selectivity to promote maximal therapeutic index and efficacy, key factors that may contribute to improved clinical outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-11 Therapeutic antibodies, including engineered antibodies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"T cell engager,Costimulation,Antibody engineering,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lisa Newhook<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Purva  P.

When DNA or RNA molecules are transported into cells, the approach is called gene electrotransfer (GET). ECT is an effective local treatment for tumors, but it lacks the systemic component of treatment that is essential for fighting metastatic disease. Cancer progression and metastasis are closely related to an inadequate antitumor immune response. Therefore, the antitumor efficacy of interleukin 12 (IL -12), a cytokine that stimulates the innate and adaptive immune response, has been tested in preclinical studies using plasmid DNA encoding IL -12 delivered into the tumor by gene electrotransfer (IL -12 GET). In addition, the combined treatment of ECT and IL -12 GET has already been shown to be effective in the treatment of mouse tumors and has been used in clinical trials in companion dogs to treat various histological types of spontaneous tumors. The results of these studies showed that the treatment is safe and effective. However, in these clinical trials, IL -12 GET was administered by different routes, either intratumorally (i.t.) or peritumorally (peri.t.). Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the two IL -12 GET routes of administration in combination with ECT and to determine their contribution to the enhanced response to ECT. In the clinical trial, 59 dogs with spontaneous mast cell tumors (MCT) were divided into two groups: one group was treated with the combination of ECT and GET peri.t. (29 dogs) and the other with the combination of ECT + GET i.t. (30 dogs). The efficacy of the treatment was compared with the group of 18 dogs treated with ECT alone. In addition, immunohistochemical studies of tumor samples before treatment and flow cytometric studies of PMBC before and after treatment were performed to determine immunological aspects of the treatment. The results of this study showed that local tumor control was significantly better in the ECT + GET i.t. group (p &#60; 0.05) than in the ECT + GET peri.t. and ECT groups. In addition, the disease-free interval (DFI) and progression-free survival (PFS) were significantly longer in the ECT + GET i.t. group than in the other two groups (p &#60; 0.05). The data on local tumor response, DFI and PFS were consistent with immunological studies, as we detected increased infiltration of antitumor immune cells after treatment in the ECT + GET i.t. group, also suggesting a systemic effect.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Interleukin-12,Platinum drugs,Drug delivery,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Maja Cemazar<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ursa Lampreht Tratar<sup>1<\/sup>, Nina Milevoj<sup>2<\/sup>, Katarina Znidar<sup>1<\/sup>, Katja Ursic Valentinuzzi<sup>1<\/sup>, Andreja Brozic<sup>1<\/sup>, Gregor Sersa<sup>1<\/sup>, Natasa Tozon<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Institute of Oncology Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia,<sup>2<\/sup>Veterinary faculty, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"67b5aa8d-b4de-48f5-a1ae-d33c64ce0aed","ControlNumber":"6873","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>M.

AKT inhibition has been shown to inhibit tumor growth as well as tumor angiogenesis. Archexin is a fully phosphorothioated 20-mer antisense oligonucleotide, which can specifically bind to AKT-1 mRNA resulting in RNase H-based AKT-1 downregulation. WGI-0301 is a proprietary lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation of Archexin designed for enhanced delivery. A phase I clinical study has recently been initiated for WGI-0301 in patients with advanced solid tumors.<br \/>Methods: Anti-tumor efficacy of WGI-0301 was studied <i>in vivo<\/i> in a Hepa1-6 syngeneic murine tumor model for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The mice were injected i.v. with vehicle control or WGI-0301 at 8 mg\/kg once weekly for 4 doses (n=8). Tumor size and body weight changes were monitored. In addition, the anti-angiogenesis activity of WGI-0301 was investigated <i>in vitro<\/i> using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). In the study, combination of WGI-0301 with Lenvatinib or Sorafenib were investigated to determine possible synergism. Three experimental groups were set up, including WGI-0301(0, 0.2, 2 and 20 &#956;M), WGI-0301+ 2 &#956;M Sorafenib, and WGI-0301+ 5 &#956;M Lenvatinib. The cells were plated at 1.5 &#215; 10<sup>4<\/sup> per well. The cells were treated with 50% Matrigel and then cultured in the 24 well plate in triplicates and were incubated for an additional 6 hours.<br \/>Results: The <i>in vivo<\/i> study demonstrated anti-tumor efficacy of WGI-0301 in the Hepa1-6 model. The tumor growth inhibition % (TGI) for WGI-0301 was 46.16%, and the medium survival time (MST) of the treatment group was 55 days, which was significantly different from that of the control group (37 days). There was no severe adverse event observed during the study. In the <i>in vitro<\/i> anti-angiogenesis study, WGI-0301 alone or in combination with 2 &#956;M Sorafenib and 5 &#956;M Lenvatinib exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of angiogenesis. Compared with the control group, 20 &#956;M WGI-0301 either alone or in combination with 2 &#956;M Sorafenib and 5 &#956;M Lenvatinib showed significantly inhibitory effect on angiogenesis. The 2 &#956;M WGI-0301 in combination with 5 &#956;M Lenvatinib also showed a significant inhibition effect on angiogenesis.<br \/>Conclusion: Data obtained demonstrated anti-tumor and anti-angiogenesis efficacy of WGI-0301. In addition, combining WGI-0301 with Sorafenib or Lenvatinib resulted in increased anti-angiogenetic activity relative to monotherapy. WGI-0301 warrants further investigation as a selective AKT-1 inhibitor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immunotherapy,Angiogenesis,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Fengyang Xie<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jia Wei<sup>2<\/sup>, Lan Deng<sup>2<\/sup>, Chao Wang<sup>2<\/sup>, Ben Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, Robert  J.

Combination therapy with LEN and everolimus is approved for people with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Combination therapy with LEN and pembrolizumab, an anti human-programmed-cell-death-1 (PD-1) antibody, is also approved for the treatment of people with advanced endometrial cancer and advanced RCC. In this study, we investigated the antitumor activity of LEN in combination with chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and explored the mechanism of action underlying these effects, in the mouse lung cancer syngeneic model.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> In the LL\/2 mouse Lewis lung carcinoma model, LEN was dosed at either 3 or 10 mg\/kg (orally; once daily for 2 weeks) with or without cisplatin 4 mg\/kg (intravenously; 3 or 4 times, twice weekly) and with or without anti-PD-1 200 ug\/head + anti cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) antibodies 10mg\/kg (intraperitoneally; twice weekly). Functional blood vessels were evaluated in tumor microenvironments by injections of Hoechst 33342 (Hoechst) into the tail veins of mice. The Hoechst-stained area and expressions of angiogenesis\/immune-cell-related molecules were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> In this model, the combination treatment of LEN 3 mg\/kg + cisplatin showed significant tumor growth inhibitory activity compared with each single agent without any marked body-weight loss. LEN 10 mg\/kg + cisplatin did not show enhanced antitumor activity vs LEN 10 mg\/kg as a single agent. IHC analysis using anti-CD31 antibody showed that LEN 3 mg\/kg daily decreased microvessel density in tumors after 4 days. In addition, LEN 3 mg\/kg daily for 4 days showed a trend toward an increase of the number of functional blood vessels stained with Hoechst in the tumor microenvironment compared with untreated controls. The combination of LEN 3 mg\/kg + cisplatin + ICIs (anti-PD-1+anti-CTLA4) significantly inhibited tumor growth compared with combinations of cisplatin + ICIs.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: Our findings show that LEN 3 mg\/kg enhances the antitumor activity of cisplatin in the LL\/2 mouse Lewis lung carcinoma tumor model; and LEN 3 mg\/kg + cisplatin + ICIs shows greater antitumor activity compared with cisplatin + ICIs. The results of the IHC analysis suggest that LEN 3 mg\/kg inhibits angiogenesis. Conversely, LEN 3 mg\/kg increases functional vessels in tumor microenvironments. This situation could enhance combination antitumor activity of chemotherapy, and also chemotherapy + ICIs combination treatment. Further analysis of the mechanism of action of LEN 3 mg\/kg in combination with chemotherapy + ICIs is warranted.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++IM01-02 Combination immunotherapies,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Angiogenesis inhibitor,Immunotherapy,Combination therapy,Lung cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yu Kato<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Yoichi Ozawa<sup>1<\/sup>, Keito Adachi<sup>1<\/sup>, Masahiko Kume<sup>1<\/sup>, Yusuke Adachi<sup>1<\/sup>, Yudai Narita<sup>1<\/sup>, Megumi Kuronishi<sup>1<\/sup>, Junji Matsui<sup>2<\/sup>, Akira Yokoi<sup>1<\/sup>, Yasuhiro Funahashi<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Eisai Co., Ltd., Tsukuba, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Eisai Inc., Nutley, NJ","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c4203afd-eb10-4037-8286-f5ac8930b35c","ControlNumber":"5886","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;Y.

The dominant immune regulatory activity of Treg cells is evidenced, both clinically and preclinically, by the profound inflammatory dysregulation that arises in their absence. Leveraging controlled depletion of Treg cells in tumor tissue while sparing Treg cells in healthy tissue may be achieved through antibody-mediated targeting of the C-C chemokine receptor 8 (CCR8). CCR8 is a seven transmembrane G-coupled chemokine receptor protein whose expression is predominantly upregulated on Treg cells in several types of tumors compared with peripheral blood. Importantly, depletion of CCR8-expressing Treg cells in tumors provides a novel pathway to immunotherapy that is mechanistically independent of checkpoint inhibition (CPI).<br \/>Using single-cell transcriptome and flow cytometry analyses, we evaluated the pharmacodynamic changes after treatment with anti-CCR8 antibodies to elucidate the effect of tumor Treg cell-targeting therapies on the downstream mechanisms of antitumor immunity within the TME.<br \/>SRF114, a highly selective human anti-CCR8 afucosylated antibody, and an anti-mouse CCR8 antibody were utilized to preferentially deplete CCR8<sup>+<\/sup> Treg cells in human CCR8 knock-in (hCCR8KI) or wild-type mice, respectively. Treatment with SRF114 or anti-mouse CCR8 antibody resulted in robust monotherapy activity in models susceptible to CPI. Moreover, pronounced monotherapy activity was also seen in checkpoint-resistant model(s), highlighting a mechanistically CPI-independent role for intratumoral Treg cell depletion to elicit potent antitumor activity. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with anti-CCR8 antibodies resulted in a significant reduction of tumor-associated Treg cells, while peripheral Treg cells remained unchanged. Analysis of bulk tumor lysates showed that anti-CCR8 therapy elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and pro-angiogenic and chemoattracting factors. Evaluation of effector T cells demonstrated that anti-CCR8 therapy drives proliferation of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and an increase in intracellular cytokine production of IFN&#947;, TNF&#945;, and granzyme A. Additionally, the tumor myeloid compartment was strongly affected by anti-CCR8 therapy. Multiple myeloid cell subsets had increased levels of co-stimulatory molecules and expression of PD-L1.<br \/>Altogether, selective depletion of intratumoral CCR8<sup>+<\/sup> Treg cells results in robust antitumor activity by reshaping the TME toward a more pro-inflammatory milieu, providing an orthogonal approach to CPI for eliciting antitumor immunity and a strong rationale for evaluating SRF114 as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of cancer.
