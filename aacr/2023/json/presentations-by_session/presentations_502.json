[{"Abstract":"Mutations in microRNA processing genes such as <i>DROSHA<\/i> and <i>DICER1<\/i> consist of 1.5-2% of pediatric cancers including a brain tumor called pineoblastoma. We developed a genetically engineered mouse model of Drosha- and Dicer1- driven pineal tumors. These tumors develop without microRNAs and express early pineal developmental markers. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed E2F target genes to be highly expressed in these tumors. One of the most upregulated genes in these tumors is cyclin D2 (Ccnd2). Additionally, these tumors stain positively for Rb phosphorylation. In a Wilms tumor cell line (WiT49) with Drosha knocked down, RNA sequencing revealed that <i>CCND2<\/i> was the most upregulated gene. Similarly, in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of DICER1-related tumors such as pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB), we observed high expression of CCND2 and positive staining for Rb phosphorylation. To test the dependence of Rb phosphorylation in Drosha and Dicer tumors, we next treated a Drosha pineal tumor allograft with a CDK4\/6 inhibitor, palbociclib, and observed tumor growth suppression. Additionally, treatment of <i>DICER1 <\/i>mutant PPB PDXs with palbociclib had similar results. These experiments suggest that CDK4\/6 is important for tumor proliferation in <i>Drosha<\/i> and <i>DICER1<\/i> driven cancers.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-01 Developmental origins and drivers of pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,DICER1,CCND2,Palbociclib,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Claudette  R.

DICER1 syndrome is a pleiotropic tumor predisposition syndrome in which clinical manifestations are normally first seen during childhood. This genetic disorder is defined by the presence of inherited or <i>de novo<\/i> <u>g<\/u>ermline <u>p<\/u>athogenic <u>v<\/u>ariants (GPVs) in the <i>DICER1<\/i> gene. While many germline loss of function variants fail to generate DICER1 protein, a subset of patients has germline missense variants that are predicted to produce full-length DICER1 protein that cluster in the DICER1 Platform domain, a region that plays a role in binding to the 5&#8217; phosphate of pre-miRNA stemloops. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the pathogenicity of missense variants in DICER1 syndrome, clinical actionability can be limited. To determine how Platform mutations predispose to DICER1 syndrome we characterized a number of these variants using <i>in vitro<\/i> pre-miRNA binding and cleavage assays. Interestingly, four of these variants displayed impaired pre-miRNA binding and processing, with three of them localizing to a hydrophobic pocket in the Platform domain. In keeping with <i>in vitro<\/i> results, DICER1 mutants displayed impaired miRNA processing when introduced into mesenchymal stem cells. Furthermore, we identified a second somatic hit in the RNase IIIb domain of DICER1 in thyroid nodular hyperplasia DNA from a patient affected by one of these variants. Taken together, these results identify a key region in the DICER1 protein that is essential for pre-miRNA processing and help the classification of these germline variants as pathogenic to ensure proper clinical management of affected patients. Additionally, these results provide insight on the molecular basis involved in DICER1 syndrome predisposition.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-01 Developmental origins and drivers of pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"MicroRNA,Genetic susceptibility,Pediatric cancers,Cancer genetics,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Dylan Pelletier<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Anne-Laure Chong<sup><\/sup>, Sophie Albert<sup><\/sup>, Marc Fabian<sup><\/sup>, William Foulkes<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Lady Davis Institute at Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f2cb61f3-0a3b-46b8-9a08-8837b2ff877d","ControlNumber":"988","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

Two tumors in particular, H3K27-altered diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) and group-A posterior fossa ependymomas (PFAs) arise from structures around the fourth ventricle, and strikingly, both tumors exhibit a global decrease in the histone mark histone 3, lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) that is associated with transcriptional repression. H3K27-altered DMGs primarily are found primarily in the pons and exhibit by lysine-to-methionine mutations at H3K27 (H3K27M). This missense mutation results in inhibition of the catalytic activity of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) which mediates H3K27me3 deposition. PFAs are found in the lateral recess of the fourth ventricle and the cerebellum and demonstrate overexpression of EZH inhibitory protein (EZHIP). EZHIP contains a domain with striking resemblance to the mutant H3K27M histone tail and similarly blocks PRC2 activity. Although H3K27me3 levels are dramatically reduced in both areas, select genes retain H3K27me3 in both tumor types. Increasingly, data have emerged demonstrating that cases of PFAs actually harbor H3K27M mutations and cases of H3-wildtype DMGs in fact overexpress EZHIP. The neighboring origins and overlapping recurrent H3K27me3-modulating alterations observed in these two pediatric brain tumors suggest certain populations of cells in the developing hindbrain may be particularly prone to malignant transformation in the setting of PRC2 inhibition. A systematic comparison of genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic datasets for both tumors identified key molecular similarities between subsets of DMGs and PFAs and highlighted how developmental signatures may be preserved in tumor expression profiles. Specifically, these analyses identify shared copy-number profiles between PFAs and different subtypes of DMGs and demonstrate that the Activin A Receptor Type 1 (ACVR1), a gene with recurrent activating mutations in H3K27-altered DMGs, is overexpressed in a subset PFAs with worse survival outcomes. Additionally, interrogation of the H3K27me3 and enhancer landscapes identified critical genes with similar chromatin profiles and revealed heterogeneity in repression of H3K27me3-marked genes that correlated with patterns of inferred anatomic origins for each tumor. Moreover, one of these genes, cellular retinoic acid binding partner 1 (<i>CRABP1<\/i>) showed enrichment in progenitor cell types in single-cell transcriptomic datasets. Together, these analyses characterize the common and unique molecular features of H3K27-altered DMGs and PFAs and shed light on the cellular contexts of the developing hindbrain that lead to development of each tumor.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-01 Developmental origins and drivers of pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cancer,Epigenomics,Brain tumors,Pediatric cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Matthew Pun<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Drew Pratt<sup>2<\/sup>, Patricia  R.

Preclinical drug testing to identify promising treatment options for relapsed patients or those with poor prognosis is hindered by the lack of well characterized and annotated preclinical models. In the framework of the ITCCP4 consortium (www.ITCCP4.eu) our group determined the pharmacological profile of 47 orthotopically implanted pediatric brain PDX models. The panel comprised 21 high grade glioma (HGG), 13 medulloblastoma (MB), eight ependymoma (EP), three non-classified brain tumors (XT), one atypical teratoid\/rhabdoid tumor (AT\/RT) and one neuroblastoma (NB).. Depending on the tumor type the models were screened in an eleven or twelve arms single mouse trial study layout. Three treatment arms comprised standard of care cytotoxic compounds and radiation, whereas the other arms covered targeted therapies, mostly small molecules. Tumor load was determined using a fluorescent based in vivo imaging technology based on the lentiviral transient transduction of the PDX cells with iRFP713 prior to implantation into the brain. In addition, body weight and neurological scoring was applied to determine the overall condition of the animals. At the end of the study brain tissue was harvested and tumor load confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The mean overall survival of the orthotopic implanted animals on study was 48 days with a minimum of 7 days and a maximum of 132 days. Overall, the treatment was well tolerated in the tumor bearing animals as determined by body weight measurement. However, the combination of two cytotoxic drugs in some of the arms needed dose adjustments due to increased toxicity. Across all tumor types at least one of the cytotoxic arms improved overall survival of the tumor bearing animals markedly: Temozolomide and Lomustine for HGG (43d and 50d, respectively vs 28d in the control arm), Lomustine and Endoxan for MB (99d and 73d, respectively vs 61d in the control arm), and Actinomycin D for EP (64d vs 52d). However, several of the targeted agents showed a distinct efficacy profile: Cobimetinib was efficacious in 50% of the HGG (47d vs 28d in the sensitive subset) and Idanasutlin in 80% of the EP models (79d in the sensitive subset vs 52d). The optical imaging signal over time confirmed tumor engraftment at the start of treatment. The most efficacious treatment arms induced growth delay or partial remission. This preclinical validation set gains even more importance using the accompanying molecular profiling data that are available not only for the PDX but also for the donor patient. Together with the breadth and depth of the still growing PDX collection, a unique preclinical platform for the development of drugs as well as companion diagnostics specifically for pediatric brain cancers is now available to the scientific community.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-03 Pediatric cancer models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX),Imaging,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Eva Oswald<sup>1<\/sup>, Dorothee Lenhard<sup>1<\/sup>, Kanstantsin Lashuk<sup>1<\/sup>, Stefan Pfister<sup>2<\/sup>, Louis Stancato<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Julia Schueler<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Freiburg, Germany,<sup>2<\/sup>DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany,<sup>3<\/sup>Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"c6f9dc05-062e-4e3d-8eba-9d5611d6f441","ControlNumber":"4488","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>E.

An example is the new fusion of transcriptional coactivators, VGLL2-NCOA2, found in infantile rhabdomyosarcoma<i>. <\/i>To delineate VGLL2-NCOA2 tumorigenic mechanisms and identify therapeutic vulnerabilities, we implemented a cross-species comparative oncology approach with zebrafish, mouse allograft, and patient samples. We found that in our transgenic zebrafish and mouse allograft models, VGLL2-NCOA2 is sufficient to generate mesenchymal tumors that display features of immature skeletal muscle. Zebrafish and mouse VGLL2-NCOA2 tumors are consistent with the human disease histologically and transcriptionally, and express diagnostic rhabdomyosarcoma markers. We found a shared molecular feature of these tumors was a suppression of myogenic differentiation pathways and reactivation of developmental programs. To identify impacted developmental programs, we transcriptionally clustered zebrafish VGLL2-NCOA2 tumors with the trajectory of early zebrafish development. A subset of VGLL2-NCOA2 zebrafish tumors cluster with embryonic somitogenesis and pinpoint VGLL2-NCOA2 developmental targets, including a RAS family GTPase, ARF6. In VGLL2-NCOA2 zebrafish, mouse allograft, and patient tumors, ARF6 is highly expressed and is absent from mature skeletal muscle. ARF6 knockout in our C2C12-VGLL2-NCOA2 cell culture model suppresses VGLL2-NCOA2 soft agar colony formation capacity, suggesting a genetic cooperating event in the disease. Our data indicate that VGLL2-NCOA2 is an oncogene which leverages developmental programs for tumorigenesis, and that the reactivation or persistence of ARF6 could represent a therapeutic opportunity.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-01 Developmental origins and drivers of pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Zebrafish,Rhabdomyosarcoma,Pediatric cancers,Fusion genes,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Sarah Watson<sup>1<\/sup>, Collette  A.

To date, treatment options for OS are still based on multi-drug chemotherapy and prognosis for metastatic patients is dismal, making urgent the identification of new therapies. OS is considered a differentiation disease, because of the incapability of mesenchymal stem cells or osteoblastic progenitors to proceed toward terminal differentiation. We tested the effects on OS cells of targeting ZEB1, a transcription factor known to be critical for the maintenance of mesenchymal and stemness features in cancer. We inhibited ZEB1 expression in a murine OS cell line by lentiviral vectors based on CRISPR-Cas9 technology. We firstly tested the effects of ZEB1 deficiency in vitro, evaluating OS cell stemness potential by sarcosphere forming assay and osteogenic differentiation by alkaline phosphatase (Alp) staining. Gene expression profile (GEP) comparing ZEB1 KO clones and control ones was also performed to investigate the transcriptional changes induced by ZEB1 deletion and potentially identify alternative, more easily druggable, therapeutic targets. We also investigated in vivo the effect of ZEB1 inhibition. ZEB1 KO clones showed decreased stemness potential and increased Alp staining, both features suggestive of a more differentiated phenotype. Preliminary GEP analysis showed 849 down-regulated genes and 1093 up-regulated genes in ZEB1 KO clones versus ZEB1-competent controls. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated a down-modulation of pathways related to cellular proliferation and survival such as MTORC1 signaling, MYC targets, GM2 checkpoint, E2F targets and oxidative phosphorylation in ZEB1 KO clones. In vivo we observed a reduced tumor growth in ZEB1 KO clones that were also characterized by a more differentiated morphology in comparison to controls. Interestingly, the absence of ZEB1 in tumor cells affected also the immune infiltrate, as tumors derived from ZEB1 KO clones were significantly less infiltrated by pro-tumoral CD206+ M2-like macrophages.

Osteosarcoma frequently metastasizes to the lungs, reducing patient survival with metastatic disease to 20% after 5 years. The goal of this study is to describe the function of WNT5B and its signaling pathway in osteosarcoma stem cells, metastasis and chemoresistance and its potential as a therapeutic target. Using RNA sequencing from publicly available datasets and immunohistochemistry on tumor microarrays, we reveal that WNT5B is the most expressed WNT in osteosarcoma patients and correlates with both metastasis and survival. Osteosarcoma is thought to result from a block in differentiation, and based on WNT5B&#8217;s role in inhibiting osteoblast differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells from normal bone, we hypothesized a role for WNT5B in osteosarcoma stem cells. In spheroids, we show that both protein and mRNA levels of WNT5B are enhanced in the stem cell population compared to adherent cells. We found that WNT5B upregulates the expression of the stemness gene <i>SOX2 <\/i>and directs stemness phenotypes, such as sphere forming efficiency, proliferation and migration. We show a reduction in sphere forming efficiency with 143B-WNT5B-knockdown cells compared to parental control cells which can be rescued with re-introduction of WNT5B. Additionally, we show that WNT5B drives proliferation and migration of osteosarcoma stem cells through increasing sphere size and capability to migrate on collagen matrix. Further, WNT5B enhances osteosarcoma chemoresistance to methotrexate. Through revealing a novel role for WNT5B in osteosarcoma cancer stem cells and therapy resistance, we present the WNT5B pathway as a candidate for therapeutically targeting osteosarcoma stem cells in patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-01 Developmental origins and drivers of pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Wnt signaling,Osteosarcoma,Cancer stem cells,Pediatric cancers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Rachel  S.

Recent studies have suggested that RNA methylation affects several fundamental cellular and molecular functions including mRNA splicing, stability, export, stem cell fate, circadian rhythms, DNA repair and cell survival. The objective of this study is to establish the mechanisms by which RNA demethylase ALKBH5 (AlkB homolog 5) facilitates tumor growth and progression.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> To establish the significance of RNA methylation in children&#8217;s cancers, we performed siRNA screen targeting m<sup>6<\/sup>A writers, erasers, and readers in osteosarcoma (OS). We used several OS cell lines including 143B, MG63, SaOS2, U2OS and multiple patient derived OS cell lines. Mechanistic studies were conducted using ALKBH5 KO and knockdown cells and by measuring the status of Autophagy and UPR associated proteins using Western blot analysis, confocal and electron microscopy.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> Our results revealed that depletion of ALKBH5, a demethylase that erases the m<sup>6<\/sup>A mark from the target gene, altered the autophagy in OS cells. Interestingly, we found that level of LC3, which is the universal marker for autophagy, was significantly increased in OS cells. RNA seq analysis showed that depletion of ALKBH5 significantly altered several autophagy related genes in the OS cells. To better understand the molecular mechanism by which ALKBH5 regulates autophagy, we investigated the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress-induced Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) pathway, which is a known activator of autophagy. We discovered that ER stress induced UPR signaling pathway is highly activated in ALKBH5 depleted cancer cells. Further, mechanistic studies suggested that ALKBH5 promoted ER homeostasis by controlling the expression of ER lipid raft associated 1 (ERLIN1), which binds to the activated inositol 1, 4, 5,-triphosphate receptor and facilitates its degradation via ERAD to maintain calcium flux between ER and mitochondria. Using functional studies and electron microscopy, we show that ALKBH5-ERLIN1-IP3R-dependent calcium signaling modulates the activity of AMP kinase, and consequently mitochondrial biogenesis. These findings thus reveal that ALKBH5 serves an important role in maintaining ER homeostasis and cellular fitness.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> These findings provide novel insight into how m<sup>6<\/sup>A may promote cancer cell growth by regulating the crosstalk among ER signaling, UPR, autophagy, and mitochondrial function. Our study is the first to show that RNA methylation plays an important role in osteosarcoma by regulating autophagy via UPR.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-02 Pediatric cancer genomics and epigenomics,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Osteosarcoma,RNA methylation,Autophagy,UPR,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Panneerdoss Subbarayalu<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Daisy Medina<sup>2<\/sup>, Pooja Yadav<sup>1<\/sup>, Santosh Timilsina<sup>1<\/sup>, Kunal Baxi<sup>2<\/sup>, Ratna Vadlamudi<sup>3<\/sup>, Yidong Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Manjeet Rao<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, UT Health San Antonio, San Antonio, TX,<sup>2<\/sup>Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute,  UT Health San Antonio, San Antonio, TX,<sup>3<\/sup>UT Health San Antonio, San Antonio, TX","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6a515225-13e7-477a-9e06-46e43b7bed96","ControlNumber":"7280","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>P.

No targeted therapies have been established and multimodal therapy is ineffective with a 5-year survival rate of 15-25%. Many questions about the biology of DSRCT remain unanswered including the critical genes regulated by the <i>EWSR1-WT1<\/i> fusion gene, the role of the - and +KTS fusion gene isoforms produced by alternative splicing, and the relationship between <i>EWSR1-WT1<\/i> binding and gene expression alterations. To address these questions, we established four doxycycline-inducible DSRCT cell lines that selectively knockdown the expression of <i>EWSR1-WT1<\/i>. RNA-seq analysis on these cell lines with or without <i>EWSR1-WT1<\/i> knockdown identified commonly altered genes and pathways. To illuminate the role of the <i>EWSR1-WT1<\/i> -KTS and +KTS isoforms, the -KTS, +KTS, or both isoforms were overexpressed in a mesothelial cell line, a hypothesized cell of origin for DSRCT. Remarkably, different gene expression alterations were observed between the -KTS and +KTS isoforms. While overexpression of the -KTS isoform upregulated 765 genes and downregulated 366 genes, overexpression of the +KTS isoform upregulated 203 genes and downregulated 25 genes. Gene set enrichment analysis showed <i>EWSR1-WT1<\/i> regulated gene signatures are recapitulated by overexpression of the -KTS isoform or both +\/-KTS isoforms, but not the +KTS isoform alone, suggesting the -KTS isoform predominantly regulates gene expression in DSRCT. To interrogate the influence of direct and indirect gene regulation by <i>EWSR1-WT1<\/i>, ChIP-seq and CUT&#38;RUN data were integrated into our RNA-seq analysis. Across each of our four DSRCT cell lines, approximately 25% of <i>EWSR1-WT1<\/i> bound peaks led to upregulation, 10% led to downregulation, and 65% led to no gene expression alteration. <i>EWSR1-WT1<\/i> binding accounted for 33% of <i>EWSR1-WT1<\/i> commonly upregulated genes but only 4.2% of commonly downregulated genes. Upregulated <i>EWSR1-WT1<\/i> bound genes were more likely to be bound in the promoter or first intron and coincide with Znf263 or Hoxb4 motifs. To evaluate the functional role of <i>EWSR1-WT1<\/i> targets in DSRCT biology, a screen of the 24 druggable <i>EWSR1-WT1<\/i> targets was conducted and a number of novel and known target genes were identified as important for DSRCT survival.

Our previous studies indicated that neuropeptide Y (NPY), which is secreted from ES tumors, stimulates tumor-induced bone degradation via its effect on macrophage recruitment and their subsequent osteoclastic differentiation. This effect was dependent on the autocrine activation of the NPY Y5 receptor (Y5R) expressed by ES cells. However, the exact mechanisms of the osteolytic activity induced by the NPY\/Y5R axis remained unknown. To identify the osteolytic factors released from ES cells due to the NPY\/Y5R autocrine loop activity, we used shRNA to silence NPY or Y5R in SK-ES-1 ES cells and compared concentrations of known factors involved in the regulation of bone homeostasis in their conditioned media by an antibody array. Four secreted factors were found to be significantly decreased after silencing of NPY signaling: interleukin 8 (IL-8; p&#60;0.005), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9; p&#60;0.05), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1; p&#60;0.005), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1; p&#60;0.05). Among these proteins, IL-8 and MMP-9 were selected as the main candidates for mediators of NPY-induced osteolysis. To test their role in ES-mediated stimulation of osteolysis, we co-cultured mouse RAW 264.7 cells, that represent monocyte\/macrophage lineage, with SK-ES-1 cells in the presence or absence of the MMP-9 inhibitor (JNJ-0966; 10-7M-10-5M) or anti-IL-8 neutralizing antibody (0.1-0.4&#181;g\/ml) and tested their effect on osteoclast differentiation detected by TRAP staining. Inhibiting MMP-9 activity significantly decreased osteoclastogenesis of RAW264.7 cells in dose-dependent manner, while blocking IL-8 had no significant effect on the number of formed osteoclasts. These findings implicate MMP-9 as the mediator of NPY osteolytic activity. Further studies are required to understand the exact mechanisms underlying these effects, as well as potential role of NPY-induced release of MCP-1 in macrophage recruitment to ES tumors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-04 Pediatric cancer tumor microenvironment and tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ewing sarcoma,Bone metastasis,Signaling,Osteoclast,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>James  J.

Although EWS::FLI1-low state cells are more metastatic in experimental models, the role of these cells in established EwS tumor ecosystems is unknown. Here we have leveraged multimodal single-cell sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and immunohistochemical profiling to characterize EwS cell subpopulations in cell lines, PDX models, and patient tumors. We identify CD73 as a marker of mesenchymal-high state EwS cells and show that CD73+ tumor cells share properties of experimentally-induced EWS::FLI1-low cells including altered cytoskeletons, enhanced migration and invasion, and increased expression of EWS::FLI1-repressed genes. However, CD73+ cells retain proliferative capacity and do not down-regulate the fusion or the EWS::FLI1-activated signature. Instead, CD73+ EwS cells selectively express a gene signature that is enriched in extracellular matrix (ECM) genes. Examination of xenograft and EwS patient biopsies confirms the existence of subpopulations of spatially and transcriptionally distinct ECM-producing tumor cells and shows them to be more prevalent in infiltrating regions. Importantly, the local tumor microenvironment (TME) surrounding these cells is rich in tumor-derived TNC, SPARC, and biglycan, ECM proteins that have been widely implicated in cancer metastatic progression. Significantly, CD73+ EwS cells also upregulate expression of ECM-sensing genes, including <i>ITGA5 <\/i>and <i>ITGB1<\/i>, suggesting potential to activate autocrine feedback loops. In support of this, interrupting outside-in ECM:integrin signaling cascades, through pharmacologic inhibition of FAK or SRC pathways, strongly reduces the invasive properties of CD73+ tumor spheroids in 3D collagen. Together these studies confirm the presence and functional importance of transcriptionally distinct tumor cell subpopulations in established EwS tumor ecosystems. In particular, our data reveal that highly mesenchymal tumor cells both generate and respond to pro-metastatic ECM proteins to support invasion. Studies are ongoing to determine the role of tumor cell-derived ECM on EwS progression and treatment resistance.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-04 Pediatric cancer tumor microenvironment and tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ewing sarcoma,Tumor heterogeneity,Extracellular matrix,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Emma  D.

Consequently, we used a conditional knockout (CRISPR\/Cas9) and rescue approach to target RRM1 in Ewing sarcoma cells and identified that loss of RRM1 results in upregulation of the expression of multiple members of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex, including c-Jun and c-Fos. This upregulation of AP-1 is mediated, in part, by SLFN11, which is expressed at high levels in Ewing sarcoma tumor and other pediatric sarcomas. Notably, the inducible expression of c-Jun and c-Fos in Ewing sarcoma cells impairs cell growth, downregulates the expression of the stem cell factor Sox2, and upregulates markers of cellular differentiation. In addition, small-molecule inhibitors of RNR, including gemcitabine and hydroxyurea, and HDAC inhibitors, which reduce the level of the RRM1 protein, also activate this AP-1 signaling pathway in Ewing sarcoma cells. Overall, these results provide novel insight into the critical pathways activated by loss of RNR activity and the mechanisms of action of inhibitors of RNR.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Ewing sarcoma,Ribonucleotide reductase,AP-1,DNA replication,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>David Gordon<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Emma Croushore<sup><\/sup>, Stacia Koppenhafer<sup><\/sup>, Kelli Goss<sup><\/sup>, Elizabeth Geary<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Pediatrics, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6f72f307-09ec-46e5-94a1-69f4ddf44751","ControlNumber":"617","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>D.

We are hampered by a paucity of predictive, immune-competent mouse models of this cancer with which to develop novel and effective immune-based therapies. To overcome this barrier, we analyzed the immune microenvironment of one of the few genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMM) of FP-RMS. Briefly, this model is driven by conditional knock-in expression of <i>Pax3:Foxo1<\/i> at the endogenous <i>Pax3<\/i> locus, with or without conditional loss of MST1\/2 (gene name <i>Stk4\/3<\/i>), a Hippo pathway mediator that is modulated by PAX3-FOXO1. These two genotypes demonstrate different disease penetrance and tumor location, with mice bearing loss of MST1\/2 exhibiting higher tumor penetrance and favoring head and neck disease sites. We hypothesize that these models exhibit differences in tumor-immune interactions in the microenvironment that correlate with these phenotypic differences. We aim to characterize the immune microenvironment differences between these tumors and to establish this GEMM as a predictive, syngeneic model of FP-RMS. Tumors were generated spontaneously from a GEMM of FP-RMS. Tumors expressed PAX3-FOXO1 and either carried a conditional loss of MST1\/2 (MST<sup>null<\/sup>) or native MST1\/2 (MST<sup>wt<\/sup>). We analyzed 8 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumors and 2 tumor-derived cell lines from these novel models. FFPE tumor samples were analyzed via immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CD3 (T cell marker) and CD11b (myeloid cell marker) and were scored for immune cell infiltration. Overall, tumors demonstrate poor CD3<sup>+<\/sup> T cell infiltration with significantly higher infiltration of CD11b<sup>+<\/sup> myeloid cells (p=0.0002); this trend is also seen within the individual MST<sup>wt<\/sup> (p=0.0286) and MST<sup>null<\/sup> cohorts (p=0.0286). There was no significant difference in CD3<sup>+<\/sup> T cell or CD11b<sup>+<\/sup> myeloid cell density between the two genotypes. The drivers of this immune phenotype and the role of Hippo pathway signaling in mediating RMS tumor immune cell infiltration warrants further investigation.

Previous RNA expression studies have shown that these FP RMS tumors also express high levels of MYCN and lower levels of MYC. Our recent studies of FP RMS tumors revealed an inverse relationship between MYCN and MYC RNA expression in FP RMS tumors. Western blot studies of FP RMS cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors identified tumors with high level MYCN and MYC protein expression as well as tumors with high level protein expression of either MYC or MYCN. To model the interaction of P3F with Myc family proteins in FP RMS, we generated human Dbt myoblasts with doxycycline-inducible P3F (iP3F) with or without constitutively expressed MYCN. We previously observed that doxycycline-treated human Dbt myoblasts engineered with iP3F and constitutive MYCN expression (Dbt-MYCN-iP3F) form foci <i>in vitro<\/i> and rapidly form tumors <i>in vivo<\/i>, while doxycycline-treated Dbt myoblasts engineered with only iP3F expression (Dbt-iP3F) do not form foci <i>in vitro<\/i> and form tumors <i>in vivo<\/i> at a slower rate. Western blot and qRT-PCR analysis of the parental and tumor-derived (TD) Dbt-MYCN-iP3F lines revealed high MYCN and low MYC expression. In contrast, Dbt-iP3F parental lines express moderate levels of MYC and very low levels of MYCN whereas iP3F TD lines show increased MYC and MYCN expression, though this level of MYCN expression is considerably less than that seen in Dbt-MYCN-iP3F lines. Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology to knockdown MYCN or MYC, we found a primary dependence on MYCN in both Dbt-MYCN-iP3F parental and TD lines as indicated by loss of focus formation following MYCN knockdown while MYC knockdown does not interfere with oncogenicity. In contrast, oncogenicity in Dbt-iP3F TD lines is primarily dependent upon MYC whereas MYCN knockdown results in a modest and variable effect on oncogenicity. To elucidate the role of Myc proteins on the expression of P3F target genes, we measured expression of several transcriptional targets in these parental and TD lines by RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR. Several target genes (such as FGFR4) showed comparable upregulation by P3F in both parental and TD lines with or without constitutive MYCN expression. In contrast, a few target genes (such as FGF8) were stimulated by P3F at low levels in Dbt-iP3F parental lines and were stimulated at much higher levels in Dbt-iP3F TD lines as well as in both Dbt-MYCN-iP3F parental and TD lines. This finding indicates that some P3F target genes do not require high MYCN or MYC expression whereas other P3F target genes can only be maximally stimulated by P3F in the presence of high levels of MYCN and\/or MYC. We postulate that the dependence of FP RMS on high level expression of a Myc family protein may be explained by the need to stimulate expression of one or more of the P3F target genes in this latter category.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-01 Developmental origins and drivers of pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Rhabdomyosarcoma,MYCN,Fusion proteins,Tumorigenicity,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Bishwanath Chatterjee<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Salah Boudjadi<sup><\/sup>, Puspa Raj Pandey<sup><\/sup>, Hana Kim<sup><\/sup>, Wenyue Sun<sup><\/sup>, Frederic  G.

Despite significant efforts to characterize the transcriptomic and genetic abnormalities of the disease, the prognosis for patients with advanced or refractory disease has remained unchanged for more than four decades. Preclinically, studies have been hampered by insufficient animal models. For example, the hindlimb orthotopic model, an injection into the gastrocnemius muscle of immunocompromised mice, produces highly encapsulated, non-invasive, non-metastatic tumors. While this model has shown a reasonable recapitulation of tumor proliferation response, investigators using this model are unable to assess the effect of their investigational treatment on local invasion or distant metastasis. Moreover, transgenic mouse models of RMS, while commonly metastatic, diverge significantly from the transcriptomic signature of human tumors. With these considerations, we hypothesized that an alternative orthotopic site, the tongue, may provide a more representative xenograft model of RMS. In a proof of principal experiment, the fusion negative RMS (FN-RMS) cell line RD was injected into the skeletal muscle of the tongue, a lingual intramuscular (LIM) injection. Tongue tumors establish in approximately 60-80% of mice injected within approximately 40 days. By histopathology, the primary tumors show evidence of local invasion. Interestingly, approximately 60% of these tumors also spread to local cervical lymph nodes, a process not observed in hindlimb orthotopic models or subcutaneous models. We expanded our investigation to include additional FN-RMS cell lines: RMS-YM, SMS-CTR, and a MEK inhibitor resistant cell line CTR-557. Mice injected with RMS-YM cells established tumors in at least 60% of mice by 75 days post injection. Additionally, enlarged local and distant lymph nodes are observed in 50% of these mice. Intriguingly, mice injected with SMS-CTR or its MEK inhibitor resistant derivative, CTR-557, frequently have tumors in both local and distant lymph nodes without evidence of a primary tongue tumor. One mouse in each group also had pulmonary metastases. Taken together, this model not only demonstrates the first orthotopic xenograft model of spontaneous metastasis for FN-RMS, it also mimics the spread of disease that is observed clinically in RMS originating in the head and neck. Ongoing and future studies include 1) generating highly metastatic human FN-RMS cell lines; 2) using spatial transcriptomics to compare the tumor microenvironment of non-metastatic hindlimb tumors and invasive and\/or metastatic lingual tumors; and 3) identifying drivers of FN-RMS dissemination through transcriptomic, genome accessibility, and phospho-proteomic methods.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-03 Pediatric cancer models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Rhabdomyosarcoma,Mouse models,Metastasis,Xenografts,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Katie E.

PAX3-FOXO1 (P3F) is the dominant oncogenic driver of fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma (FP-RMS) with no targeted therapy. We developed methods to directly measure endogenous P3F protein levels amenable to high-throughput drug screens to identify suppressors of P3F.<br \/>Methods: HiBiT tag, an 11 amino acid peptide of the small fragment of NanoLuc luciferase, was inserted into the endogenous P3F using CRISPR-Cas9 in FP-RMS cell lines RH4 and SCMC. Western analysis was used for HiBiT tag validation and confirmation of P3F suppression. RNA-seq and ChIP-seq were used to assess transcriptomics and DNA binding of HiBiT-tagged P3F (P3F-HiBiT) respectively. High-throughput drug screen using Nano-Glo luciferase assay was performed using the Mechanism Interrogation PlatE (MIPE 5.0) drug library, which included 2,480 drugs with known mechanisms of action. CellTiter-Glo was used to monitor cell viability. We identified drugs that suppressed P3F by Nano-Glo without acute cytotoxicity by CellTiter-Glo at an early 24-hour timepoint. Mouse xenograft model of FP-RMS was used to investigate in vivo efficacy of top hits.<br \/>Results: We validated HiBiT tagging of P3F and not the wild-type FOXO1 by Western analysis. We showed that the HiBiT tag did not change the function of P3F by transducing human fibroblasts with P3F-HiBiT versus unmodified P3F. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of RNA-seq showed that P3F-HiBiT activated the same downstream target genes as unmodified P3F. ChIP-seq using HiBiT antibody in HiBiT-tagged FP-RMS cell lines RH4 and SCMC matched the genomic locations from ChIP-seq with P3F antibody in parental RH4 and SCMC. Using a cutoff of Area Under the Curve (AUC) of CellTiter-Glo - AUC of Nano-Glo &#62; 90, in both RH4 and SCMC, identified 182 compounds. Filtering for drugs with &#8805; 3 hits for the same target identified 14 drug classes that suppressed P3F protein level including HDAC inhibitors (3), mTOR inhibitors (4), CDK inhibitors (8), and BRD4 inhibitors (3). One top hit was the CDK inhibitor TG02 (Zotiraciclib), currently in human trials. TG02 suppressed P3F protein levels by Nano-Glo and Western analysis. We confirmed induction of apoptosis by PARP cleavage in a panel of FP-RMS cell lines. GSEA analysis of RNA-seq after treatment with TG02 showed marked suppression of P3F target gene sets. TG02 also significantly delayed tumor progression of established tumors in a mouse xenograft model of FP-RMS without weight loss.<br \/>Conclusion and Future Directions:By HiBiT tagging the fusion oncogene P3F, we identified 182 compounds that suppress P3F levels of which TG02 was a top hit that also showed in vivo efficacy. Drug combination studies are currently underway to identify synergistic suppressors of P3F protein levels that can be translated into clinical trials.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Rhabdomyosarcoma,Fusion genes,Drug-discovery screen,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yong Yean Kim<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Robert  G.

Incidence of HB has been increasing in the past 10 years. Risk stratification of HB patients is established by the extent of the liver disease, patient age, levels of serum AFP and presence of metastatic disease. Currently, treatment and prognosis of HB patients relies on chemotherapy and complete tumor resection. Unfortunately, patients with high-risk HB (metastatic, unresectable, refractory and recurrent) have dismal prognosis. The molecular mechanisms underlying the aggressiveness and metastatic potential of the tumor have not been elucidated yet. Tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 and 2 (IDO 1 and IDO-2) are enzymes in mammals that catabolize tryptophan to kynurenine and its activity has been related with immunoregulation and tumorigenesis. While TDO and IDO-1 have been extensively studied before the discovery of IDO-2, the role of the later in tumorigenesis is still under evaluation. Expression of IDO-2 is normally found in liver, kidney, pancreas, brain and epididymis while a dysregulated expression was reported in different types of cancer. IDO-2 activity was found to affect both the immune cells activation status and also the proliferation, migration and survival of tumor cells both <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Despite being expressed in normal liver tissues, IDO-2 expression has never been assessed in HB cells. The aim of this study was to determine if IDO-2 mRNA is expressed in HB cell lines and to determine if this expression is correlated with patient risk classification. By using real-time RT-PCR, we determined the expression of IDO-2 in commercially available HepG2 cells and in three patient derived xenograft (PDX)-derived HB cell lines (HB214, HB279, HB 303) (high risk metastatic, high-risk non metastatic and-low risk, respectively). IDO-2 is expressed in both HepG2 cells and in the 3 PDX-derived cell lines. Data analysis by using linear mixed effects modelling followed by t-tests to examine specific comparisons showed significant differences between cell lines. Expression of IDO-2 in cells from the metastatic tumor (HB214) was significantly higher than in HepG2 and cells from non-metastatic disease (p&#60;0.05). In conclusion, we report here for the first time that IDO-2 is expressed in HB cells. Although further investigation should be conducted in order to understand its specific role in HB, the findings in this work suggest that IDO-2 expression might be related with clinical tumor behavior.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,IDO,Metastatic potential,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lisandro Luques<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Ashby Kissoondoyal<sup>1<\/sup>, Emily De Sousa<sup>1<\/sup>, Paula Quaglietta<sup>1<\/sup>, David Malkin<sup>1<\/sup>, Stefano Cairo<sup>2<\/sup>, Emilie Indersie<sup>3<\/sup>, Reto Baertschiger<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Genetics & Genome Biology Program, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada,<sup>2<\/sup>Champions Oncology Inc, Rockville, MD,<sup>3<\/sup>XenTech, Evry, France","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0b08818a-3361-4ef4-b5b1-f04432f95c60","ControlNumber":"6217","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>L.

While most tumors respond well to treatment with good outcomes, there are a subgroup of refractory tumors for which novel therapies are required. Emerging literature has suggested a role of Hsp90 in HB progression. One possible mechanism hypothesizes that Hsp90 helps stabilize misfolded proteins that contribute to HB progression including &#946;-catenin. Our study aimed to investigate if inhibition of Hsp90 would affect the cell viability of hepatoblastoma cell lines in vitro.<br \/>Methods: Commercially available HEPG2, and patient xenograft-derived hepatoblastoma cell lines (HB214, HB279, and HB303) were analyzed for differences in Hsp90 gene expression by qRTPCR as well as cell viability (n = 3 replicates for each cell line) using the MTS assay. Differences in cell viability for each cell line were further examined after treatment with a 0.1&#181;M or 0.25&#181;M dose of 17-AAG (an HSP90 inhibitor) for 48H. We examined gene expression and the MTS assay cell viability data using linear mixed effects modelling followed by t-tests to examine specific comparisons (significance at p &#60; 0.05).<br \/>Results: Hsp90 gene expression was significantly increased in HEPG2 cells (p &#60; 0.001) and in HB279 cells (p &#60; 0 .05), but not in HB214, or HB303 cells, compared to HUVECs control cells. Examining clinically relevant characteristics, significant improvements to model fit were found with the inclusion of sex (p &#60; 0.01), &#946;-catenin deletion status (p &#60; 0.01), and a higher PRETEXT stage but not from examining if cell lines were derived from metastatic parent tumors. While we observed no significant cell line viability differences between individual HB cell lines at baseline (0&#181;M 17-AAG treatment) or overall significant differences for treatment with either 0.1&#181;M or 0.25&#181;M dosages of 17-AAG, there were differences in cell viability for individual HB cell lines. We observed significant decreases in cell viability in HEPG2 cells with 0.1&#181;M (p &#60; 0.05) and 0.25&#181;M (p &#60; 0.05), as well as in HB279 cells with 0.1&#181;M (p &#60; 0.05) and 0.25&#181;M (p &#60; 0.05) 17-AAG treatments but observed no effect of 17-AAG treatment on cell viability in HB214, or HB303 cells. Similar improvements in model fit were observed with the inclusion of sex (p &#60; 0.01), &#946;-catenin deletion status (p &#60; 0.01), and a higher PRETEXT stage (p &#60; 0.001), but not from examining if cell lines were derived from metastatic parent tumors.<br \/>Conclusion: HB cell lines express Hsp90 at levels correlated with age, &#946;-catenin deletion status, and risk stage. Moreover, the expression levels of Hsp90 corresponded to the sensitivity of each cell line to the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG, with cells more highly expressing Hsp90 having a greater reduction in cell viability. Continuing to understand the mechanisms of Hsp90 action in HB, particularly through the previously demonstrated connection with &#946;-catenin, may identify potential targetable therapies in the care of HB.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-03 Pediatric cancer models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liver cancer,Signaling,Drug sensitivity,Heat shock proteins,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ashby Kissoondoyal<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Emily DeSousa<sup>1<\/sup>, Paula  R.

Drug toxicity and relapse of the disease necessitate new therapeutic strategies. The implementation of drug candidates in the clinic is usually followed by <i>in vitro<\/i> validation, which requires accurate and clinically relevant<i> in vitro<\/i> models. We report here a robust 3D tumoroid-based platform, for testing various clinical protocols, e.g. therapeutic agents following a single or repeated exposure, alone or in combination with focal therapy (thermotherapy). The platform, generated from the Y79 retinoblastoma cell line, consists of matrix-embedded tumoroids, which retain the key features of the disease and allow prolonged culture time. Following the optimization of growth conditions, the effect of single and repeated exposure to chemotherapeutic agents has been measured by high-throughput automated fluorescence imaging followed by quantification. The clinical conditions of chemothermotherapy have been recapitulated with a setup consisting of: an infrared diode laser (810 nm, 0.3 W) that heats the tumoroids in the presence of indocyanine green (50 &#181;g\/mL); a thermal camera to enable real-time temperature measurement; and an environment-controlled inverted microscope to ensure physiological conditions and precise focusing of the laser. Melphalan and carboplatin, two drugs currently used to treat retinoblastoma in clinical protocols of chemotherapy and chemothermotherapy respectively, have been applied to validate the system.Tumoroid viability and size progressively decreased over 4 weeks of repeated drug exposure with melphalan, reflecting the response of retinoblastoma in advanced clinical cases. Carboplatin treatment showed an activity enhancement in the tumoroid model similar to that observed in the clinic, when combined with focal therapy, demonstrating that the platform system closely recapitulates the clinical conditions. Inversely, the thermotherapy experimental protocol designed for 2D <i>in vitro<\/i> cell culture and commonly used to date, i.e. an incubation temperature increased to 42 &#186;C for 1 h, did not show an improvement of the carboplatin cytotoxicity, confirming that our laser-based thermotherapy protocol provides a more accurate and clinically relevant drug response.<br \/>Such an approach, combining physiologically relevant <i>in vitro<\/i> cancer models and investigation of drugs in well-established treatment modalities, can significantly reduce the number of new drug candidates that give false-positives or overestimated efficacies when evaluated in relevant <i>in vivo<\/i> models. It is expected that the platform will contribute to the implementation of new therapeutic strategies to treat retinoblastoma, and could also be adapted to other diseases for which repeated drug exposure and\/or chemothermotherapy is relevant.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-03 Pediatric cancer models,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Pediatric cancers,Carboplatin,Hyperthermia,In vitro,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Irina Sinenko<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Fabien Kuttler<sup>2<\/sup>, Valentin Simeonov<sup>3<\/sup>, Alexandre Moulin<sup>4<\/sup>, Christina Stathopoulos<sup>4<\/sup>, Gerardo Turcatti<sup>2<\/sup>, Adeline Berger<sup>4<\/sup>, Francis Munier<sup>5<\/sup>, Paul Dyson<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Institute of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland,<sup>2<\/sup>Biomolecular Screening Facility, School of Life Sciences, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland,<sup>3<\/sup>Laboratory of Environmental Remote Sensing, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland,<sup>4<\/sup>Jules-Gonin Eye Hospital, Foundation Asile des Aveugles, Lausanne, Switzerland,<sup>5<\/sup>Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d34f542b-1e63-47f1-becf-b85d5d8fa27e","ControlNumber":"643","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>I.

The combination of these mutations is thought to transform developmentally pliant embryonic cells to initiate tumorigenesis. However, the mechanistic interactions between CNVs, oncogenes, and differentiation have not been systematically studied due to several obstacles: (i) CNVs cannot be engineered efficiently yet; (ii) transient embryonic progenitors are absent in full-grown tumors; and (iii) inter-species differences in lineage specification limit the applicability of animal models.<br \/>To overcome these challenges, we used isogenic human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines carrying gains of chromosome 17q\/1q, which are prevalent in the embryonal tumor neuroblastoma (NB). We differentiated these cells toward trunk neural crest (NC) and their sympathoadrenal derivatives, the putative cells-of-origin of NB, and performed single-cell RNA sequencing and cell-biological assays at key differentiation stages. We found that CNVs impaired the specification of sympathoadrenal cell types and instead potentiated early Schwann-cell-precursor-like phenotypes. Additional overexpression of the oncogene MYCN (which is frequently amplified together with CNVs in high-risk NB tumors) exacerbated these differentiation defects, enabled tumourigenic cell proliferation, and generated cell states in vitro that transcriptionally resembled NB tumor cells. Finally, using epigenome analysis, we connected these states to a stepwise disruption of gene-regulatory networks centered on developmental transcription factors.<br \/>Together, our results chart a mechanistic route to NB tumorigenesis and provide a general framework for the CNV-driven initiation of embryonal tumors, in which CNVs &#8216;prime&#8217; embryonic cells for oncogenic transformation. The tumor-like cells in our model may serve as proxies to experimentally test therapeutic interventions during tumorigenesis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-01 Developmental origins and drivers of pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroblastoma,Copy number variation,Differentiation,Single cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Ingrid M.

These cell types can spontaneously interconvert, but the mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we hypothesize that the tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) within the tumor microenvironment contribute to pro-tumorigenic factors production and drive switching from ADRN to MES state in neuroblastoma. We first demonstrate the ADRN and MES lineage identity of NB cell lines by Western blot and compared the control and NB cell lines co-cultured with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), the precursor cell of CAF, and monocyte in transwell. Initial experiments demonstrated the morphology of NB cell line CHLA255 and CHLA136 showing increased spreading area and spindle shape in TAM-CAF co-cultures compared to control cells. As compared to control cells, monocytes and MSC-CAF co-culture induced the MES lineage markers SOX9 and Notch1 of NB cell lines that had low basal SOX9 expression, with a reduction in protein levels of ADRN lineage markers PHOX2B, and GATA3. Next, single-cell RNA-sequencing was utilized to analyze the expression of TAM and CAF, and MES- and ADRN-signature genes of NB cells in NB-TAM-CAF co-cultures. Single-cell analyses of TAM-CAF co-cultured CHLA255 and CHLA136 demonstrated enrichment of MES signature over time providing clear evidence of mesenchymal differentiation of NB cells within a TME-rich environment. Pathway enrichment analyses reveal enrichment of pathways associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and epithelial to mesenchymal of TAM-CAF co-cultured NB cell lines. Our results suggested that the presence of CAF and TAM in the tumor microenvironment drives neuroblastoma ADRN: MES switch akin to that observed in epithelial: mesenchymal switch in adult tumors. ADRN-MES state switching has been shown relevant for tumor relapse and therapy resistance. Our studies point to a therapeutic vulnerability by targeting cells and pathways activated in the NB-TAM-CAF axis.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-04 Pediatric cancer tumor microenvironment and tumor heterogeneity,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroblastoma,Tumor associated macrophages,Adrenergic to mesenchymal transition,Tumor microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Meng-Hua Lee<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kevin Louault<sup><\/sup>, Krinio Giannikou<sup><\/sup>, Xiangming Ding<sup><\/sup>, Alice Yanovsky<sup><\/sup>, Jin-Seok Park<sup><\/sup>, Yves  A.

Approximately 10% of pediatric neuroblastoma patients harbor mutations in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). In a previous study, we identified SLC3A2 as a potential interacting partner with ALK using BioID-based <i>in vivo<\/i> proximity labeling. SLC3A2 is a multifunctional protein that mediates integrin-dependent signaling, acts as a trafficking chaperone for amino acid transporters, and regulates polyamine transport. No previous link to ALK signaling has been reported and the underlying mechanisms and functional consequences of a SLC3A2-ALK interaction in ALK-driven neuroblastoma are unclear.<br \/>Materials &#38; Methods: The interaction of SLC3A2 and ALK initially detected with BioID-based <i>in vivo<\/i> proximity labeling was validated by immunoprecipitation. The effect of ALK signaling on SLC3A2 expression and protein stability was evaluated by quantitative PCR and immunoblotting. The functional effect of SLC3A2 on cell viability were investigated by siRNA and inhibitor treatments in both human and mouse ALK-driven neuroblastoma cells.<br \/>Results: SLC3A2 was confirmed to interact with ALK in both anti-ALK and anti-SLC3A2 antibody co-immunoprecipitations from NB1 cells (ALK-wild-type) and CLB-GE (ALK-F1174V). Moreover, this interaction was decreased by ALK inhibitor (lorlatinib) treatment. Upon ALKAL2 ligand treatment, ALK signaling increased the protein levels of SLC3A2 and this was abrogated by lorlatinib treatment in NB1 cells. Furthermore, lorlatinib treatment suppressed SLC3A2 expression and significantly affected protein stability in neuroblastoma cells with different ALK mutations including CLB-BAR (ALK exon4-11 deletion), CLB-GAR (ALK-R1275Q), and CLB-GE (ALK-F1174V) during cycloheximide chase analysis. Knockdown of SLC3A2 significantly inhibited cell growth and down-regulated the amino acid transporter SLC7A5 (LAT1) expression in CLB-GE cells (ALK-F1174V). While mono treatment of either lorlatinib (ALK TKI) or AMXT-1501 (polyamine transport inhibitor) only showed moderate effects, combinatorial treatment exhibited a synergistic effect on cell growth in ALK-driven primary-cultured mouse neuroblastoma #9883 (Th-<i>MYCN<\/i>; <i>Alk-F1178S<\/i>) and #111 (Th-<i>MYCN<\/i>; <i>Rosa26_Alkal2<\/i>) cells.<br \/>Conclusions: SLC3A2 protein stability and its interaction with ALK is dependent on ALK signaling in an ALK-driven neuroblastoma context. The synergistic effect of combined ALK and polyamine transport inhibitors suggests a potential therapeutic option for ALK-driven neuroblastoma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-01 Developmental origins and drivers of pediatric cancer,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ALK,Neuroblastoma,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Wei-Yun Lai<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Tzu-Po Chuang<sup><\/sup>, Marcus Borenäs<sup><\/sup>, Ruth Palmer<sup><\/sup>, Bengt Hallberg<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"54e45ee8-0e1a-4878-8cdc-fa21ee701a73","ControlNumber":"4342","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>W.

Relapsed NBs harbor increased RAS\/MAPK pathway mutations and increased expression and downstream activity of the transcriptional co-regulator YAP. We have previously shown that YAP mediates resistance to chemotherapy and MEK inhibitors in RAS mutant NBs (Shim<i> et al., Cancer Res <\/i>2020). Patients with relapsed NB are treated with the GD2-targeting monoclonal antibody dinutuximab in combination with chemotherapy. Given the increased expression and activity of YAP in relapsed HR NB, we posited that YAP might also play a role in GD2 immunotherapy response.<br \/><u>Methods\/Results<\/u> We stably knocked down YAP in the human derived NRAS mutant SK-N-AS NB cell line with a scrambled short hairpin (sh) control or 2 YAP-targeting shRNAs to generate 3 distinct cell lines. Dinutuximab requires antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and we have shown that gamma delta (&#947;&#948;) T cells augment dinutuximab in aggressive NB models. We exposed the shYAP1, shYAP2, and control SK-N-AS cells to &#947;&#948; T cells with\/ without dinutuximab. YAP knockdown sensitized both SK-N-AS shYAP cell lines to &#947;&#948; T cell killing both in the presence and absence of dinutuximab. To investigate the mechanism of increased dinutuximab sensitivity, we evaluated a panel of NB cell lines (<i>MYCN<\/i> amplified and <i>MYCN<\/i> single copy) for YAP protein and GD2 cell surface expression and noted an inverse relationship. That same inverse correlation was found for GD2 and YAP gene expression in primary HR NB tumor datasets. We therefore evaluated GD2 expression following YAP knockdown in SK-N-AS and show that GD2 significantly increased<i> <\/i>on the cell surface following YAP inhibition. PRRX1 is a master transcription factor that induces a mesenchymal NB phenotype which is one of high YAP expression with very low to no GD2 surface expression. Interestingly, <i>PRRX1<\/i> expression increased in YAP knockdown cells yet GD2 expression also increased, suggesting YAP regulates GD2 expression more directly than PRRX1. In the GD2 biosynthesis pathway, GM3 is converted into GD3 by GD3 synthase (GD3S). GD2 synthase then catalyzes GD3 into GD2. GD3S gene<i> <\/i>(<i>ST8SIA1<\/i>) expression significantly increased (&#62;100-fold) upon YAP knockdown. Furthermore, shRNA stable inhibition of GD3S in shYAP NB cells reverted the phenotype and decreased GD2 cell surface expression back to baseline. We then treated established SK-N-AS control or shYAP xenografts with an 18-day course of human &#947;&#948; T cells, dinutuximab, and cyclophosphamide. Pilot results show significantly extended survival in mice harboring SK-N-AS shYAP tumors.<br \/><u>Conclusion<\/u> These results support YAP regulation of GD2 expression through transcriptional suppression of GD3 synthase and identify YAP as a therapeutic target to augment GD2 immunotherapy responses in HR and relapsed NB.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++TB06-05 Other,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Neuroblastoma,Gamma-delta lymphocytes,Ganglioside,Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Adeiye  A.
