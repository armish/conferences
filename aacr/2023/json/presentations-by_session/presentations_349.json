[{"Abstract":"<b>Background: <\/b>Despite immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) has extended survival in patients (pts) with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), acquired resistance to ICI develops after an initial clinical benefit. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of acquired resistance to ICI in NSCLC are largely unknown.<br \/><b>Methods: <\/b>Tumor genomic profiling, immune cell subsets assessment from standard haematoxylin\/eosin (H&#38;E) stained slides using machine learning, multiplexed immunofluorescence (CD8, PD1, PD-L1, Foxp3, CK7), and HLA-I immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed on matched pre and post ICI tumor biopsies from pts with NSCLC treated with ICI at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute who developed acquired resistance to ICI.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>Among 1823 pts with advanced NSCLC who received ICI, 80 developed acquired resistance to treatment and had matched pre- and post-ICI tissue samples for correlative analysis. Putative resistance mutations were identified in 27.3% of cases. The most common acquired loss-of-function mutations included <i>STK11<\/i> (9.1%), <i>B2M<\/i> (6.5%), <i>NF1\/2<\/i> (5.2%), <i>SMARCA4<\/i> (5.2%), <i>APC<\/i> (3.9%), <i>KEAP1<\/i> (2.6%), and <i>JAK1<\/i> (2.6%). In addition, acquired activating mutations were found in <i>PI3KCA<\/i> (3.9%) and <i>SOS1<\/i> (1.3%). In examining copy number variations (CNVs), we identified acquired CNVs in 49.3% (38\/77) of ICI-resistant samples, including heterozygous loss of <i>B2M<\/i> (23.4%), <i>STK11<\/i> (16.8%), <i>SMARCA4<\/i> (16.9%), <i>KEAP1<\/i> (15.6%), <i>PTEN<\/i> (10.4%), <i>CDKN2A<\/i>\/B (9.1%) and <i>PD<\/i>-<i>L1<\/i>\/<i>PD<\/i>-<i>L2<\/i> genes (9.1%), among others. Importantly, we also noted acquired homozygous deletions in <i>CDKN2A<\/i>\/B (9.1%), <i>PD<\/i>-<i>L1<\/i>\/<i>PD<\/i>-<i>L2<\/i> (1.3%) and <i>JAK2<\/i> (1.3%), and amplification in <i>MDM2<\/i> (5.2%), <i>KRAS<\/i> (3.9%) and <i>MYC<\/i> (2.6%), at the time of resistance to ICI. Among 16 cases with pre- and post-ICI H&#38;E stained slides, digital pathology analysis showed a significant decrease in the density of intratumoral lymphocytes in ICI-resistant tumor samples compared to pre-ICI samples (88 vs 36 cells\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>, P=0.03). Consistently, among 6 pts with pre- and post-ICI multiplexed immunofluorescence we observed a significant decrease in CD8+ PD1+ T cells in ICI-resistant vs pre-ICI tumor samples (24 vs 10 cells\/mm<sup>2<\/sup>, P=0.01). Among pts with tissue available for HLA-I IHC (N=9), we found a significant decrease in HLA-I expression by H-score at the time of acquired resistance (300 vs 260, P=0.03). In control cohorts of pts with pre- and post-chemotherapy (CT) (N=32) or targeted therapies (TT) (N=89) tumor genomic profiling no acquired mutations in <i>STK11<\/i>,<i> KEAP1, B2M, JAK1, APC, SOS1<\/i> were detected. Similarly, intervening chemotherapy and targeted therapies were not associated with changes in lymphocytes density and HLA-I expression.<br \/><b>Conclusion: <\/b>Mechanisms of acquired resistance to ICI are heterogenous, including both genomic and immunophenotypic factors. New therapeutic strategies are required to delay and overcome ICI resistance in pts with NSCLC.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Genetic factors,NSCLC,Therapy resistance,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Biagio Ricciuti<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Giuseppe Lamberti<sup>1<\/sup>, Sreekar Puchala<sup>2<\/sup>, Navin Mahadevan<sup>3<\/sup>, Joao Alessi<sup>1<\/sup>, Xinan Wang<sup>4<\/sup>, Yvonne Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Federica Pecci<sup>1<\/sup>, Alessandro Di Federico<sup>1<\/sup>, Malini Gandhi<sup>1<\/sup>, Adriana Barrichello<sup>1<\/sup>, Victor Vaz<sup>1<\/sup>, Andy Pangilinan<sup>1<\/sup>, Danielle Haradon<sup>1<\/sup>, Elinton Lee<sup>1<\/sup>, Hersh Gupta<sup>2<\/sup>, Mizuki Nishino<sup>5<\/sup>, Andrew Cherniack<sup>2<\/sup>, Scott Rodig<sup>6<\/sup>, Lynette Sholl<sup>1<\/sup>, Renato Umeton<sup>7<\/sup>, MArk  M.

A biomarker strategy which includes flow cytometry to generate pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic (PK\/PD) models for rational design of dose escalation and expansion of clinical studies, may need to consider concomitant drugs for checkpoint inhibition like Pembrolizumab.<br \/>Precision has optimized the use of commercial anti-PD-1 and anti-IgG4 reagents to detect both free PD-1 and\/or Pembro-bound PD-1 when patients are on study with a new molecular entity as either a monotherapy or in combination with concomitant checkpoint inhibitors. For I-O studies conventional efficacy endpoints combined with flow biomarker driven surrogate endpoints enhance therapeutic decisions for determining mechanism of action and biological response when incorporated in early-phase clinical studies. Precision developed and qualified a flow immunophenotyping assay to quantify PD-1 on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells using a commercial PD-1 clone (PD1.3.1.3) and an anti-IgG4. This enabled detection of both free and drug bound PD-1 receptor. We compared detection of PD-1 in PHA stimulated healthy donors treated with saturating Pembrolizumab or no drug treatment. There was not a significant difference observed in PD-1 quantification in the presence or absence of Pembrolizumab, which demonstrated that our approach was able to accurately measure total PD-1 whether free or bound. As Pembrolizumab was titrated from the saturating concentration there was a dose-dependent decrease in detection of PD-1. We have used this assay to detect PD-1 with several new I-O therapies that combined standard anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors, and in these clinical studies for advanced and rare solid tumor indications, we observed an average of 20-40% increase in PD-1 compared to no drug treatment.<br \/>Immuno-oncology clinical trials which incorporate checkpoint inhibitors like either PD-1 or PD-L1, the availability of commercial reagents are key considerations to detect these receptors when designing a sensitive, selective, and accurate biomarker assay.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-1,Pembrolizumab,Flow cytometry,Checkpoint Inhibitors,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Venkat Mohanram<sup><\/sup>, Ming Yang<sup><\/sup>, <b>Angelina Bisconte<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Deborah Phippard<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Precision for Medicine, Frederick, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d5fd7282-1612-4060-bea1-4f2ac2d3b0d4","ControlNumber":"7802","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;V.

However, it is unclear if there is an association between abundance of TIGIT expressing immune cells in tumor microenvironment and effectiveness of TIGIT-based intervention. This study utilizes an exploratory novel duplex immunohistochemical (IHC) assay to assess if the distribution patterns and\/or the abundance of TIGIT-positive immune cells are related to the expression levels of TIGIT&#8217;s receptor PVR in tumor.<br \/>Methods: Individual formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded surgical resections and tissue microarray cores of 75 cervical, 84 esophageal, 79 non-small cell lung , and 81 small cell lung carcinoma specimens were stained using a duplex chromogenic IHC assay that detects PVR and TIGIT sequentially on a single slide. The slides were examined for (1) overall intensity and percentage of tumor staining positive for PVR, (2) percentage of tumor area occupied by TIGIT-expressing immune cells, and (3) distribution pattern of TIGIT-positive cells. For each specimen, overall PVR intensity was multiplied by percentage of tumor positive for PVR to generate the PVR Expression Score.<br \/>Results: PVR and TIGIT staining at any intensity was widely observed in all four tumor types ranging from 91% to 100% of specimens positive for PVR and 77% to 100% of specimens positive for TIGIT. Little to no differences in the average percentages of PVR tumor positivity or TIGIT tumor area positivity were found among the four tumor types. However, individual tumor specimens differed widely in these two parameters. Among all 319 tumor specimens evaluated, the percentages of tumor expressing PVR at any intensity ranged from 0 to 100% with approximately 1\/3 of the specimens having less than 50% and 3% showing no PVR expression. Percentages of tumor area occupied by TIGIT-positive cells ranged from 0% to 30% with approximately 40% of the specimens having less than 1%. Distribution patterns of TIGIT-expressing cells in each specimen was classified as peritumoral, intratumoral, or mixed. Specimens classified as peritumoral exhibited higher PVR Expression Scores than those classified as intratumoral. Specimens classified as having a mixed TIGIT-positive cell distribution pattern had an average PVR Expression Score that was intermediate between specimens having intratumoral and peritumoral TIGIT distribution patterns. Interestingly, no correlation was found between tumor PVR Expression Scores and abundance of TIGIT expressing cells in tumor area.<br \/>Conclusion: The correlation between high tumor PVR expression levels and peritumoral distribution patterns of TIGIT-positive cells suggests PVR\/TIGIT signaling pathway activation status could be important in infiltration of T cells into tumor parenchyma.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"TIGIT,CD155,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sara  A.

Both the antibodies have IgG4 backbone but vary considerably in terms of the PD-1 epitopes they bind to.. Given that there is almost no overlap between the PD-1 binding sites there is a definite possibility of nuanced drug-dependent differences in patient response to treatment. These differences would not be possible to discern unless the same patient with the same tumor microenvironment were evaluated with both drugs simultaneously. We attempted to address this question using the near native Farcast<sup>TM<\/sup> TruTumor histoculture platform. Fresh surgically resected Head and Neck squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) samples (n=8) along with matched blood were collected from consented patients. The tumor sample was processed to generate explants that were distributed into arms. These arms were treated in culture with P (32.9 &#181;g\/ml) or N (132 &#181;g\/ml) for 72 hours. The response was characterized using histopathology, cytokine release and flow cytometry. T-cell re-invigoration was assessed by evaluating Interferon gamma release while a decrease in tumor content and\/or increase in cleaved Caspase expression was correlated with tumor cytotoxicity Pre-treatment cytokine levels across control and both treatment arms were equivalent (z-score &#60;1.5) across all samples. Additionally, when treated with the same drugs in duplicate arms similar tumor cytotoxic response was observed in the replicate arms (n=1). These data established arm equivalence. Post treatment with N or P, 6 out of 8 samples exhibited a T-cells reinvigoration phenotype. Of the remaining 2 samples, one exhibited tumor cytotoxicity with both treatments while the other showed tumor cytotoxicity only on N treatment. We evaluated the 6 samples that exhibited T-cell re-invigoration response further to understand the subtle differences in response to either N or P. While the response trends were similar for both drugs, the rate of response, as evaluated by significant increase in cleaved caspase-3 or decrease in tumor content, seem to be different in 3 samples. These 3 samples responded better with P compared to N.In this study, we broadly observed equivalent response to both the drugs with some patient samples responding slightly better to one over the other. Further studies are required to tease out the molecular reasons for these nuanced differences in response to these two anti-PD1 treatments. The FarcastTM<\/sup> TruTumor platform provides the unique opportunity to make personalized choice of the drug treatment that might provide best response in a patient.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Pembrolizumab,Nivolumab,Personalized medicine,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Satish Sankaran<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Biswajit Das<sup>1<\/sup>, Kowshik Jaganathan<sup>1<\/sup>, Gowri Shankar K<sup>1<\/sup>, Jayaprakash C<sup>2<\/sup>, Ganesh MS<sup>3<\/sup>, Amritha Prabha<sup>3<\/sup>, Vijay Pillai<sup>4<\/sup>, Syamkumar V<sup>1<\/sup>, Chandan Bhowal<sup>1<\/sup>, Rajashekar M<sup>1<\/sup>, Oliyarasi M<sup>1<\/sup>, Ritu Malhotra<sup>1<\/sup>, Govindraj K<sup>1<\/sup>, Nandini Pal Basak<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Farcast Biosciences, Bangalore, India,<sup>2<\/sup>DBR & SK Superspeciality Hospital, Tirupati, India,<sup>3<\/sup>Vydehi Multi Specialty Hospital, Bangalore, India,<sup>4<\/sup>Mazumdar Shaw Medical Centre, Bangalore, India","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"3082310b-f22a-4f35-a5e7-54a7b3404832","ControlNumber":"7128","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

Different T cell subsets may have opposing roles in tumor progression, especially in inflammatory cancers such as colorectal cancer (CRC). In different series of studies, we performed extensive characterization and critical analyses of T regulatory cell (Treg)-related markers and key inhibitory immune checkpoints (ICs) in CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell subsets in the TME and periphery of CRC patients. We found a significant increase in levels of CD4<sup>+<\/sup>FoxP3<sup>+<\/sup>Helios<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, which represent potentially highly immunosuppressive Tregs, in the TME. Additionally, tumor-infiltrating CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells upregulated PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM-3 and LAG-3 immune checkpoints. CTLA-4, TIM-3, and LAG-3 were mainly co-expressed on FoxP3<sup>+<\/sup>Helios<sup>+<\/sup> Tregs in the TME. Additionally, we found that FoxP3 expression and ICs including PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, and LAG-3 were significantly upregulated in tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. We then investigated associations between different tumor-infiltrating CD4<sup>+<\/sup> and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell subpopulations and disease-free survival (DFS). Interestingly, a high frequency of circulating CD4<sup>+<\/sup>FoxP3<sup>+<\/sup> Tregs was associated with poorer DFS, while higher frequency of these cells in the TME was associated with better DFS. Additionally, high frequencies of circulating CD4<sup>+<\/sup>FoxP3<sup>+<\/sup>Helios<sup>+<\/sup> Tregs and tumor-infiltrating CD4<sup>+<\/sup>FoxP3<sup>-<\/sup>Helios<sup>-<\/sup> T cells were associated with poorer DFS. Moreover, a high frequency of CD4<sup>+<\/sup>FoxP3<sup>+<\/sup>Helios<sup>-<\/sup>PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> Tregs in circulation was associated with worse DFS.

The positive predictive value of this assay, however, is less than ideal as a high PD-L1 score does not necessarily associate with a good response, and a good response may be seen with a low or negative PD-L1 score. In principle, this could be due to lack of accuracy and\/or precision of the assay, as well as biological factors, such as variable expression across tumor cells and interacting immune cells. In this study, we describe a digital image analysis algorithm to address assay-related problems and improve both accuracy and precision, as well as improve identification of PD-L1 expression in differing cell populations of the tumor microenvironment. In addition, we propose a panel of assays that in aggregate might reveal inherent heterogeneity among cases with similar PD-L1 score and thus provide vital context underlying the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors in the clinic. Here we show that applying novel machine-learning based digital image analysis to multiplex assays together with digital scoring of PD-L1 provides an accurate and precise assessment of the real-world tumor milieu that we hypothesize will help establish the immunophenotypes that inform therapeutic efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors. We have additionally interrogated whether expression of PD-L1 in these groups are consistent with known molecular patterns assayed using novel methodologies, such as high-plex digital spatial transcriptomics through the nanoString GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) platform and assessed the ability of the different digital platforms to provide concordant data relating to real-world expression patterns of PD-L1 and associated biomarkers. Thus, our results point to the importance of robust methodologies, used in combination, to evaluate complex tumor immune landscapes and the advantages of digital analyses to provide accurate and precise clinical contexts for better patient outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-L1,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Clara Troccoli<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Lauren Matelski<sup><\/sup>, Adam Beharry<sup><\/sup>, Vanessa Ly<sup><\/sup>, Morgan Wambaugh<sup><\/sup>, Melanie Amen<sup><\/sup>, Will Paces<sup><\/sup>, Geoffrey Metcalf<sup><\/sup>, Roberto Gianani<sup><\/sup>, Tom Turi<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Flagship Biosciences, Broomfield, CO","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"d8f3ff0b-fc17-42fd-96ed-6f69b8c8be2e","ControlNumber":"4723","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

These tumors are universally refractory to immune checkpoint therapies (ICT). While poor T cell infiltration has been partly ascribed to low tumor mutational burden (TMB), TMB doesn&#8217;t necessarily exclude immunogenic responses nor ensure a response to ICT. Mechanisms of T cell exclusion in tumors with sufficient TMB may be caused by molecular failure of the antigen processing and presentation (APP), which impacts T cell generation. It was previously described that loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of an essential component of the MHC class I molecule, the beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), is associated with low antigen presentation, tumor T cell infiltration, and ICT resistance in melanoma. Here we provide further insight into APP and ICT response in melanoma.<br \/>Methods: Transcriptomic analysis and visualization of genomic data from the GDC-TCGA skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) study were performed using the Xena platform. Four anti-PD1 metastatic melanoma cohorts were normalized with transcripts per million units. STRING protein-protein interaction analysis was performed in the human database with 11 nodes and 39 edges. Nanostring transcriptomic data from metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM) was revisited from our previous publications for <i>Spearman&#8217;s<\/i> correlational and group analysis of APP signatures amongst ICT responders and non-responders.<br \/>Results: In an expanded analysis of 4 normalized anti-PD1 treated metastatic melanoma cohorts (n=272), we confirmed that transcriptomic levels of <i>B2M<\/i> are significantly reduced in non-responders. Moreover, STRING protein-protein interaction analysis of B2M revealed CD1D as a potential molecular partner of B2M. We, therefore, observed that <i>CD1D<\/i> transcriptomic expression is not only reduced in anti-PD1 poor responders but is a survival prognosticator in primary tumors from the GDC-TCGA study. Interestingly, <i>CD1D<\/i> expression is also significantly reduced in poorly immunogenic mUM tumors, a cancer type regarded as universally refractory to ICT.<br \/>Conclusions: These findings suggest that APP faults in ICT-resistant tumors are not restricted to faults in peptide presentation to T lymphocytes (via B2M) but may also impact the presentation of tumor-associated lipid and glycolipid antigens via CD1d, which can impact antitumor responses of natural killer T cells (NKT). Adjuvant therapies that restore MHC-I and CD1d-mediated antigen presentation may unleash the response to ICT via NKT. Understanding CD1d expression faults locally and systemically may provide valuable prognostication information likely to impact how cancer is treated by optimally selecting patients for ICT and validating novel therapeutic targets for immunotherapy development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Melanoma\/skin cancers,Immune checkpoint blockade,Resistance,Antigen presentation,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Carlos Rogerio Figueiredo<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Faculty of Medicine \/ Medical Immune Oncology Research Group, University of Turku, Turku, Finland","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"ce8a735a-bda0-4ca5-a465-734e892ab805","ControlNumber":"3492","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>C.

Immune-checkpoint inhibitors can be administered in multiple solid tumor types. Currently available biomarkers, like the expression of PD-L1 or tumor mutational burden, miss a significant proportion of patients who could benefit from the therapy. Our goal was to set up a database consisting of both gene expression and clinical response data and to uncover the most significant biomarkers of response to anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapies.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>. The GEO repository was screened to identify datasets with simultaneously available transcriptomic and clinical response data across different solid tumor types. The screening focused on studies involving the administration of nivolumab (anti-PD-1), pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1), atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1), durvalumab (anti-PD-L1), and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4). Mann-Whitney U-test and receiver operating characteristic analysis were performed across all genes to identify features related to therapy response. False discovery rate was computed to correct for multiple hypothesis testing.<br \/><b>Results<\/b>. The database that we established consists of 1,439 unique tumor samples from nineteen datasets with gastric-, lung-, esophageal-, head, neck-, and urothelial cancers, and malignant melanoma. The strongest upregulated candidates linked to resistance in anti-PD-1 treated tumors were PRXL2A (AUC=0.771), ODR4 (AUC=0.734), and RBM15B (AUC=0.734). The most robust hits in the anti-PD-L1 treated cohort were NOTCH3 (AUC=0.639), NECTIN1 (AUC=0.631) and ITGAV (AUC=0.63). In the anti-CTLA-4 treatment cohort C5orf24 (AUC=0.76) was the most promising candidate. We have also established a portal for additional analysis and ranking of further biomarker candidates by extending our previously established ROC plotter. The immunotherapy-treated transcriptomic database is accessible at the website www.rocplot.com\/immune.<br \/><b>Discussion<\/b>. An integrated database and an online platform were set up to validate potential biomarkers of immunotherapy response in a sizeable cohort of cancer samples from multiple tumor types.

Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) treatment may alter the tumor micro-environment, converting an immune &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor into an immune &#8220;hot&#8221; tumor, triggering an adaptive immune response and abscopal effect. We evaluated PEF in combination with anti-PD1 in a highly aggressive orthotopic triple negative breast tumor mouse model.<br \/>Methods: Murine mammary 4T1 cells (2x10<sup>5<\/sup>) non-responsive to anti-PD1 therapy were orthotopically implanted in mammary fat of 48 female Balb\/C mice. Once tumors were established (5 mm diameter), mice were randomized into six groups: Sham+IgG controls, aPD-1-only, PEF (1X), PEF (2X), aPD-1 + PEF (1X), and aPD-1 + PEF (2X). Groups 4 and 6 received two PEF treatments, five days apart. Anti-PD1 and isotype matched control IgG was administered (200 ug, intraperitoneal) weekly, starting 3 days after PEF treatment. Tumor volumes were recorded 3x\/week and standard survival analyses were conducted per IACUC protocol. In the cohort of tumors collected 30 days after PEF, flow cytometry (FC) evaluated T-cell immune infiltrates and associated markers. Blood was collected at different time points to evaluate systemic immunological response. Tumor-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL) were isolated from tumor-infiltrating and circulating lymphocytes by gp70 MHC tetramer formation assay.<br \/>Results: Single PEF reduced tumor growth compared to IgG and aPD-1-only groups by 65% and 62%, respectively. Double PEF treatment reduced tumor growth by 74% and prolonged survival. FC demonstrated circulating helper T-cells and CTL frequency was increased two weeks post-PEF compared to the control group. The tetramer detected substantial increases in antigen-specific T-cell populations in both single and double PEF treatment groups. PEF groups had significant tumor and spleen infiltration of CD8 and CD4 T-cells, including increased tetramer levels. Anti-PD1-only animals showed no meaningful reductions in tumor growth, prolonged survival, or significant changes in CD8, CD4 T cells or in the tetramer assay.<br \/>Conclusions: PEF treatments prior to initiation of anti-PD1 in orthotopic 4T1 mouse model triggers a tumor-specific adaptive immune response in an immune &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor model, irrespective of anti-PD-1 therapy. PEF increases circulating and tumor-infiltrating T-cells and antigen-specific T-cells, with these effects observed after a single or two treatments with PEF. Collectively, our results demonstrate that PEF treatment prior to initiation of anti-PD1 treatment can reduce tumor growth, prolong survival, and activate an adaptive immune response in an immune &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor. These findings suggest that PEF treatment merits further evaluation in IO-non-responsive cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Preclinical,Anti-PD-1,Immuno-oncology,Breast cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ebtesam Nafie<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Mukta Wagh<sup>1<\/sup>, Chiara Pastori<sup>1<\/sup>, Mo Trikha<sup>2<\/sup>, Robert Neal<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Immuno-oncology, Galvanize Therapeutics Inc, San Carlos, CA,<sup>2<\/sup>Immunology, Apple Tree Partners, San Fransisco, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"2f57c23f-2e88-4ccd-806a-07727f302561","ControlNumber":"3891","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>E.

The expression of GALV-GP-R- potentiates immunogenic tumor cell death through the induction of cell-to-cell fusion. CD40L enhances dendritic cell and macrophage activation and 4-1BBL promotes CD8+ T-cell activation and co-stimulation. The anti-CTLA-4 antibody-like molecule blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands B7.1 and B7.2, further enhancing T cell activation. RP3 is currently being assessed in a Phase 1 clinical trial with or without nivolumab in patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT04735978).<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> CD1 nude mice with A375 melanoma xenograft tumors (Group 1) were treated with a single intratumoral injection of 1x10<sup>7<\/sup> PFU\/mL of RP3.

CD24 is over-expressed on tumor cells and can help them avoid being engulfed by macrophages through its interaction with Siglec-10 expressed by TAM. ATG-031 is a humanized anti-CD24 monoclonal antibody that binds to CD24 with high affinity and specificity and blocks the interaction of CD24 with Siglec-10 on macrophages, enhancing macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of tumor cells. In this study, we evaluated the <i>in vivo<\/i> efficacy of ATG-031 and explored its pharmacodynamic effects.<br \/>Methods: C57BL\/6J mice were inoculated with wild-type (WT) MC38 cells on the left flank and MC38 cells that express human CD24 (MC38-hCD24) on the right flank. When the average tumor volume reached 120 to 140 mm<sup>3<\/sup> for MC38-hCD24, mice were treated with vehicle control (PBS) or ATG-031 at 3 mg\/kg intravenously twice a week for four doses. A group of mice inoculated with only MC38 tumor cells was set as the control and treated with ATG-031 by the same way. Tumor volume was measured twice a week to evaluate the efficacy of ATG-031. Tumor samples were isolated at the endpoint of this efficacy study, and a multiplex IHC staining was performed to evaluate the change of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in response to ATG-031.<br \/>Results: ATG-031 treatment significantly inhibited the tumor growth of MC38-hCD24 on the right flank of mice with a tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 60.52%. Interestingly, although the WT MC38 tumor on the left flank did not express the antigen, human CD24, ATG-031 still demonstrated efficacy in controlling the tumor growth with a TGI of 21.17%. Without the co-inoculation of MC38-hCD24, ATG-031 did not affect the WT MC38 tumor growth in the control group. Multiplex IHC staining revealed that the proportion of M1 macrophage increased in response to ATG-031 treatment, not only in MC38-hCD24 tumors but also in WT MC38 tumors on the left flank.<br \/>Conclusions: ATG-031, a first-in-class anti-CD24 antibody, demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity <i>in vivo<\/i>, re-polarizing M2-like TAM to anti-tumor M1 subtype in the TME and induced systemic anti-tumor immunity. A clinical study to investigate the safety and efficacy of ATG-031 in cancer patients is being developed.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,Macrophages,Tumor microenvironment,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Peng Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Min Deng<sup>1<\/sup>, Yun Liu<sup>1<\/sup>, Jiamei Luo<sup>1<\/sup>, Linjie Tian<sup>2<\/sup>, Jay Mei<sup>3<\/sup>, Bo Shan<sup>3<\/sup>, <b>Bing Hou<\/b><sup>3<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Antengene Corporation Limited, Shanghai, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Antengene Biotech LLC, Doylestown, PA,<sup>3<\/sup>Antengene Corporation, Shaoxing, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"a420753c-c0ec-4d3b-ae25-9473c18de5f9","ControlNumber":"3359","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;P.

NCCN guidelines (NCCN v5.2022) recommend against PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy in the second-line setting for <i>ALK <\/i>fusion+ non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) due to lack of efficacy, irrespective of tumoral PD-L1 expression. We observed high LAG3 protein expression by multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) in postmortem <i>ALK<\/i> fusion-positive tumor tissue samples from 3 RTD donors who were treated with ALK inhibitors. Further studies are recommended to investigate the therapeutic potential of LAG3 inhibitors in this patient population.<br \/>Case Series: Of the 38 patients with lung cancer tissue collected by RTD, 3 patients had <i>ALK <\/i>fusion and were treated with ALK inhibitors. Despite the initial response, all 3 patients succumbed to the disease. Tissue samples were collected from primary and multiple metastatic sites after death. Immune checkpoint markers, including LAG3, were quantitated via multiplex immunofluorescence staining, and genomic analyses were performed.<br \/>Results: Analysis of two tissue microarrays comprised of 130 tumor cores from multiple tissue sites of the first 10 NSCLC RTD donors revealed that 66% of tumor cores had &#62;1% LAG3 expression in CD3+ T cells. Among the three patients with <i>ALK<\/i> fusion-positive NSCLC, 83% (5 of 6 cores), 85% (6 of 7 cores), and 100% (18 of 18 cores) of the tissue cores had &#62;1% LAG3 expression in T cells. The median LAG3 expression in T cells measured by mIF was 1.8% in 99 tumor cores from the <i>ALK<\/i> fusion-negative study cohort versus 7.3% in the 31 cores from the <i>ALK<\/i> fusion-positive subset (p=0.004). Postmortem genomic analyses revealed an <i>ALK<\/i> p.L1196M resistance mutation in the first patient and an <i>AGK-BRAF<\/i> fusion in the 2<sup>nd<\/sup> patient. No known ALK-TKI resistance mutations were detected in the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> patient.<br \/>Discussion: High-quality post-therapy tumor samples collected by the RTD program enable the investigation of genomic and potential immune-related resistance mechanisms. Such studies can inform potential targets for drug development and the study of new therapies to overcome treatment resistance. Our observation of high LAG3 expression in 3 RTD donors with <i>ALK <\/i>fusion-positive NSCLC suggests the need for further studies to explore the potential for LAG3 inhibitors in patients with NSCLC whose tumors develop resistance to ALK inhibitors.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,ALK,Immune checkpoint blockade,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hilal Ozakinci<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Gina Nazario<sup><\/sup>, Karina Colossi Furlan<sup><\/sup>, Dung-Tsa Chen<sup><\/sup>, Trevor Rose<sup><\/sup>, Matthew  B.

However, the intrinsic complexity of the immunological models and the variable drug responses among different cancer types have become the most prominent challenges. To facilitate large scale research projects and drug discovery of immune checkpoint inhibitors, we conducted a comprehensive protein profiling of ATCC&#8217;s vast portfolio of human tumor and immune cell lines for several established and novel immune checkpoint molecules. Based on this protein profiling data, we generated immune checkpoint reporter cancer cell lines with high expression of endogenous immune checkpoint molecule ligands (PD-L1, CD155, and B7-H3). The reporter system contains a gamma interferon activation site (GAS)-response element upstream of the luciferase gene, preventing luciferase expression when the immune checkpoint molecule ligand binds to its corresponding receptor that suppresses T cell-mediated antitumor activity. In the presence of a relevant immune checkpoint inhibitor, a luciferase expression-based bioluminescent signal is produced, which can be readily detected and quantitated to evaluate the efficacy, potency, and dynamics of the inhibitor. Our data showed that the bioluminescence in the reporter cancer cells increased approximately 100-250 folds in a dose-dependent manner in response to interferon gamma stimulation, which mimics the signaling from activated CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. The bioluminescence increased approximately 50-100 folds in response to CD8+ primary T cell-conditioned media stimulation. In particular, we observed up to 5-fold increase in luciferase signal from our PD-L1 reporter cell line in response to co-culture with CD8+ primary T cells in the presence of an anti-PD-L1 blocking antibody in a dose-dependent manner. The luciferase expression and endogenous immune checkpoint molecule ligand expression were well maintained after the cell lines had reached &#62;30 population doubling level. These results highlight the robustness and responsiveness of the reporter system for the assessment of T cell-mediated immune responses triggered by checkpoint inhibitors. These immune checkpoint reporter cancer cell lines yield exceptional in vitro and ex vivo assay sensitivity and reproducibility, while simplify the complex immunological model by providing physiologically relevant expression of immune checkpoint molecule ligands, in comparison to similar assays with an artificial checkpoint ligand overexpression system.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,PD-L1,Cell lines,TIGIT,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hyeyoun Chang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Kevin Tyo<sup><\/sup>, John Foulke<sup><\/sup>, Luping Chen<sup><\/sup>, Zhizhan Gu<sup><\/sup>, Fang Tian<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>ATCC, Gaithersburg, MD","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"307f3bd3-48c9-4e0c-8847-9756c36915ed","ControlNumber":"7471","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

Mouse models have demonstrated that ICIs can decrease ovarian follicular reserve and impair oocyte maturation, which may have implications for fertility (PMID: 36008687). There are no studies investigating the effect of ICIs on fertility in humans. We sought to evaluate ovarian function in women treated with ICIs compared to untreated women by evaluating non-invasive surrogate markers of ovarian reserve, anti-m&#252;llerian hormone (AMH) and antral follicle counts (AFC).<b> <\/b>We enrolled women 18 - 40 years old diagnosed with stage III or IV melanoma. Participants underwent phlebotomy for AMH levels and a pelvic ultrasound to assess AFC. The medical record was retrospectively reviewed to obtain data on patient characteristics, treatments, and outcomes.<b><\/b> A total of 14 patients with stage IIIA - IV melanoma participated. Six patients received ICI treatment before AMH and AFC testing while 8 had no prior ICI exposure. The ICI group ages ranged from 22-40 years with a median age of 31 years. The untreated group ages ranged from 25-39 years with a median age of 32 years. The time between starting an ICI and enrolling in the study ranged from 28 - 351 days. ICI regimens included ipilimumab\/nivolumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab (on a clinical trial). Four of these six patients experienced an irAE during their course, including: dermatitis, hepatitis, colitis, thyroid dysfunction, and adrenal insufficiency. Median AMH levels were lower for patients treated with ICIs (2.9 vs 4.0 ng\/mL), as was median AFC (22.5 vs 23.5 ng\/mL). Only three patients&#8217; clinicians discussed fertility preservation. None of the patients underwent fertility preservation. Our study found lower AMH and AFC in women with melanoma who were treated with an ICI compared to untreated women. Although AMH and AFC are surrogate markers for ovarian reserve and fertility, and our study is a small cohort, these early results suggest that ICIs may impact ovarian function. Age is less likely to be a confounding factor as the median age of the treated group was younger than the untreated group. While these results are preliminary, when considered in conjunction with recent pre-clinical data showing changes within the ovaries after ICI treatment, fertility consultation should be considered for young women prior to ICI initiation. We are investigating associations between AMH, AFC, age, ICI exposure, and future pregnancies in an ongoing prospective study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Melanoma\/skin cancers,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Ashley Hickman<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Katherine Smith<sup>1<\/sup>, Zaraq Khan<sup>2<\/sup>, Elizabeth Ann Enninga<sup>3<\/sup>, Yulian Zhao<sup>2<\/sup>, Elizabeth Cathcart-Rake<sup>1<\/sup>, Haidong Dong<sup>4<\/sup>, Lisa Kottschade<sup>1<\/sup>, Svetomir Markovic<sup>1<\/sup>, Heather Montane<sup>1<\/sup>, Anastasios Dimou<sup>1<\/sup>, Yiyi Yan<sup>5<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Mayo Clinic Medical Oncology, Rochester, MN,<sup>2<\/sup>Mayo Clinic Obstetrics and Gynecology, Rochester, MN,<sup>3<\/sup>Mayo Clinic Research Services, Rochester, MN,<sup>4<\/sup>Mayo Clinic Urology, Rochester, MN,<sup>5<\/sup>Mayo Clinic Medical Oncology, Jacksonville, FL","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"86bd19f2-c88f-4ed2-aaa8-b4616a86ca29","ControlNumber":"7987","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

We anticipate this tool will identify candidate novel drug targets and biomarkers for immunotherapy in cancer.<br \/>Methods: The user selects a gene of interest (GOI) as input for the pipeline. The pipeline searches TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) mutation and structural variant outputs to collect hits in the gene of interest. Each sample with an alteration in the GOI is annotated with the alteration&#8217;s predicted biological function (loss-of-function or LOF vs gain-of-function or GOF) using gene set enrichment analysis and pathway analysis from RNA sequencing. After annotating by sample, the alterations themselves are scored and recorded. Next, Quantiseq and Trust4 are employed to estimate features of the immune microenvironment in both the LOF and GOF samples. These results along with cancer type distributions, genomic position maps, and oncoplots are delivered to the user for further investigation. We are creating an online application to provide these results to the public. Simultaneously, a command line tool is being developed for application to any data source.<br \/>Results: We will present findings for the pipeline using positive controls including genomic alterations in ADAR, MTAP, IDH1, and CD274 (PD-L1). Preliminarily, we identified candidate GOF mutations (n=81) in PD-L1 that have inflamed tumor immune microenvironments like those of samples with known GOF structural variations in PD-L1. These samples have an overall &#8220;hot&#8221; immune microenvironment with significantly (p&#60;.05) increased M1 macrophages, increased expression of IFN-gamma, and decreased M2 macrophages.<br \/>Conclusion: Currently there are no systematic approaches to interrogate individual genomic alterations and their association with an altered immune microenvironment. Our approach is pragmatic for any gene of interest, can be applied to any database, and identifies clinically actionable targets. This approach will identify heretofore unstudied connections between genomic alterations and immune microenvironment and support personalized drug development strategies in immuno-oncology.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Multiomics,Bioinformatics,Mutation detection,Microenvironment,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Raven Vella<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Emily  L.

However, durable remission and objective response rates with ICB monotherapy remain low. Several immune resistance mechanisms have been revealed and used to develop combinational therapy. In consideration of the durable and impressive responses observed in &#8216;hot&#8217; tumors, it will be valuable to make an endeavor to elucidate the tumor evasion mechanisms. Despite the well-established mechanisms in immunotherapy resistance, our study uncovered a new mechanism of tumor immune evasion through the RNA-binding protein HuR\/CD147 axis. The RNA-binding protein Hu antigen R (HuR) is overexpressed in a variety of cancers and promotes tumorigenesis by interacting with a subset of oncogenic mRNAs. The tumor-associated antigen CD147, a highly glycosylated transmembrane immunoglobulin, is widely and specifically expressed in multiple malignancies. We phenotypically observed the downregulation of CD147 in HuR-deficient cells and elucidated that HuR regulates <i>CD147<\/i> mRNA via binding to the AU-rich elements of its 3' UTR. The direct binding of HuR to <i>CD147<\/i> mRNA in multiple types of cells was validated by Ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation (RNP-IP) and RNA pulldown assay. These data together clarify HuR is engaged in <i>CD147<\/i> post-transcription regulation. KH-39 is a HuR-specific small molecule inhibitor, which disrupts the HuR function by competing for the binding site with its target mRNAs. KH-39 treatment reduced CD147 level in a time-\/dose-dependent manner. We also tested the anti-tumor action of HuR small molecular inhibitor KH-39 in tumor proliferation, clonogenicity, cell death, cytokine secretion, and <i>in vivo<\/i> tumor growth. The cytokine array assay indicated multiple immune-related cytokines changed after HuR inhibition and CD147 knockdown, including IL-6, which is proven to act as an immunomodulating agent in the tumor microenvironment. These data demonstrated the potential mechanism of overcoming immunoresistance by inhibiting the HuR\/CD147\/IL-6 axis. To test the combination strategy using HuR inhibitor and anti-PD-1 antibody in vivo, we established the EMT6 orthotopic mouse breast cancer model. A combination of HuR inhibitor KH-39 and anti-PD-1 antibody enhanced the anti-PD1 immunotherapy response and prolonged survival compared to the single agent group. Taken together, we preliminarily explored the HuR\/CD147\/IL-6 axis in tumor immune evasion, which might be a promising therapeutic target to overcome immune evasion and improve immunotherapy response in cancer. This finding may have reference significance for clinical cancer therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint blockade,HuR,CD147,IL-6,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Qi Zhang<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Lauren Dandreo<sup><\/sup>, Xiaoqing Wu<sup><\/sup>, Liang Xu<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Molecular Biosciences, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"83f15124-334f-4b1e-9d3b-be869b89d2f4","ControlNumber":"4690","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Q.

We have established a patient-derived tumor explant (PDE) model to monitor immune activation within a structurally preserved TME, following <i>ex vivo<\/i> incubation with immune check point inhibitors (ICI). When testing anti-PD-1 agents, such as dostarlimab and pembrolizumab, in a cohort of NSCLC explants from stage I-III treatment-na&#239;ve patients, we observed that approximately half demonstrate release of inflammatory cytokines after two days incubation. Interestingly, responsive tumors presented with a high level of PD-L1 expression (high TPS), had elevated TMB, and were highly infiltrated by CD8+ T cells at baseline, in line with tumor baseline characteristics predictive of clinical response to anti-PD-1. When testing a dose-range of dostarlimab and pembrolizumab comparable potencies were observed when measuring cytokine release after treatment of the NSCLC explants. In conclusion, we describe here an <i>in vitro<\/i> patient-derived NSCLC model that mirrors the heterogeneity of patients&#8217; response for anti-PD-1 agents observed in clinical settings, representing a valuable tool for comparative analysis of novel ICI assets and combinations, such as the CD226 axis members.

We hypothesized that immune contexture including spatial distribution of cells expressing immune molecules in the tumor microenvironment may predict immunotherapy outcome. Methods: Primary CRC tissues from consecutive patients with d-MMR metastatic CRC (N=33) were treated with anti-PD-1 antibodies at Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center (2015-2018). Tumors were stained for PD-L1, PD-1, CD8, CD3, CD68, LAG3, TGF&#946;R2, MHC-I, CD14, B2M, DAPI and pan-cytokeratin in 5 compartments (overall tumor, tumor epithelia, tumor stroma, peritumor inside vs outside) by multiplex immunofluorescence with digital image analysis. Features computed within each image analysis region included positive cell density, fraction of positive cell types, intensity of positive cells, and spatial distribution between distinct cell types (distances measured using image analysis software). Prior to model fitting, feature selection was performed using regularized Cox regression with LASSO. Regularization parameter was chosen based on 5-fold cross validation. A Cox proportional hazards model was fitted to predict patient progression-free survival (PFS).<br \/>Results: Among patients with d-MMR CRCs, 16\/33 (48.4%) were female, 10 received first-line ICI therapy, and 23 had received <u>&#62;<\/u> 1 prior chemotherapy regimen. Median age was 61.6 years (IQR of 49.4, 73.7). Eight patients (24.2%) harbored BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup>, 9 (27.2%) had mutant KRAS, and median PFS was 22.2 months (95% CI: 11.8, NR) with 20 events. PD-L1 was expressed in tumor cells, CD68<sup>+<\/sup> macrophages, and CD3<sup>+<\/sup> T lymphocytes. PD-1 expression on CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T lymphocytes was also observed. By univariate analysis, only cell-cell distance readouts achieved statistical significance. Multivariable feature selection identified the mean number of PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> cells within 10 microns of a PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup> cell in the overall tumor as the strongest predictor of anti-PD-1 efficacy, and was significantly associated with PFS (HR=0.87, 95% CI: 0.79-0.95, p&#60; 0.001). In contrast, the ratio of PD-1<sup>+<\/sup>\/PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup> cells was not predictive of treatment efficacy (p= 0.47), thereby underscoring the importance of spatial distribution for PFS prediction.<br \/>Conclusion: The mean number of PD-1<sup>+<\/sup> cells in proximity to PD-L1<sup>+<\/sup> cells in tumors was a predictive biomarker of anti-PD-1 efficacy.

Much of that revolution in immuno-oncology has been fueled by the clinical success of immune checkpoint inhibitors, targeting cytokines, antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity and complement dependent cytotoxicity via the T cell activation. Reaction biology has established state-of-art high throughput screening procedures for measuring the ability of new Biologics or compounds to activate T cells. Antibody Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity (ADCC), T cell activation assay (NFAT), immune checkpoint inhibitor assay (PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade bioassay), cytokines activation assay and Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC) are commonly used for drug discovery industry. ADCC is a desirable mechanism for killing target cells using antibody-based drugs. T cell activation assay can be used for the discovery and development of novel biologics and cell therapies aimed at inducing, strengthening and\/or engineering T cell response. Blocking of immune inhibitory receptors by their respective ligands on an adjacent cell inhibits TCR mediated proliferation, transcriptional activation and cytokines production. Biologics or compounds designed for measuring the stimulatory or inhibitory function of cytokines are promising in the field of immune oncology. Reaction Biology developed biochemical assays for PD-1\/PD-L1, CTLA4\/CD80 and CTLA4\/CD86 to screen immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) designed to block immune inhibitory receptors PD-1 and CTLA-4 have shown unprecedented efficacy in cancer treatment. This led to rapid expansion of mAb discovery programs to many more IC receptors including members of the T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) - CD112R - CD96 Axis. TIGIT binds to its ligands CD155 (PVR) and CD112 (PVRL2) while CD112R (PVRIG) binds to CD112 and CD96 (TACTILE) binds to CD155. Binding of TIGIT\/CD112R to CD155\/CD112 inhibits the co-stimulatory activity of the paired receptor CD226. Human CD96 can have co-stimulatory or co-inhibitory activity based on the cell type and context. Thus, therapeutic targeting of this axis can modulate T cell and NK cell activation and unleash anti-cancer immunity. One of the bottlenecks of immunotherapy mAb development is the lack of quantitative and reproducible bioassays for functional analysis and potency determination. Existing methods rely heavily on primary immune cells, which is labor- and cost-intensive and highly variable. To address this need, we developed a panel of cell-based reporter bioassays that can quantitatively measure the potencies of mAbs targeting TIGIT\/CD155, TIGIT\/CD112, CD112R\/CD112, and CD96\/CD155. Owing to the clinical combination of TIGIT blockade with PD-1\/PD-L1 blockade, we further developed a potency bioassay for bispecific antibodies simultaneously targeting TIGIT and PD-1\/PD-L1. These bioassays each consist of an engineered T effector cell line that expresses T cell receptors and IC receptors of interest, and an engineered artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPC) expressing the cor<br \/>responding ligands for the IC receptors. The T effector cell lines also express a luciferase reporter driven by a promoter specifically responding to TCR activation which can be inhibited by signaling from the IC receptors. Additionally, we developed bioassays that can measure potencies of agonist or antagonist mAbs targeting CD226. These bioassays are designed to reflect the mechanisms of action for the drug candidates designed for each IC receptor and the assay signals are specific. Most are prequalified according to ICH guidelines and show the precision, accuracy and linearity required for cGMP environments.

Our team recently identified shared immunogenic frameshift peptides in patient tumors that can be targets of T cell surveillance and preventative MSI-H cancer vaccines. We hypothesize that in Lynch Syndrome some premalignant lesions are capable of evading immune surveillance from cytotoxic T lymphocytes due to immune checkpoint expression and immunosuppression from tumor, myeloid and stromal cell populations. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) showed promising results in the treatment of MSI-H tumors and are being evaluated in the adjuvant setting of patients with Lynch syndrome post surgical resection. However, a significant percentage of advanced MSI-H tumors resist ICB suggesting evolving mechanisms of immune resistance. We will use a MSI-H in vivo mouse model and additionally develop 3D spheroids cocultured with immune cells to characterize the underlying immune resistance mechanisms. The MSI-H mouse model will first be applied to identify shared frameshifts in MSI-H tumors by WES to develop vaccination approaches preventing tumor growth. Then, we will quantify MSI-H tumor growth and immune infiltration in the MSI-H mouse model, with or without ICB. We will analyze the presence of immunosuppressive pathways and myeloid subsets in high growth resisting tumors by immunohistochemistry, scRNAseq, spatial transcriptomics and flow cytometry. In addition, we will perform short-term in vitro spheroid-splenic cell co-cultures to better characterize the early immune resistance mechanisms. We will also perform these spheroid-immune cell co-cultures using the immune cells taken from mice after vaccination or ICB to identify the early myeloid immune resistance mechanisms. Overall, the identification of shared immune frameshifts in MSI-H tumors will allow developing peptide vaccination approaches to prevent tumor growth. Further, the identification of myeloid resistance pathways will guide therapeutic strategies against tumor resisting to ICB and\/or vaccination.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-1,Mismatch repair deficiency,Immune checkpoint,Microsatellite instability,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Guillaume Mestrallet<\/b><sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"887f356b-ead7-415a-ba7e-ddf74835e52c","ControlNumber":"409","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>G.

The underlying mechanisms of non-responsiveness towards anti-PD-L1 treatment have been extensively studied and associated with many factors, including PD1\/PD-L1 expression level, tumor mutation burden, IFN signaling, loss of MHC-I, tumor microenvironment (immune infiltration, suppressive immune system), and so on.<br \/>Immunodeficient mice such as the NSG and NCG are commonly used to study the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies. These mice, reconstituted with either human PBMC or HSC, act as an avatar to provide a window of the potential agent efficacy at the preclinical level. However, due to the challenge of obtaining an HSC\/PBMC donor, and often cost and time can also be a limiting factor, many studies only use 2-5 human donors. Here we present data demonstrating the significant variation observed between donor-to-donor, highlighting the importance of testing multiple donors.<br \/>We reconstituted immune system and tumor tissue humanized mouse models using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and cell line-derived xenografts (CDX) in severe immunodeficiency NCG mice. Anti-tumor efficacy of anti-PD-L1 (Tecentriq) in huPBMC-NCG mice engrafted with several tumor cells including MDA-MB-231, HCC827, NUGC4, and some other CDX cell lines was tested in our system. In the cases of MDA-MB-231, HCC827, and NUGC4, different donors were enrolled in the same study, and tumor growth inhibition measured by tumor volume (TGI<sub>TV<\/sub>) of 3% to 52.40% (MDA-MB-231), 5% to 33% (HCC827) and 4.75% to 20.74% (NUGC4) were observed. Especially, In the case of MDA-MB-231, 6 donors were enrolled in this study at the same time. About 40% of immune infiltration was first observed in tumors. High expression of PD1 on immune cells and PDL1 on tumor cells were also detected from different donors simultaneously. Although the similar immune infiltration and PD1\/PDL1 expression, the TGI<sub>TV<\/sub> of 6 donors varied between 3% and 52.40%, suggesting the donor-dependent response to anti-PD-L1 treatment, which is similar to the clinical trials.<br \/>Our data showed diverse in vivo responses when multiple human PBMC donors were used for preclinical agent evaluation. While unsurprising, it showed the critical need to include various human PBMC donors when an agent is in preclinical status because the donors' immune profile may dictate the study's outcome. This can be divided into two parts, on the one hand, donor screening for favorable efficacy response donors in advance is an alternative approach to ensure the positive efficacy of anti-PDL1 blockade relative therapy. On the other hand, the low-efficacy response donors also can be candidates for anti-PD1\/PDL1 combination therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Tumor immunity,Immune system reconstitution,PDL1,PBMC-NCG mice,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Tingting Gu<sup>1<\/sup>, Weiwei Yu<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Hongyan Sun<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Fang Zhu<sup>1<\/sup>, Huiyi Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Mengting Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Shuai Li<sup>1<\/sup>, Jianming Xu<sup>1<\/sup>, Santi Suryani Chen<sup>2<\/sup>, Zhiying Li<sup>2<\/sup>, Mark Wade Moore<sup>2<\/sup>, Cunxiang Ju<sup>1<\/sup>, Hongyu Wang<sup>1<\/sup>, Jing Zhao<sup>1<\/sup>, Xiang Gao<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Gempharmatech Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China,<sup>2<\/sup>GemPharmatech LLC., La Jolla, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"215c9143-a56e-42ef-b73f-dfe1baf6ed8d","ControlNumber":"4189","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

In particular, the expression of PD-L1 could be an important factor in evaluating the possibility of immunotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer where targeted therapy is not possible and the prognosis is poor. Accordingly, this study investigated the effect of PD-L1 overexpression on the immune checkpoint inhibitor effect in triple-negative breast cancer.<br \/><b>Method:<\/b> The relationship between T stage and N stage according to PD-L1 mRNA expression was analyzed in the TCGA and METABRIC datasets of breast cancer. To evaluate the role of PD-L1, PD-L1-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines for <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> experiments were established.<br \/><b>Result:<\/b> Using TCGA and METABRIC datasets, we found that PD-L1 showed the highest expression in breast cancer of the basal subtype, but the correlation between T stage and N stage according to PD-L1 expression was not statistically significant. To determine the functional importance of PD-L1 in breast cancer, we established 4T1-PD-L1-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines. We observed that the overexpression of PD-L1 promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In the orthotopic tumor mouse model, PD-L1 showed no significant difference in tumor growth compared to the control group, but anti-PD-L1 treatment showed a significant antitumor effect.<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> We confirmed that overexpression of PD-L1 in an orthotopic breast cancer model did not induce increased tumor growth. Above all, it was confirmed that a high PD-L1 level enhances the antitumor effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Intratumoral heterogeneity was evaluated by IHC on representative sections of 59 surgically resected LUAD and 49 LUSC specimens.<br \/>Results: In LUAD scRNAseq, VTCN1 and HHLA2 were predominantly expressed on epithelial cells and were not co-expressed with PD-L1. However, IHC showed their expression in both tumor and immune cells. In TCGA analysis, there was a negative correlation between VTCN1 and PD-L1 (LUAD, r = -0.094, <i>p<\/i> = 0.033; LUSC, r = -0.227, <i>p<\/i> &#60;0.001). VTCN1 and HHLA2 showed positive correlations in both TCGA (LUAD, r = 0.211, <i>p<\/i> &#60;0.001; LUSC, r = 0.182, <i>p<\/i> &#60;0.001) and IHC analysis (LUAD, <i>p<\/i> &#60;0.001; LUSC, <i>p<\/i> = 0.016). They were more frequently expressed in <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant LUAD (52.9% vs. 40.3%, <i>p<\/i> = 0.015 for VTCN1 in <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant vs. wildtype; 59.8% vs. 40.5%, <i>p<\/i> &#60;0.001 for HHLA2). CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cell infiltration was significantly higher in VTCN1- or HHLA2-positive <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant LUAD, but there was no significant relationship in <i>EGFR<\/i>-wildtype. In 60% of cases expressing both VTCN1 and HHLA2, the two showed spatially concordant expression (15 out of 24 LUAD; 3 out of 6 LUSC). However, VTCN1 and PD-L1 showed concordant expression in 37.2% of cases expressing both (6 out of 16 LUAD; 10 out of 27 LUSC). HHLA2 expression was associated with better overall survival in LUSC, but there was no significant difference in survival according to VTCN1 expression.<br \/>Conclusions: VTCN1 and HHLA2 are frequently co-expressed in PD-L1-negative NSCLC, especially <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutant LUAD rich in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T-cells and can serve as potential novel immunotherapeutic targets.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,VTCN1,HHLA2,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Sojung Lim<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Jaemoon Koh<sup>1<\/sup>, Seung Geun Song<sup>1<\/sup>, Jeemin Yim<sup>1<\/sup>, Bogyeong Han<sup>1<\/sup>, Young A Kim<sup>2<\/sup>, Doo Hyun Chung<sup>1<\/sup>, Yoon Kyung Jeon<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Pathology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,<sup>2<\/sup>Pathology, Seoul Metropolitan Government Boramae Hospital, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"52b02d37-2831-4576-b55c-e5ecfec3b088","ControlNumber":"2355","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>S.

Study objectives are safety, dose-finding, and efficacy with focus on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and biomarker discovery. NTX1088 will be investigated as a single agent and combined with the anti-PD1 mAb, pembrolizumab (Keytruda) in patients with locally advanced and metastatic solid malignancies.NTX1088 is a humanized, IgG4-S228P mAb that binds PVR with sub-nM affinity and blocks all known interacting receptors with a single nM EC<sub>50<\/sub>. PVR, is a membranal protein, highly upregulated on tumor cells, across multiple cancer types. PVR expression has been associated with worse patient outcomes, due to its role in immune suppression. PVR&#8217;s impact on immune cells is mediated through interaction with the key stimulatory receptor, DNAM1 (CD226), on T and NK cells, leading to internalization and degradation of DNAM1. Additionally, PVR is the ligand for the inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors, TIGIT, CD96 and KIR2DL5A. Blocking PVR by NTX1088, therefore, has a multi-faceted immune-stimulating role, through restoration of DNAM1 expression and its immune activation function, while simultaneously neutralizing TIGIT, CD96 and KIR2DL5A inhibitory signals in immune cells. Importantly, DNAM1 downmodulation was recently identified as a key resistance mechanism to approved immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and its restoration by NTX1088 is a novel MoA, not demonstrated by other therapies.In vitro, as a monotherapy, NTX1088 significantly increased immune cell activation, and was superior to TIGIT, CD112R, and PD1 antibody blockade, leading to greater immune-mediated tumor cell killing, IFN&#947; secretion, and CD137 induction. Importantly, only NTX1088 was able to restore DNAM1 to the surface of immune cells in all experimental settings. Synergy was observed when NTX1088 was combined with PD1 blockers, or with the anti-CD112R mAb, NTX2R13, in line with the restoration of DNAM1 expression.Numerous humanized murine xenograft models were investigated. NTX1088 exhibited robust tumor growth inhibition as a standalone and in combination with PD1 blockade. Syngeneic models of PVR<sup>K.O <\/sup>resulted in complete immune-mediated tumor regression, including hard to treat colorectal tumors. In conclusion, PVR blockade by NTX1088 has a remarkable pre-clinical efficacy, suggesting a potential clinical breakthrough, based on the ability of simultaneously overcome multiple tumor escape mechanisms. First-in-human (FIH) trial is currently ongoing and biomarker data is analyzed to assess clinical impact of the drug and prepare for patient stratification.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Immune checkpoint,Immunotherapy,PD-1,Immuno-oncology,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Anas Atieh<sup>1<\/sup>, Akram Obiedat<sup>1<\/sup>, Alon Vitenshtein<sup>1<\/sup>, Guy Cinamon<sup>1<\/sup>, Keren Paz<sup>1<\/sup>, Tihana lenac<sup>2<\/sup>, Paola Kucan<sup>2<\/sup>, Marija Mazor<sup>2<\/sup>, Ofer Mandelboim<sup>3<\/sup>, Stipan Jonji<sup>2<\/sup>, <b>Pini Tsukerman<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Nectin Therapeutics, Ltd., Jerusalem, Israel,<sup>2<\/sup>MEDRI, Rijeka, Croatia,<sup>3<\/sup>HUJI, Jerusalem, Israel","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"1760808f-eb2e-46cc-b8b1-f5b07ec9694e","ControlNumber":"7278","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>A.

Since, the prevalence of PD-L1 expression and its prognostic role in MIUBC is unclear in China, we conducted a multi-center, prospective, epidemiological study to investigate prevalence of high PD-L1 expression and its correlation with other exploratory biomarkers including CD8+ T cells and tumor mutation burden (TMB) in Chinese MIUBC patients (NCT03433924). The study enrolled newly diagnosed, untreated MIUBC patients from 17 hospitals in China. High PD-L1 expression by Ventana PD-L1 [SP263] assay was defined as 1) &#8805;25% tumor cell (TC) + or 2) tumor associated immune cell (IC) area &#62;1%: &#8805;25% IC+; 3) IC area=1%: 100% IC+. The primary outcome was prevalence of high PD-L1 expression; secondary outcome was PD-L1 expression profile in TC or IC in patients. An exploratory study was conducted to investigate the percentage of patients with high infiltration of CD8+ T cells and elevated TMB using immunohistochemistry and next generation sequencing, respectively. High CD8+ and TMB status was considered if it refers to &#707; median value (3%) and &#707;10 mut\/Mb, respectively. Association of PD-L1 expression with demographic and baseline characteristics was evaluated by logistic regression model while PD-L1 with tumor biomarkers were evaluated by spearman&#8217;s rank correlation coefficient. Overall, 248 MIUBC patients were enrolled and 229 patients with PD-L1 data were included. High PD-L1 expression was observed in 52.4% patients. High PD-L1 expression was positive in 59 (25.8%) patients of TC and 82 (35.8%) patients of IC. CD8+ T cell and TMB showed high expression in 44.5% and 54.1% patients, respectively, with mean TMB of 14.14 mut\/Mb. The exploratory analysis showed no significant association of PD-L1 expression with age, gender, primary tumor site, metastatic disease, regional lymph node, tobacco use or AJCC stage. Further a weak and positive correlation was observed between percentage of TC with membrane PD-L1 positivity and CD8+ T cells (0.34, 95%Cl, 0.22 - 0.45, <i>p<\/i>&#706;0.001), IC with membrane PD-L1 positivity and CD8+ T cells (0.44, 95%Cl, 0.33 - 0.54, <i>p<\/i>&#706;0.001), TC with membrane PD-L1 positivity and TMB (0.05, 95%Cl, -0.08 - 0.19, <i>p<\/i>=0.441), IC with membrane PD-L1 positivity and TMB (0.16, 95%Cl, 0.02 - 0.29, <i>p<\/i>=0.020). In conclusion, our study showed high prevalence of PD-L1 expression in patients with MIUBC along with their weak, positive correlation with CD8+ T cells and TMB. These findings are consistent with other studies that show that PD-L1 and TMB stand as the most robust predictive biomarkers, but may be uncorrelated. With subsequent follow-up time, the effect of biomarkers on survival will be assessed in future study.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL07-03 Immune checkpoints,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-L1,Tumor mutational burden,Predictive biomarkers,Immune checkpoint blockade,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Yu Fan<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Tao Dai<sup>2<\/sup>, Dahong Zhang<sup>3<\/sup>, Hongqian Guo<sup>4<\/sup>, Fangjian Zhou<sup>5<\/sup>, Benkang Shi<sup>6<\/sup>, Shaogang Wang<sup>7<\/sup>, Zhigang Ji<sup>8<\/sup>, Chunxi Wang<sup>9<\/sup>, Xudong Yao<sup>10<\/sup>, Qiang Wei<sup>11<\/sup>, Nanhui Chen<sup>12<\/sup>, Jinchun Xing<sup>13<\/sup>, Jinjian Yang<sup>14<\/sup>, Chuize Kong<sup>15<\/sup>, Jian Huang<sup>16<\/sup>, Dingwei Ye<sup>17<\/sup>, Liqun Zhou<sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Department of Urology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Urology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University and Hunan Cancer Hospital, Changsha, China,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Urology, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou, China,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Urology, Drum Tower Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Institute of Urology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Urology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China,<sup>6<\/sup>Department of Urology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China,<sup>7<\/sup>Department of Urology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China,<sup>8<\/sup>Department of Urology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing, China,<sup>9<\/sup>Department of Urology, First Hospital of Jilin University, Jilin, China,<sup>10<\/sup>Department of Urology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China,<sup>11<\/sup>Department of Urology, Institute of Urology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Shanghai, China,<sup>12<\/sup>Department of Urology, Meizhou People's Hospital, Meizhou, China,<sup>13<\/sup>Department of Urology Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, China,<sup>14<\/sup>Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China,<sup>15<\/sup>Department of Urology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China,<sup>16<\/sup>Department of Urology, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China,<sup>17<\/sup>Department of Urology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"b84cc8ea-dbf5-4069-8eb4-f99a72f3ca2f","ControlNumber":"3395","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Y.
