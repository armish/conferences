[{"Abstract":"The proprietary XNA (xeno nucleic acid) technology has wide applications in sensitive detection of rare mutations in different genomic platforms. These target-specific DNA oligo analogs increase assay sensitivity by blocking the polymerase-dependent amplification of wildtype sequence so only amplification of the mutant sequence occurs. Here we show that the XNA technology helps enrich rare somatic mutations in different human specimen types such as FFPE and plasma samples, using technology platforms such as Sanger sequencing, TaqMan qPCR, and NGS. XNA increases assay sensitivity to 0.1% for Sanger sequencing and qPCR. For NGS, XNA allows detection of the mutant sequence at a lower sequencing depth, thus combining XNA technology with NGS for MRD (molecular residual disease) detection could improve cancer management. In addition, We also show CRISPR mutant screening using a target-specific XNA in a SYBR Green qPCR assay. XNA can be used for rapid CRISPR mutant screening for DNA from pool or individual clones generated from gene editing experiments. In summary, XNA technology is a powerful tool when combined with existing genomic mutation detection platforms to screen for rare somatic mutations and for rapid CRISPR mutant screening. The technology is customizable as a service for easy integration with current technology platforms and applications.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Diagnostic marker,cfDNA,Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR),Next-generation sequencing (NGS),"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Wei Liu<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Robert Brown<sup><\/sup>, Andrew Fu<sup><\/sup>, Shuo Shen<sup><\/sup>, Michael Sha<sup><\/sup>, Aiguo Zhang<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>DiaCarta, Pleasanton, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"572f0520-4106-449a-a60c-2003cc47c7d7","ControlNumber":"2277","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>W.

In this study, we prospectively evaluated the performance of Burning Rock Patient-specific pROgnostic and Potential tHErapeutic marker Tracking (brPROPHET), a patient-specific, tumor-informed MRD assay.<br \/>Methods: Surgical specimens and two serial blood biopsies (before and approximately 4 weeks after surgery) were collected. The brPROPHET MRD assay (Burning Rock Biotech, China) uses whole exome sequencing for detecting patient-specific somatic alterations from tumor tissues and for blood a personalized panel designed to target up to 50 variants. For head-to-head comparison, the samples were also subjected to a tumor-informed, fixed-panel assay using 520- and 168-gene panels respectively for tumor and blood samples.<br \/>Results: A total of 17 patients were analyzed. Most were men (11, 64.7%), had extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (13, 76.5%), or stage II disease (15, 88.2%). Median age was 64 years (range 57-68). Disease-free survival (DFS) was available for 14 patients at a median follow-up of 11.5 months (range 6.5-16.0). Baseline and postoperative ctDNA positivity rates were 64.7% (11\/17) and 11.8% (2\/17) with brPROPHET and 17.7% (3\/17) and 5.8% (1\/17) with the fixed-panel assay using 520- and 168-gene panels. Moreover, of the 3 patients who have relapsed, 1 was postoperatively ctDNA-positive by both assays and 1 only by brPROPHET. These findings suggested superior technical sensitivity of patient-specific over fixed-panel approach in detecting tumor-associated aberrations, and this advantage could translate into more sensitive identification of surgical BTC patients at high risk of recurrence. Furthermore, ctDNA positivity determined brPROPHET by was significantly associated with shorter DFS (log-rank p = 0.003), while that by fixed-panel was not (log-rank p = 0.113), suggesting a stronger association between the patient-specific approach with clinical outcomes. brPROPHET-derived postoperative ctDNA positivity also showed higher negative predictive value (91.7% vs 84.6%) and accuracy (92.9% vs 85.7%) in predicting recurrence. Together, these results supported a better performance of brPROPHET than the fixed panel approach for MRD detection.<br \/>Conclusions: This prospective study demonstrated the clinical performance of brPROPHET, a patient-specific tumor-informed ctDNA-based MRD test for surgical patients with BTC. Compared with the fixed-panel approach using 520- and 168-gene panels respectively for tumor and blood samples, brPROPHET yields higher sensitivity, accuracy, and negative predictive value in predicting relapse.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),Gastrointestinal cancers: other,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Tianqiang Song<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Qiang Wu<sup><\/sup>, Yunlong Cui<sup><\/sup>, Huikai Li<sup><\/sup>, Wei Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Feng Fang<sup><\/sup>, Qingqing Xiong<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"edc68c9e-a07b-4b12-93c3-27d67cbca87d","ControlNumber":"3305","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>T.

CtDNA were analyzed by next-generation-sequencing (NGS) panel of 118 genes and the varient allele frequency (VAF) of detected genes were analyzed. Then the association between outcomes of 5FU treated response and survival (overall survival and progression-free survival; OS and PFS) and VAF reduction at follow-up were analyzed.<br \/>Results: Total of 35 genes with 114 genetic alterations were detected and frequent mutations were as follows: KRAS (29.9%), TP53 (14.9%), GNAS(4.4%), SMAD4(4.4%), AR(3.5%), RNF434(3.5%), ATM(3.5%), BRCA2(2.6%) and PIK3CA(2.6%).

Large number of clinical trials are in progress to gauge efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors or immune checkpoint inhibitors against actionable targets such as receptor tyrosine kinases and program death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Although highly effective, the outcome of PD-L1 based ICI or TKI against RTKs is vitally contingent on the presence of PD-L1 or RTK expression on circulating tumor cells. We report validation of CTCs with PD-L1, HER2 and EGFR expression in different epithelial cancers.<br \/>Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 134 carcinoma patients blood for presence of CTCs expressing PD-L1, HER2 or EGFR markers respect. 45 % patients had lung cancer, while 25 % and 20 % were presented with breast and GI and CRC malignancies. Remaining were gallbladder, ovarian, prostate, and head and neck cancers. CTCs were isolated from DCGI approved OncoDiscover platform with immunomagnetic targeting of EpCAM. CTCs were confirmed with expression of CK18, absence of CD45 and presence of DAPI nucleus. Presence\/absence of biomarkers was determined using fluorescence imaging. Expression of PD-L1, HER2 or EGFR was detected by fluorescence microscopy using fluorescently labelled anti PD-L1, HER2 or EGFR antibodies respect. Based on fluorescence intensity CTCs were binned as PD-L1, HER2 or EGFR negative for no detectable fluorescence signal or weakly or strongly positive based on low or high fluorescence signal.<br \/>Results: Among the evaluated cohort, 51% of CTCs showed presence of PD-L1 expression. While 63% showed HER2 positive CTCs (breast cancer). 20% from the PD-L1 positive population showed stronger PD-L1 expression. 78% of CTCs from lung cancer patients showed presence of detectable PD-L1 signal, while 66% breast, GI and CRC patients showed CTCs with PD-L1 expression. CTCs from HNC and gall bladder cancer patients showed low PD-L1 expression (25% and 50% respect.). Among CTCs originating from different cancer types, breast cancer CTCs showed higher mean expression of PD-L1 compared to CTCs from CRC patients. A clear subset of CTCs for PD-L1 and Her2 expression was observed in lung and breast cancer patients respect, suggesting the heterogeneity in expression or presence of different subclones within the same tumor type. CTCs evaluated for EGFR expression, 50% showed presence of detectable EGFR compared to the cut-off signal.<br \/>Conclusions: CTC can be used as a real-time surrogate for molecular profiling of PD-L1, HER2 and EGFR expression. These CTC cell surface markers offer alternative for immunotherapy or targeted therapies decisions in a adenocarcinomas.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"PD-L1,,,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Jayant Khandare<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Atul Bharde<sup>1<\/sup>, Sreeja Jayant<sup>1<\/sup>, Gourishankar Aland<sup>1<\/sup>, Meghana Garbhe<sup>1<\/sup>, Sayali Gosavi<sup>1<\/sup>, Apoorva Janorkar<sup>1<\/sup>, Purva Tikekar<sup>1<\/sup>, Mrunmayi Patil<sup>1<\/sup>, Vikas Jadhav<sup>1<\/sup>, Ganesh Khutale<sup>1<\/sup>, Amrut Ashturkar<sup>1<\/sup>, Aravindan Vasudevan<sup>1<\/sup>, Kumar Prabhash<sup>2<\/sup>, Nirmal Raut<sup>3<\/sup>, Pankaj Chaturvedi<sup>4<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Actorius Innovation and Research USA and India, Pune, India,<sup>2<\/sup>Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India,<sup>3<\/sup>Bhaktivedanta Hospital And Research Institute, Mumbai, India,<sup>4<\/sup>Tata Memorial Hospital, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"cd65a2b0-6908-474a-a17f-2a854bb4f223","ControlNumber":"7048","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Here we present liquid biopsy mutational profiles and genome-wide cell-free DNA (cfDNA) copy-number burden levels for historical cancer cohorts analyzed with PredicineCARE. We include a total of 3,147 samples from six major cancer indications: prostate (n=1681), lung (n=630), breast (n=300), colorectal (n=217), pancreatic (n=190), and bladder (n=129).<br \/><b>Methods. <\/b>PredicineCARE employs a 152 targeted gene panel covering all major guideline-recommended alterations for patient care and clinical drug development including targeted therapies and immunotherapies. The assay detects single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions and deletions, gene-level copy number loss\/gain, and targeted re-arrangements\/fusions. Concurrent low-pass whole-genome sequencing (without the need for additional sample volume) is performed to measure blood-based genome-wide copy-number burden (bCNB) and tumor fraction, providing important complementary molecular insights to variant detection.<br \/><b>Results. <\/b>We present data from a representative cohort of blood and urine samples processed at Predicine lab in Hayward California (n=3,147). Sequencing was performed using a minimum of 5 ng total cfDNA input from 1-5 mL of plasma or 20-40mL of urine, at one or more clinical timepoints per patient. Samples were sequenced at ~20,000X target panel coverage and the majority also had ~2.5X low-pass whole genome sequencing. Using the Predicine in-house DeepSea bioinformatics pipeline, we report variants as low as 0.05% allele frequency and estimate genome-wide CNVs and bCNB from low-pass data. We compare the mutational and CNV profiles of important genes in each liquid biopsy cancer cohort to variants reported in solid tumor tissues from several large public data sets including Project GENIE (n=71,817 patients) and 136 additional study programs including TCGA (n=38,619 patients, www.cBioPortal.org).<br \/><b>Conclusion. <\/b>PredicineCARE is a highly sensitive and robust assay for detecting cancer variants in blood and urine. The cfDNA mutation profiles are mostly consistent with public tissue datasets. A small but significant portion of the detected ctDNA variants have been shown to be important for treatment selection or are currently being tested for targeted drug development. Increased bCNB provides a useful measure to monitor treatment response and disease progression. PredicineCARE has been CE-marked and received breakthrough device designation from FDA. A harmonized PredicineCARE assay is available in the US and China to support patient testing in the clinic, global clinical trials and CDx development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,cfDNA,Copy number variation,Mutation detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Billie Gould<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Lu Tan<sup><\/sup>, Chao Dai<sup><\/sup>, Tiantian Zheng<sup><\/sup>, Wei Mo<sup><\/sup>, Xianghong Wang<sup><\/sup>, Michael Sneddon<sup><\/sup>, Shidong Jia<sup><\/sup>, Kemin Zhou<sup><\/sup>, Pan Du<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>Predicine Inc., Hayward, CA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"0ce2a16e-9c46-41b3-9a8b-2f3aaf4a86c2","ControlNumber":"6907","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;B.

We sought to determine the diagnostic ability of miR-665 as a serum biomarker for PBca, and to explore the role of miR-665 in PC.<br \/>Methods: This multicenter study enrolled patients with treatment-na&#239;ve PBca and healthy participants. PBca-related serum miRNAs were determined using weighted co-expression network analysis of a comprehensive serum miRNA microarray dataset in an exploratory cohort. Using various combinations of PBca-related serum miRNAs, Fisher&#8217;s linear discriminant analyses provided miRNA signatures to discriminate PBca from healthy controls. MiRNA signatures with a sensitivity\/specificity (SN\/SP) of &#8805;80\/80% and high AUC in comparison with the AUC of CA19-9 were defined as the diagnostic miRNA signature in exploratory, validation and independent validation cohorts, whose accuracy was confirmed by 5-fold cross validation. Biology of the diagnostic miRNAs was evaluated using biopsy samples from liver metastasis of PC patients and human PC cells.<br \/>Results: We analyzed 496 of 1487 enrolled subjects (150 healthy and 134 PBca, 50 healthy and 47 PBca, and 50 healthy and 46 PBca subjects in the exploratory, validation and independent validation cohorts, respectively). Among miRNA signatures from 82 PBca-related miRNAs, a five serum miRNA combination containing miR-665 was identified as the diagnostic miRNA signature in all three cohorts. SN\/SP and AUC in the validation and independent validation cohorts were 92\/88% and 0.95 (CA19-9: 81\/92% and 0.94) and 87\/80% and 0.91 (CA19-9: 80\/98% and 0.87), respectively. In sub-population analysis for detecting 48 resectable PCs, the discriminative ability of the diagnostic miRNA signature plus CA19-9 (SN\/SP: 90\/78%) was superior in sensitivity to that of CA19-9 alone (60\/94%). In seven PC patients with liver metastasis, high expression of intratumor miR-665 tended to correlate with high serum miR-665 level (r = 0.56) and low expression of intratumor phospho-Erk expression (r = 0.57). Transfection of miR-665 to a human PC cell led to cell growth suppression.<br \/>Conclusions: This study identified the diagnostic ability of a tumor suppressor miR-665-based serum miRNA signature for PBca. For detecting resectable PC, a miR-665-based serum miRNA signature plus CA19-9 is a superior biomarker to CA19-9 alone.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,MicroRNA,Pancreatic cancer,Biliary tract cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Shuichi Mitsunaga<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Makoto Ueno<sup>2<\/sup>, Masahiro Tsuda<sup>3<\/sup>, Takamichi Kuwahara<sup>4<\/sup>, Yukiko Takayama<sup>5<\/sup>, Keiji Hanada<sup>6<\/sup>, Hitoshi Yoshida<sup>7<\/sup>, Kenji Takahashi<sup>8<\/sup>, Kohei Nakata<sup>9<\/sup>, Hideaki Iwama<sup>10<\/sup>, Masafumi Ikeda<sup>11<\/sup>, Satoshi Kobayashi<sup>2<\/sup>, Ikuya Miki<sup>3<\/sup>, Kazuo Hara<sup>4<\/sup>, Ryota Higuchi<sup>12<\/sup>, Akinori Shimizu<sup>6<\/sup>, Tomohiro Nomoto<sup>7<\/sup>, Hidetaka Iwamoto<sup>8<\/sup>, Masafumi Nakamura<sup>9<\/sup>, Etsuro Hatano<sup>10<\/sup>, Hiroko Sudo<sup>13<\/sup>, Satoko Takizawa<sup>13<\/sup>, Atsushi Ochiai<sup>14<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Division of Biomarker Research, Exploratory Oncology Research and Clinical Trial Center, National Cancer Center, Kashiwa, Japan,<sup>2<\/sup>Department of Gastroenterology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan,<sup>3<\/sup>Department of Gastroenterological Oncology, Hyogo Cancer Center, Akashi, Japan,<sup>4<\/sup>Department of Gastroenterology, Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya, Japan,<sup>5<\/sup>Department of Gastroenterology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>6<\/sup>Department of Gastroenterology, Onomichi General Hospital, Onomichi, Japan,<sup>7<\/sup>Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, Showa University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>8<\/sup>Department of Medicine, Asahikawa Medical University, Asahikawa, Japan,<sup>9<\/sup>Department of Surgery and Oncology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan,<sup>10<\/sup>Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya, Japan,<sup>11<\/sup>Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital East, Kashiwa, Japan,<sup>12<\/sup>Department of Surgery, Institute of Gastroenterology, Tokyo Women’s Medical University, Tokyo, Japan,<sup>13<\/sup>Toray Industries, Inc., Kamakura, Japan,<sup>14<\/sup>Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Japan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"f4784aea-34df-442a-a7f7-41052aef329c","ControlNumber":"1450","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;S.

Liquid biopsies have become critical in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) given the patient risks associated with biopsies. It is well established that circulating nucleic acid levels representative of all solid tumors are increased in advanced stages of the disease. Less well characterized is the status of cfDNA levels in the earliest stages of solid tumor progression. We used validated methods for quantitative fluorometry and a high sensitivity amplicon based NGS method to survey cfDNA recovery and prevalence for the four major mutation classes (copy number amplifications (CNAs), single nucleotide variations (SNVs), fusions, and insertions\/deletions (INDELs)) from patients previously diagnosed with NSCLC.<br \/><b>Methods<\/b>: Cell-free nucleic acid was extracted from 1,139 late-stage and 185 early-stage NSCLC plasma specimens. cfDNA was quantified using fluorometry, and the 52 gene GeneStrat NGS Test was used for the detection of CNAs, SNVs, fusions and INDELs. We evaluated cfDNA concentration (normalized to plasma input volume), quantity in circulation, and the prevalence of the four classes of mutations in early-stage (I-IIIA) versus late-stage (IIIB-IV) NSCLC.<br \/><b>Results: <\/b>We observed significantly lower average concentrations of cf nucleic acids in plasma recovered from early versus late-stage NSCLC specimens (early-stage: 13.7 ng\/mL; range (3.14, 118.65); n = 185; late-stage: 18.3 ng\/mL; range (0.67, 187.2); n =1,139; p=0.00176). We also evaluated total cfDNA recovered for the sample set and observed significantly lower average measurements for early-stage specimens versus late-stage (early-stage: 101.4 ng; range (18.38, 652.6); n=185; late-stage: 140.5 ng; range (9.802, 1534); n=1,139; p=0.00692). We do note that there were overlaps at the low end of the ranges. Also significant was the finding that all mutation classes were more prevalent in late versus early-stage NSCLC. Specifically, 56 of 58 CNAs (96.6%); 737 of 805 SNVs (91.6%); 42 of 43 INDELs (97.3%) and 12 fusions (100%) were associated with late-stage specimens.<br \/><b>Conclusion<\/b>: In this observational study cohort, cfDNA yields were significantly higher in late-stage NSCLC patients compared to early-stage. We also observed significantly more and varied mutations in plasma from late-stage patients. These initial findings need to be extended to additional cancers and refined by stage at diagnosis. We are currently expanding our study to include additional technologies and panels to assess ctDNA mutations especially for the early-stage patients. Quantitative cfDNA data may be of utility in diagnosis, monitoring and recurrence of cancer.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,Early detection,NSCLC,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Claire Gould<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Leisa Jackson<sup><\/sup>, Colin Cochran<sup><\/sup>, Audrey Audetat<sup><\/sup>, Brittany D'Alessio<sup><\/sup>, Amanda Weaver<sup><\/sup>, Janice Riley<sup><\/sup>, Gary A.

Molecular screening approaches for HPV detection are gaining promising data over cytologic analysis. Similarly, liquid biopsy-based approaches are becoming a powerful tool for cancer detection and monitoring.<br \/>Materials and Methods: An HPV panel detecting 24 HPV types was developed suitable for liquid biopsy approaches. Here, HPV measurement was performed with an iPLEX multiplex PCR-based workflow combined with mass spectrometry-based analysis (MassARRAY System, Agena Bioscience). The assay was validated on HPV positive plasmid controls and cell lines. Furthermore, 52 cervical smear samples from HSIL positive women and 40 cfDNA samples (peripheral blood) from cervical cancer patients were screened using this approach.<br \/>Results: According to already published ring trial results, the HPV types HPV6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 58 and 59 were considered proficient with the required detection level of 50 and 5 international units (IU)\/5 &#181;l for HPV 16 and 18, and 500 and 50 HPV genome equivalents (GE)\/5&#181;l for the other HPV types (Arroyo M&#252;hr et al., 2022). Further analyses showed a sensitivity of 0.03% for HPV16 and 0.33% HPV18 and 0.33% for the other tested HPV types. HPV DNA was detected in 94% of (49\/52) smear samples analyzed. 86.5% were found positive for at least one of the high-risk HPV (hrHPV) types in the study cohort. Two of the three HPV negative samples were truly negative according to clinical data. In 15 samples, multiple HPV types were found, with positivity in up to five different HPV types. For smear samples a sensitivity of 98.14% and a positive predictive value of 0.98 (49\/50) were thus obtained. The overall agreement between the MassARRAY and Seegene (from clinical records) HPV tests was 97.2% (&#954;=0.84). 27 of 40 (67.5%) cfDNA cervical cancer samples were tested positive for any HPV type. The distribution of HPV types showed most infections being due to hrHPV (25\/27 plasma HPV positive). HPV positive samples were found in all FIGO stages, with 56.5% positivity in FIGO stage I and 87.5% in FIGO stage III and IV.<br \/>Conclusions: The HPV assay showed reliable results for detecting a large number of HPV types in a multiplex mass spectrometry-based assay. A high sensitivity was achieved for both, cervical smear samples of HSIL patients as well as cfDNA from blood samples of cervical cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Cervical cancer,Liquid biopsies,Human papillomavirus (HPV),Cell-free DNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Johanna Herbst<sup>1<\/sup>, Vanessa Vohl<sup>1<\/sup>, Maroje Krajina<sup>2<\/sup>, Katharina Prieske<sup>3<\/sup>, Anna Jaeger<sup>3<\/sup>, Markus Leffers<sup>1<\/sup>, Leticia Oliveira-Ferrer<sup>3<\/sup>, Yvonne Goy<sup>4<\/sup>, Klaus Pantel<sup>1<\/sup>, Alexander Sartori<sup>2<\/sup>, Caren Vollmert<sup>2<\/sup>, Linn Wölber<sup>3<\/sup>, Katharina Effenberger<sup>1<\/sup>, <b>Harriet Wikman<\/b><sup>1<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>Tumor Biology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany,<sup>2<\/sup>Agena Bioscience GmbH, Hamburg, Germany,<sup>3<\/sup>Gynecology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany,<sup>4<\/sup>Radiology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"72204948-3958-4086-ae5e-55da0cb066e4","ControlNumber":"2884","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>J.

Surgery is the best option for early lung cancer, and the role of adjuvant therapy remains controversial. Liquid biopsy offers a noninvasive approach to monitor cancer burden. Targeted sequencing of circulating cell free tumor DNA (ctDNA) in blood has shown success for diagnosis; however, low tumor burden and dynamic evolution of low stage disease is challenging for targeted panels. Thus, we hypothesized that a whole genome sequencing (WGS)-derived patient specific mutational signature from a matched tumor-normal WGS can provide sensitive and specific approach to detect mutations and copy numbers in ctDNA for monitoring of lung adenocarcinoma patients.<br \/>Methods: We successfully profiled 50 Stage 1 or 2 lung adenocarcinomas. ctDNA was extracted from 1-2 mL of plasma, tumor DNA was extracted from pathology tissue and normal germline DNA from the white blood cells. WGS using was performed on matched tumor and normal DNA, and ctDNA extracted from plasma. WGS coverage was 40x for matched tumor-normal and 20x for ctDNA. We derived a personalized mutational pattern for each tumor and used an AI-based error suppression model for quantification and ultra-sensitive detection of ctDNA in plasma samples. A patient-specific personalized genome-wide compendium of somatic mutations and copy numbers was established and ctDNA tested at 3 to 18 available time points during the therapy or follow up. A personalized mutational signature for detection ctDNA from WGS was quantified and the ctDNA Tumor Fraction (TF) was compared to the clinical status and time to recurrence.<br \/>Results: Tumor specific signatures were derived from matched tumor-normal samples with &#62;5% tumor purity and &#60;30% duplications rate. Out of all patients, 33 patients showed no recurrence and 12 recurred. Tumor-specific signatures detected the presence of the tumor signature in plasma with TF as low as 10<sup>-5<\/sup>. Based on positive minimal residual disease in plasma, the recurrence prediction sensitivity was 0.75 and specificity 0.82, with positive predictive value of 0.6 and negative predictive value 0.9. WGS ctDNA predicted recurrence with a median lead time of 508 days before clinical\/imaging recurrence. In one case we were able to identify the second primary by deconvoluting known and novel ctDNA mutations. ctDNA mutational profiles enabled identification of smoking mutational signature matching clinical history, and APOBEC and ageing signatures as well as tumor mutational burden.<br \/>Conclusions: Patient-specific WGS tumor signature from plasma derived ctDNA enables specific and ultrasensitive tracking of minimal residual disease in low stage lung adenocarcinoma patients. Molecularly positive status can be used to predict recurrence and identify patients with clinical low stage disease that may benefit from adjuvant therapy.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,Molecular profiling,Liquid biopsies,Lung cancer: non-small cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Ivy Tran<sup>1<\/sup>, Alejandro Vargas<sup>1<\/sup>, Reid Wilkins<sup>1<\/sup>, Isabella Pizzillo<sup>1<\/sup>, Kenneth Tokoro<sup>2<\/sup>, Danielle Afterman<sup>3<\/sup>, Tomer Lauterman<sup>3<\/sup>, Maja Kuzman<sup>4<\/sup>, Santiago Gonzalez<sup>4<\/sup>, Dunja Glavas<sup>4<\/sup>, James Smadbeck<sup>4<\/sup>, Dillon Maloney<sup>4<\/sup>, Jurica Levatic<sup>4<\/sup>, Samuel Phillips<sup>4<\/sup>, Sunil Deochand<sup>4<\/sup>, Michael Yahalom<sup>4<\/sup>, Ryan Ptashkin<sup>4<\/sup>, Iman Tavassoly<sup>4<\/sup>, Zohar Donenhirsh<sup>3<\/sup>, Eric White<sup>4<\/sup>, Ravi Kandasamy<sup>4<\/sup>, Ury Alon<sup>3<\/sup>, Paz Polak<sup>4<\/sup>, Boris Oklander<sup>3<\/sup>, Asaf Zviran<sup>4<\/sup>, <b>Matija Snuderl<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Harvey  I.

We sought to validate an ultra-deep plasma Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) assay for patients with Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancers (NSCLC) for detecting Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) following curative-intent NSCLC treatment or EGFR detection at an early stage.<br \/>Patients and Methods: We carried out targeted NGS using the Plasma-SeqSensei&#8482; Solid Cancer IVD Kit on cfDNA extracted from plasma. Somatic alterations were filtered, removing somatic mutations attributable to clonal hematopoiesis. Sensitivity and specificity for plasma detection of known oncogenic drivers were calculated. In a subset of cases, validation was carried out using an orthogonal OncoBEAM<sup>TM<\/sup> EGFR V2 assay, as well as with a custom-validated NGS assay.<br \/>Results: In comparison with the OncoBEAM<sup>TM<\/sup> EGFR V2 kit, we observed a 75% concordance with the Plasma-SeqSensei&#8482; Solid Cancer IVD Kit. The 25% genomic discordances were respectively observed in 5%, 7% and 13% linked to the limit of coverage of the OncoBEAM<sup>TM<\/sup> EGFR V2 kit, the limit of EGFR sensitivity of the Plasma-SeqSensei&#8482; Solid Cancer IVD Kit and the larger <i>KRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF<\/i> coverage of the Plasma-SeqSensei&#8482; Solid Cancer IVD Kit.

The 32% genomic discordances were respectively observed in 5%, 11% and 16% linked to the limit of coverage of the Plasma-SeqSensei&#8482; Solid Cancer IVD Kit, the limit of covered sensitivity of the custom-validated NGS assay and the additional oncodrivers analysis only covered by the custom-validated NGS assay. Benefitting from the higher coverage from targetable <i>BRAF, KRAS, PIK3CA <\/i>targetable alterations, the plasma targeted NGS Plasma-SeqSensei&#8482; Solid Cancer IVD Kit showed 13% additional discordances with the Plasma OncoBEAM<sup>TM<\/sup> EGFR V2 kit.

In Tumor-Informed (TI) strategies, mutations from the tumor are used to define a set of patient-specific markers that are tracked in the blood as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Whereas tumor-na&#239;ve (TN) approaches do not require prior genomic information from the tumor and instead employ a fixed panel of marker(s). Methylated DNA Markers (MDMs) can be used to distinguish cancer from non-cancer and can be found in plasma. We have developed a proprietary TN MRD platform for colorectal cancer (CRC) capable of measuring as few as 1-5 strands of MDM target. Additionally, we are actively developing a TI MRD assay platform. Here we describe the evaluation of both TI and TN approaches for the detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in blood across all stages of colorectal cancer and explore the complementarity of these two approaches in the context of MRD monitoring. Procedures: A 20-sample cohort of paired tumor\/normal and pre-surgery plasma specimens from stage I (6\/20), stage II (7\/20), stage III (6\/20), and stage IV (1\/20) CRC patients and 20 demographically matched non-cancer controls were acquired for our study. All cancer plasma samples were collected prior to tumor resection. Neat and diluted plasma samples were tested for the presence of ctDNA containing short variants specifically derived from the corresponding primary tumor and for a pre-defined set of MDMs and protein cancer biomarkers. Tumor-specific short variants were characterized by whole exome sequencing of the primary tumors. MDMs were detected from bisulfite converted cfDNA by Target Enrichment Long probe Quantitative Amplified Signal (TELQAS) for 35 MDMs. A cancer detection classifier for the TN assay was trained and validated using a separate cohort of non-cancer and CRC plasma samples and employed for this study. Protein was detected by high throughput ELISA.Results: Tumor sequencing of the 20 CRC samples identified between 122 and 7146 (median = 230) somatic mutations per tumor sample. The combination of features from TI and TN assays achieved 95% accuracy, demonstrating an improvement over either assay in isolation. Indeed, 5 &#8220;positive&#8221; calls were made for cancer samples for which only one of the two methods met pre-defined RUO thresholds for ctDNA detection. Comparison of median variant allele fraction from the TI assay with median percent methylation of CRC markers for these CRC samples had a Pearson&#8217;s correlation of 0.967. Conclusion: TI and TN assays show high concordance in cancer detection, but also complement each other. Additionally, ctDNA quantifications produced from TI and TN assays are linearly correlated. The combination of data from both assays can be used to further differentiate cancer samples from non-cancer samples.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Diagnostic marker,Methylation,Mutation detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"Alanna Chan<sup><\/sup>, Martin You<sup><\/sup>, Oliver Limbo<sup><\/sup>, Billyana Tsevtanova<sup><\/sup>, Gerald Dodson<sup><\/sup>, Brenda Curiel<sup><\/sup>, Karma Farhat<sup><\/sup>, Samantha Scott<sup><\/sup>, Archana Ramesh<sup><\/sup>, Jacquelyn Hennek<sup><\/sup>, Viacheslav Katerov<sup><\/sup>, Michael Kaiser<sup><\/sup>, Hatim Allawi<sup><\/sup>, <b>Brady  P.

This systematic review summarizes current data on the utility of ctDNA in breast cancer clinical research and practice and provides insights for integrating ctDNA into drug development and patient treatment.<br \/>Methods: The Embase database was used to identify original clinical research articles of ctDNA in breast cancer published from 2015 to 2020. ctDNA clinical utilities were reviewed and summarized, focusing on 3 areas: early diagnosis, prognostication, and monitoring disease progression\/treatment response. Associations of ctDNA with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated in the embedded meta-analysis. Pooled estimates were calculated using fixed-effect or random-effect models depending on study heterogeneity.<br \/>Results: After screening and review, 72 articles were included. ctDNA studies have increased in recent years, with 59.7% of included articles published in 2019 or 2020. Overall, 61.1% of the studies were in patients with advanced stage\/metastatic cancer; 45.8% were restricted to patients with specific cancer subtypes. ctDNA was minimally used in diagnosis; it was predominantly used in clinical outcome prediction with differences by stage. In patients with early-stage disease, the meta-analyses found that overall ctDNA detection\/positivity was associated with shorter DFS (n=697; HR, 5.37; 95% CI, 2.94-9.80) and OS (n=238; HR, 4.60; 95% CI, 2.56-8.26). Specific gene mutations in ctDNA were mainly assessed in patients with advanced\/metastatic disease, with mutations of <i>ERBB<\/i>, <i>ESR1<\/i>, and <i>TP53<\/i> linked to shorter DFS in the meta-analyses (<i>P<\/i>&#60;0.05). Moreover, current studies provided evidence that ctDNA reflects the dynamics of breast tumors in the patient treatment journey, acting as a biomarker to monitor tumor evolution and drug resistance.<br \/>Conclusions: Recent studies demonstrate ctDNA application in breast cancer prognostication\/monitoring, suggesting an important role in patient stratification, molecular relapse identification, and personalized treatment. Large, multicenter clinical trials and real-world longitudinal data sets are needed to validate findings and to address challenges related to ctDNA to improve clinical utility and to integrate ctDNA testing into clinical practice and drug development.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Breast cancer,Liquid biopsies,Circulating tumor DNA,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Xuezheng Sun<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Nicholas Ballew<sup>2<\/sup>, Linda Kalilani<sup>1<\/sup>, Kelesitse Phiri<sup>3<\/sup>, Kelly Bell<sup>2<\/sup>, Alexander Slowly<sup>4<\/sup>, Magdalena Zajac<sup>4<\/sup>, Erin Hofstatter<sup>5<\/sup>, Angela Silvestro<sup>5<\/sup>, Zebin Wang<sup>6<\/sup>, Jeanne Schilder<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>GSK, Research Triangle Park, NC,<sup>2<\/sup>GSK, Philadelphia, PA,<sup>3<\/sup>GSK, Collegeville, PA,<sup>4<\/sup>GSK, London, United Kingdom,<sup>5<\/sup>GSK, Waltham, MA,<sup>6<\/sup>GSK (at the time the analysis was conducted), Waltham, MA","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"6a3469a1-eb25-427d-96b7-92c587a72f64","ControlNumber":"328","DisclosureBlock":"<b>&nbsp;X.

In this study, we evaluated tumor genomic differences in patients with EOCRC versus late-onset CRC (LOCRC, age &#62;60).<br \/>Methods: The international cohort included 13,262 patients diagnosed with stages I-III colon or rectal cancer who had ctDNA testing using a personalized and tumor-informed multiplex PCR assay (Signatera&#8482; 16-plex bespoke mPCR NGS assay), from which whole-exome sequencing (WES) on the surgically resected tumor was performed. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) status were derived from WES analysis. The prevalence of gene-wide mutations, pathogenic gene variants, and mutations in known oncogenic pathways was compared between EOCRC and LOCRC groups, stratified by TMB and MSI status. Fisher&#8217;s exact test was used to test significance between the groups and p-values were adjusted using the FDR method for multiple test correction.<br \/>Results: A total of 3,093 patients with EOCRC (70.8% colon, 27.4% rectal, 1.9% unknown) and 10,169 patients with LOCRC (79.9% colon, 18.3% rectal, 1.7% unknown) were included, where 9.0%\/37.3%\/53.7% were AJCC stages I, II, and III, respectively. Early-onset patients compared to late-onset patients had fewer cases of stage II CRC (30.7% vs. 39.3%, p&#60;0.01) and more cases of stage III CRC (60.9% vs 51.6%, p&#60;0.01). Adjusted by stage, patients with EOCRC were less likely to be MSI-H compared to patients with LOCRC (10% vs. 17%, p&#60;0.01), or have high tumor mutational burden (TMB-H) (15% vs. 19%, p&#60;0.01). Genes of the Hippo, NOTCH, WNT, and RTK-RAS oncogenic pathways were less commonly mutated in the EOCRC cohort (p&#60;0.01). The BRAF V600E mutation was less prevalent in the EOCRC group (3% vs. 15%, p&#60;0.01), regardless of TMB and MSI status. In the TMB-low\/MSS group, TP53 mutations were more common in EOCRC (8% vs. 5%, p&#60;0.01), but APC gene mutations were less common in EOCRC (56% vs. 66%, p&#60;0.01). When comparing EOCRC and LOCRC in the TMB-H\/MSI-H group, BRAF V600E (4% vs. 60%), RNF43 G659V (16% vs. 45%), and WNT1 G619A (6% vs. 20%) mutations were less prevalent in EOCRC (p&#60;0.01 for all mutations); however, patients with EOCRC had more mutations in PIK3CA H1047R (22% vs. 9%), APC R1468* (11% vs. 3%), and KRAS A146T (7% vs. 2%) gene variants (p&#60;0.01 for all mutations). In the TMB-H\/MSS group, EOCRC patients were more likely to have driver mutations in the PI3K pathway (74% vs. 56%, p&#60;0.01). Further, POLE P286R mutations were more common in TMB-H\/MSS patients with EOCRC compared to LOCRC (38% vs. 13%, p&#60;0.01), whereas ACVR2A K437R was less common (11% vs. 30%, p&#60;0.01).<br \/>Conclusion: Patients with LOCRC were more likely to have pathogenic gene variants and mutations in established pathways of CRC carcinogenesis. Tumors in EOCRC cases harbored unique genomic alterations that varied between the TMB-low\/MSS, TMB-H\/MSI-H, and TMB-H\/MSS subpopulations.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Colorectal cancer,Gene expression patterns,Gene profiling,Prognostic markers,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Eric  M.

However, patients with genomic alterations in the androgen receptor (<i>AR<\/i>) and its enhancer region do not respond well and acquire resistance to these inhibitors. Here, we applied our previously developed cell-free DNA (cfDNA) liquid biopsy assay (EnhanceAR-Seq) to detect these high-risk mCRPC patients prior to the administration of first-line AR-directed therapy and correlated with survival. We also interrogated the plasma methylome to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) across these high-risk patients. <b>Methodology<\/b>: We applied EnhanceAR-Seq to plasma cfDNA isolated from 99 mCRPC patients enrolled from two institutions (n=52 Tulane; n=47 WashU). Plasma samples were collected prior to ARSI initiation (n=63) or during treatment (n=36). We also performed Enzymatic Methyl-seq in pre-treatment plasma from 43 patients. We split these 43 patients into cell-free genomically high-risk and low-risk groups using our EnhanceAR-seq results, and conducted DMR analysis using metilene. To identify significant DMRs, we performed multiple hypothesis testing and required q&#60;0.05 using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, and further required at least 5 CpGs per DMR. <b>Results<\/b>: EnhanceAR-Seq detected <i>AR<\/i>\/enhancer alterations in 35% of all plasma samples.

To identify the mutations to be used as ctDNA targets, tumor tissue is often mutation-profiled using broad panel sequencing strategies. Optimally, the strategy for mutation profiling should enable assessment of clonality and copy number of the identified mutations. Hereby, it will be possible to rank the mutations and select those that are clonal and present in multiple copies per cancer cell. Theoretically, this should increase the ctDNA detection likelihood. However, there is no consensus on how best to identify and select the targets. Here, we propose a bioinformatic pipeline for an easy and robust selection of target mutations for ctDNA detection from tumor whole-exome sequencing (WES) profiles.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> The pipeline consists of Mutect2 and PureCN, which were both applied to paired tumor and normal WES profiles. The output from the pipeline is a list of somatic mutations, each with estimated measures of clonality, in the form of a cancer cell fraction (CCF), and multiplicity (local mutation copy number). Mutations with CCF above 0.9 were considered clonal. The performance of the pipeline was assessed using matched WES and ctDNA data from 98 colorectal cancer (CRC) and 30 bladder cancer patients. For CRC patients, 1-5 mutations per patient within a pre-defined CRC panel were used as ctDNA targets, while an average of 41 selected mutations per patient were used for bladder cancer patients. The performance measure was the mutation detection rate in pre-operative plasma samples, stratified for clonality (CCF), multiplicity, and the combination of CCF and multiplicity.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> For CRC patients, 51% of mutations with CCF &#62; 0.9 were detected compared to only 17% when CCF &#60; 0.9 (p= 4.3e-09). In bladder cancer patients 21% of mutations with CCF &#62; 0.9 were detected compared to 2 % when CCF &#60; 0.9 (p=1.2e-09). For CRC patients the ctDNA detection rate was 58% when mutation multiplicity was higher than 1 and 31% when multiplicity was 1 (p= 9.175e-06). For bladder cancer, the same numbers were 22% and 16% (p=4.635e-03). Mutations with CCF &#62; 0.9 and multiplicity &#62;1 had significantly increased ctDNA detection rate compared with mutations with CCF &#60; 0.9 and multiplicity 1, in both CRC (p= 1.486e-09) and bladder cancer (p=1.077e-09).<br \/><b>Conclusion:<\/b> The CCF and multiplicity measures provided by the pipeline are highly useful when selecting ctDNA targets. By selecting mutations with CCF&#62; 0.9 and multiplicity &#62;1 the likelihood of detecting ctDNA in plasma cfDNA is significantly improved.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"ctDNA,MRD detection,Clonal mutation,,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Marijana Nesic<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Mads H.

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) isolated from liquid biopsies of EAC patients holds clinical biomarker potential in this disease, but our understanding of how chemotherapy affects ctDNA release remains limited.<br \/>Methods: In order to study the impact of cancer treatment on ctDNA emission <i>in vitro<\/i>, we first sought to establish a chemo-resistant model of EAC. As such, the EAC cell line OE19 was exposed to discontinuous cisplatin treatments for three months in order to establish drug resistance. Following this, established chemo-resistant OE19 cells and parental (chemo-sensitive) OE19 cells were exposed to five daily cisplatin treatments, and cell culture supernatant was collected every day throughout treatment. ctDNA was subsequently isolated from cell culture supernatant and quantified by Qubit fluorometer dsDNA HS assay. ctDNA quantities were additionally assessed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay using primers and probes targeting the <i>TP53<\/i> N310K mutation in the OE19 cell line. Finally, ctDNA fragment lengths were analyzed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100.<br \/>Results: A chemo-resistant model of the OE19 cell line was established, as exemplified by marked morphological changes in the cells and significantly increased cell viability determined by CCK8 assay after 48-hour treatments of various doses of cisplatin (p&#60;0.05). ctDNA levels, as measured by both Qubit fluorometer and mutant copies detected by ddPCR assay, increased after chemotherapy treatment for both chemo-sensitive and resistant cells. Notably, ctDNA emission was higher with larger amounts cell death, with chemo-sensitive cells emitting significantly higher levels of ctDNA compared to chemo-resistant cells throughout treatment (p&#60;0.05). Fragmentomics analysis revealed ctDNA peaks corresponding to apoptosis (~167 bp) and necrosis (~10,000 bp). Moreover, chemotherapy treatment caused a shift in average fragment size, with larger fragments being observed during chemotherapy treatment in both chemo-sensitive and resistant cells.<br \/>Conclusion: This study reveals that <i>in vitro<\/i> cancer models can be used to successfully study ctDNA emission during pre-clinical drug analyses. ctDNA release was found to be correlated to cytotoxicity and cell death, providing us with valuable insight into how clinical liquid biopsy data should be interpreted. Finally, fragment size analysis of ctDNA reveals a potential novel biomarker for treatment response in cancer patients.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor DNA,Liquid biopsies,Biomarkers,Esophageal cancer,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Alexandra Bartolomucci<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Sarah Tadhg Ferrier<sup>1<\/sup>, Thupten Tsering<sup>1<\/sup>, Xin Su<sup>1<\/sup>, Jonathan Cools-Lartigue<sup>2<\/sup>, Julia V.

We aimed to perform a more systematic investigation of genomic alterations in Asia\/Taiwan NSCLC patients through the BFAST database at NTUH.<br \/>Materials and Methods: There was a total of 269 patients enrolled and receiving FoundationOne Liquid Companion Diagnostic (F1LCDx) assay at cancer diagnosis between Feb, 2019 and Mar, 2022 in NTUH. The concordance of tissue-based genetic testing in the real-life clinical setting and the blood-based NGS testing in the clinical trial were analyzed. The co-occurrence of genomic alterations detected with blood-based NGS ctDNA assay were also interpreted.<br \/>Results: A total of 206 patients (76.5%) detected driver mutations. Tissue-based genetic testing in the real-life clinical setting missed driver mutations in 67 (24.9%) patients with a sensitivity of 67.32%. Liquid NGS detected 38 (14%) patients with RET, KRAS, Met or ErbB2 mutations which were beyond the scope of current genetic testing in the clinical settings. Also, the F1LCDx assay detected more uncommon EGFR mutations than the Roche Cobas EGFR Mutation Test V2 (P &#60; 0.0001). Thirty-four (12.6%) patients had non-detected results in the F1LCDx assay which produced a sensitivity of 83.41%. By multivariate analysis, the predictors associated with discordant blood-based NGS ctDNA results were T stage (odds ratio [OR] 0.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15-0.79, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.012) and M stage (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.09-0.49, p&#8201;&#60;&#8201;0.0001). The most common co-occurring mutations in the blood-based NGS ctDNA assay were TP53, DNMT3A, TET2, PIK3CA and CTNNB1. Among the EGFR mutant population, first-generation compared to third-generation TKI use (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.43, 95% CI 0.22-0.85, P=0.02) and co-occurring genomic alterations in TET2 (HR = 2.35, 95% CI 1.15-3.48, P=0.02) were associated with shorter progression free survival of EGFR TKIs treatment in multivariate analysis. Disease stage was the only factor associated with overall survival in the EGFR mutant population.<br \/>Conclusion: NGS ctDNA analysis provided a more comprehensive genetic testing than conventional single gene testing kits. The lower stage which could imply lower or lack of ctDNA shedding into the blood was associated with a discordant result of the blood-based NGS ctDNA assay. Co-occurring mutations might have an impact on the treatment duration of EGFR-TKI.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Lung cancer: non-small cell,Circulating cell-free DNA,Cancer genomics,Mutation detection,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hsin-Yi Wang<\/b><sup>1<\/sup>, Chao-Chi Ho<sup>2<\/sup>, Yen-Ting Lin<sup>3<\/sup>, Wei-Yu Liao<sup>2<\/sup>, Chung-Yu Chen<sup>1<\/sup>, Jin-Yuan Shih<sup>2<\/sup>, Chong-Jen Yu<sup>2<\/sup><br><br\/><sup>1<\/sup>National Taiwan University Hospital, Yun-lin Branch, Yunlin, Taiwan,<sup>2<\/sup>National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan,<sup>3<\/sup>National Taiwan University Cancer Centre, Taipei, Taiwan","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"eeeaa5d9-deef-4091-976e-f0c5b457e7fb","ControlNumber":"2193","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>H.

Despite the establishment of low input library protocols, library preparation of cfDNA samples remains a challenge due to restricted amount of starting material and variable size distribution of cfDNA fragments. The yield and quality of cfDNA can vary and a lot of care is required to obtain appropriate cfDNA starting material for downstream applications. Further, cfDNA samples may contain high molecular weight (HMW) DNA that can negatively affect library yield and sequencing quality. Therefore, quality control of cfDNA starting material is essential to ensure the success of downstream experiments. The Agilent Tapestation system with the Cell-free DNA ScreenTape Assay is based on automated electrophoresis and thereby offers an objective and reliable qualification of cfDNA samples by applying the %cfDNA quality score. By comparing different samples with varying total DNA yield and HMW contamination, the additional level of information gained by the %cfDNA score is highlighted. While other QC methods might miss critical information on HMW DNA contamination, this could result in flawed yield estimations, ultimately threatening the successful outcome of downstream experiments.

Variant allele frequencies (VAFs) of ctDNA were under 0.1% even in most advanced cancer patients. Since the detection limit of next-generation sequencing (NGS) is above 1%, higher sensitivity is needed for sensitive ctDNA monitoring. Digital PCR (dPCR) offers excellent sensitivity at an affordable cost compared with NGS. A mutation-specific primer\/probe (P\/P) is required for the dPCR assay, but a limited number of P\/Ps are commercially available.<br \/>Materials and Methods: To provide essential probes for the rapid monitoring of sensitive ctDNA, we developed an off-the-shelf (OTS) dPCR P\/P library (OTS-Probes) that includes probes that can detect &#62;1,000 mutations found in human cancer. The majority of the mutations to be detected by these P\/P sets have been selected using an originally developed statistical scoring from hot spot mutations reported in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database. To evaluate the coverage of OTS-Probes in human cancer specimens, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics (C-CAT) datasets were used. TCGA is an international landmark cancer genomic program in the U.S., and C-CAT is a Japanese cancer genome profiling database.<br \/>Results: At least one mutation was matched to the OTS-Probes for ctDNA monitoring in lung, colorectum, stomach, liver, pancreas, breast, uterus, and prostate from TCGA and C-CAT cancer specimens, reflecting 63% and 77% of corresponding tumor types, respectively. The mutation coverage of the OTS-Probes tends to be lower in TCGA than in C-CAT, partially due to the fact that information about the <i>TERT <\/i>promoter mutation is absent in TCGA. We found that some<i> ARID1A<\/i> deletion mutations that have a high count in COSMIC were not observed in either the TCGA or the C-CAT database. We also analyzed the coverage of the OTS-Probes in different organs and driver genes. Currently, more than 250 P\/P sets have been designed, synthesized, and validated with human tumor DNA or synthesized DNA fragments. Importantly, nearly 98% of P\/P sets work with the same PCR condition. With our proprietary oligo synthesis method with modified bases, only a small percentage of P\/P sets required optimization of the annealing temperature.<br \/>Conclusion: We developed a dPCR P\/P library called OTS-Probes. Our analysis suggests that 60-80% of cancer patients could immediately apply at least one P\/P set for sensitive ctDNA monitoring by dPCR. A quarter of the P\/P library has already been validated by tumor DNA or synthesized DNA fragments. OTS-Probes is a great tool for ctDNA- related studies and for clinical use when a higher sensitivity than NGS can offer is required.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Liquid biopsies,Circulating tumor DNA,Databases,ctDNA,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Hayato Hiraki<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Akiko Yashima-Abo<sup><\/sup>, Takeshi Iwaya<sup><\/sup>, Satoshi  S.

Unfortunately, the scarcity of ESCC genomic data hinders the understanding of ESCC biology, disease progression and rational therapy design. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), which are shed from the primary and metastatic tumors and then circulate within the peripheral vasculature, reflect the existing tumor heterogeneity. Here, we utilized the non-biased size-based CTC enrichment strategy in combination with the real-time RT-PCR to molecularly characterize the CTCs with cancer stem cell (CSC) or mesenchymal properties in ESCC. Comprehensive data from ESCC cell lines, mouse ESCC xenograft models and clinical ESCC peripheral blood samples emphasize the importance of <i>TWIST1<\/i> (Twist Family BHLH Transcription Factor 1) in ESCC progression. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses demonstrate that TWIST1 promotes cell migration, invasion and colony formation in ESCC cells. Moreover, positive TWIST1 expression is responsible for the chemoresistance of ESCC cells to Cisplatin and is correlated with poor overall survival in ESCC patients. In addition, we show that TWIST1 promotes malignant potential, including tumor growth, invasion and chemoresistance via the TWIST1-TGFBI-ZEB1 signaling pathway in ESCC. Meanwhile, the TWIST1-TGFBI-ZEB1 signaling pathway confers immunosuppressive conditions to the tumor microenvironment, which in turn contributes to EMT to promote tumor progression. Collectively, these findings indicate that TWIST1 has a novel role in ESCC carcinogenesis by regulating tumorigenicity and cancer stem cell properties that may be useful as a prognostic monitoring biomarker and a promising therapeutic target in clinical ESCC treatment.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Esophageal cancer,Circulating tumor cells,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),Twist1,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Zhen Tan<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Josephine Mun-Yee Ko<sup><\/sup>, Valen Zhuoyou Yu<sup><\/sup>, Hoi Yan Ng<sup><\/sup>, Simon Law<sup><\/sup>, Maria Li Lung<sup><\/sup><br><br\/>The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","CSlideId":"","ControlKey":"959ceb86-1bb9-44bf-a07f-59413558e9be","ControlNumber":"790","DisclosureBlock":"&nbsp;<b>Z.

Cancer metastasis is responsible for more than 90% of all cancer-associated deaths due to treatment resistance and increased tumor burden. As a seed for metastases, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) present a new dimension and horizon for clinical doctors in diagnosis, prognosis prediction, treatment monitoring, disease mechanism, and drug development. CTCs could gradually replace tissue biopsies which are painful and may be difficult to obtain depending on tumor location. CTC isolation is feasible after minimally invasive liquid biopsy and provides the basis for a multitude of <i>ex vivo<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i> studies including establishment of CTCs-derived 2D and 3D cultures. Organoids are miniscule models of tissues that grow in a 3D semisolid extracellular matrix medium with specific growth factors supplied. CTCs-derived 3D organoids play a vital role in precision oncology because they can preserve tumor heterogeneity, imitate the tumor microenvironment (TME), mimic cancer hypoxia in the TME, and maintain cancer and metastasis phenotypes. Cytotoxic CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells are the most powerful effectors in the anticancer immune response. We hypothesized that co-culture of CTCs-derived 3D organoids and autologous cytotoxic CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells could maximize patient-relevance of laboratory assessment of cancer-treatment immune-system interactions to facilitate precision oncology practice. TellBio&#8217;s novel TellDx CTC technology allows for isolation of viable and intact CTCs in liquid biopsies, regardless of cancer type. Unlabeled CTCs were cultured in growth factor reduced Matrigel with organoid culture WENRAS medium. Magnetic beads labeled white blood cells (WBCs) were cultured with T cell culture medium - WBCs and magnetic beads usually separate in three days - cytotoxic CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells were isolated with the EasySep&#8482; Human CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T Cell Isolation Kit. CTCs-derived 3D organoids and autologous cytotoxic CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells were co-cultured with or without different drug treatments - cytotoxicity was measured with CellTiterGlo&#174; 3D Cell Viability Assay and imaging, and further mechanistic studies were feasible. Our co-culture platform enables us to utilize a patient's peripheral blood or pleural effusions to create a patient-specific, <i>in vivo<\/i>-like TME and immune microenvironment to model and assess <i>ex vivo<\/i> responses to investigational and FDA-cleared cancer therapies, and potentially provide oncologists with insights to improve clinical outcomes.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-05 Liquid biopsies: Circulating tumor cells,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Circulating tumor cells,Organoids,Precision medicine,Cytotoxic T cell,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Lanlan Zhou<\/b><sup><\/sup>, Leiqing Zhang<sup><\/sup>, Lindsey Carlsen<sup><\/sup>, Kelsey  E.

While minimizing damage to proximal healthy tissue, RT can still result in severe toxicities. Studies have shown that exposure to ionizing radiation leads to changes of miRNA expression at the cellular level, making cells more radioresistant or radiosensitive which could result in toxicity, recurrence, and metastatic spread. Importantly, RT induced miRNA changes have been found to be associated with RT response in clinical contexts and may serve as diagnostic tools to assess PCa risk stratification that inform precision medicine approaches. However, miRNAs have not been assessed in patients treated with proton therapy (PT), a type of particle-based RT which purports improved dose distribution and reduced toxicity. This is attributed to the proton&#8217;s unique ability to deposit most of its energy at a narrow bragg peak with minimal energy deposition beyond the peak, into surrounding organs. Because miRNAs are ubiquitous in the human body, they are stable in many environments including the bloodstream and are becoming attractive biomarkers of treatment response, including RT. Still, blood-derived biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy response is an emerging field and there remains a lack of standardization and normalization of sample preparation and protocol for isolating human derived miRNA from plasma. The objective is to optimize RNA isolation procedures so that it is achievable to accurately identify miRNA biomarkers in PCa patients undergoing PT.<br \/>Methods: The results of 2 RNA isolation kits were compared. To assess the effectiveness of each optimization strategy performed, a number of metrics were used to quantitate and determine the quality of the RNA: fluorometry (Qubit 2.0 and 4.0), spectrophotometry (nano-drop), and qRT-PCR amplification (Taqman).<br \/>Results: Fluorometry methods were not sensitive enough for RNA quantification for either kit. Of the two RNA isolation kits, Kit A outperformed Kit B in every metric output when 100 uL of plasma was initially used. Furthermore, amelioration of metric output was observed when the original starting plasma amount of 100 uL was increased to 200 uL in Kit A. Nanodrop quantities ranged from 8.85 - 32.65 ng\/uL and -72.82 - 4.98 ng\/uL using Kit A and Kit B, respectively. The quality (260\/280 ratios) ranged from -7.65 - 3.17 and -41.65 - 6.13 for Kit A and Kit B, respectively. Taqman amplification was achieved for both kits.<br \/>Conclusions: Although total RNA isolation was effectively performed, there is a need for properly optimizing miRNA detection in these blood-based biopsies. Enhancing miRNA detection to determine treatment outcomes may result in miRNA&#8217;s becoming a powerful predictive biomarker. The goal is to utilize miRNAs as a diagnostic tool for real time monitoring of individualized therapy response, detecting developing metastases, and predicting relapse.","Actions":[{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Abstract","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewAbstract","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"View Video","SubType":null,"Type":"ViewPlayer","Url":null},{"Icon":null,"Label":"Rating","SubType":null,"Type":"Rating","Url":null}],"Activity":"Abstract Submission","AdditionalFields":[{"Key":"Topics","Value":"++CL01-04 Liquid biopsies: Circulating nucleic acids,,"},{"Key":"Keywords","Value":"Prostate cancer,Biomarkers,MicroRNA,Proton Therapy,"},{"Key":"ePosterClassification","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterNote","Value":""},{"Key":"VideoType","Value":""},{"Key":"cSlidePresentationId","Value":""},{"Key":"ePosterLink","Value":""},{"Key":"WebcastProgramPlannerLink","Value":""}],"AdditionalFiles":[],"AllowAttendeeRating":"False","AttendeeRatingAvg":"0","AttendeeRatingCount":"0","AuthorBlock":"<b>Johnny  I.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) have shown potential as diagnostic biomarkers. Unfortunately, the identification of non-coding RNA circulating biomarkers in blood serum is significantly burdened by abundant RNA specimens from disrupted blood cells. Recently, small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) emerged as potential reservoirs of clinically relevant biomarkers, including lncRNAs and miRNAs. In theory, sEVs protect RNAs from degradation and might serve as a source of intact RNA for further analyses. However, there is a lack of evidence supporting the superior quality of RNA extracted from sEVs over RNA from whole blood serum. This study aimed to analyze the RNA content of blood serum and the sEVs derived from the blood serum of CRC patients and healthy controls using RNA sequencing. Moreover, small RNA sequencing was used to evaluate the difference in miRNA profiles of sEVs and corresponding blood sera of CRC patients and healthy controls.<br \/><b>Methods:<\/b> Spin-column chromatography (Exiqon), precipitation-based method (Norgen), and size-exclusion chromatography (iZON) were used to extract sEVs from blood sera. The concentration of sEVs was measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS), the size was evaluated by electron microscopy (EM), and sEV-specific content was analyzed by western blot and qRT-PCR. RNA was extracted using the column-based method. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analyses of blood serum and sEVs extracted from blood serum included samples from 10 CRC patients and 10 healthy controls for RNAseq, and 5 CRC patients and 5 healthy controls for small RNAseq. Differential expression analysis was carried out in R using DESeq2 package.<br \/><b>Results:<\/b> DLS and EM showed that size-exclusion chromatography yielded the purest population of sEVs characterized according to ISEV recommendations. Extraction of sEVs and subsequent RNA extraction and sequencing library preparation from ultra-low input samples were optimized. Over 30k different RNAs were identified in the sEVs derived from blood sera of CRC patients and healthy controls, including lncRNAs, miRNAs, and protein-coding RNAs.
