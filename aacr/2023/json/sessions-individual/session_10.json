It could therefore be advantageous to have the means to predict those individuals at risk of developing such ICI-induced immune-related adverse events (irAEs) so that interventions for such complications could be initiated in the timeliest fashion. It may be individual humans exist with a genetic makeup predisposing them to autoimmune diseases, but fail to develop such pathologies solely due to the maintenance of immunological checkpoint mediator activities. Thus, it is such individuals that would be prone to develop ICI-induced autoimmunity complications. This AACR session is dedicated to discussion of checkpoint blockade induced irAEs, and how they might be predicted.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"10","Key":"ef49c6ac-56ab-47db-85f3-920537b590c2","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Valencia BC - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY25","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Immunology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"bd4b7f63-21dc-4421-a11e-628f36cc56fe","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY25.
