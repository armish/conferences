In this session, we will present new methods allowing to track the different steps of tumor initiation and progression by intravital microscopy in living animals, to dissect the molecular mechanisms regulating tumor heterogeneity and their interactions with stromal cells using single cell approaches and genetic engineering, to develop human derived xenotransplantation and organoids to predict the response to therapy and patient survival. All these different pre-clinical approaches will be critical to identify new tumor vulnerabilities and better translate basic discovery into therapeutical applications.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"120","Key":"67949253-263b-400e-99eb-5fab4e0da030","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Valencia D - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED033","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Molecular\/Cellular Biology and Genetics","PrimaryCategory_keys":"adb9ab13-bf74-46ef-b90d-2033fedb560c","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED033.
