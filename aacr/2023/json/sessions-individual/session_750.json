This session will help you discover how NCI can help you prepare for your next career stage. While NCI is primarily known for funding cancer research across the nation, there are also numerous fellowships available to conduct basic, clinical, or genomic and population-based research at one of the three NCI campuses in Maryland. You will hear about training opportunities as well as career exploration and professional development resources provided to trainees within the intramural research program. For those training at extramural institutions, you will learn about funding opportunities for postdocs and early-stage investigators that will help with your transition to independence. Following this broad overview of opportunities, the remaining time will be spent answering questions from the audience.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 11:15:00 AM","EndTime":"11:15","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"750","Key":"2eb044a8-60f0-4ca4-992b-4b7d165e9295","LastUpdated":"2023-04-05 13:00","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W314 A - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"NIH04","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"NIH04.
