Different approaches are under development to therapeutically target myeloid cells in cancer, including strategies to deplete, inhibit, reprogram or activate myeloid cells. The presentations in this session will discuss emerging clinical strategies for myeloid cell modulation in cancer. The different talks will illustrate how fundamental research into the regulation and function of myeloid cells, combined with translational and clinical studies, opens new avenues for cancer treatment.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/16\/2023 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"48","Key":"4bc003fc-333f-4fa7-9d73-1f87b866681d","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Valencia D - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY15","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY15.
