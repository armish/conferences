Major governing bodies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Society of Gynecologic Oncology have called attention to the stark racial differences in uterine cancer outcomes, calling for an end to the ‘‘unnecessary death’’ that ‘‘disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities.’’ Multiple factors have been reported to play a role in disparate outcomes including access to care, socioeconomic factors, histologic tumor subtype, tumor stage at diagnosis,  molecular\/genetic factors, comorbidities,  as well as the role structural racism, poverty, and implicit bias play in the United States health system overall. This session seeks to provide an overview of disparities present in gynecologic cancer, as well as offer a review on the multifactorial etiology of the disparities described. We will review evidence-based methods for overcoming disparities and explore ongoing research to optimize outcomes, expand access to care, and increase provider awareness for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of gynecologic cancers.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"644","Key":"6a547461-8978-4afa-a600-fe0736e89d54","LastUpdated":"2023-03-30 23:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W330 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME24","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME24.
