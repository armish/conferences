Never the less their molecular features and pathways remain elusive and poorly characterized, such as the characteristics of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). These cells are are known to promote a suppressive environment for effector T cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) and support tumor growth and immune dysfunction. Despite the critical effect of MDSCs on treatment outcome in a broad spectrum of cancer types, their precise functional roles and molecular identity have been elusive. Over the last several years disruptive single cell multiomics and genome engineering technologies are rapidly enhancing our understanding of this critical immune compartment. Indeed, novel myeloid checkpoints are actively being developed and have emerged as as potent therapeutic targets for PD-1 resistant tumors. This session will discuss the complex crosstalk between effector cells and myeloid cells and the huge potential to harness myeloid based therapies for effective antitumor immune responses.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"46","Key":"8384bd61-ff22-4524-9620-dbf1791991aa","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Valencia D - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY14","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY14.
