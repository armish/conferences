To prevent reinfection, effector T cells differentiate into long-lived memory T cells that either recirculate or establish long-lived immune protection throughout the body as tissue-resident memory T cells. Tissue-resident memory T cells constitute a large portion of the T cell memory population, can remain lodged in tissues for the lifetime of the organism, and offer a rapid and potent first line of defense due to their enhanced effector functions and proximity to sites of reinfection. Thus, promoting tissue-resident memory T cell formation can improve protection from viral and bacterial infections and even tumor growth. This session will cover what is known about the function and differentiation of tissue-resident memory T cells and the current understanding of their role in anti-tumor immunity.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"139","Key":"81ff640f-4f5a-47e4-9a20-72b429135ffc","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 1 (WF1) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED042","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Immunology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"bd4b7f63-21dc-4421-a11e-628f36cc56fe","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED042.
