Join us to learn how integrating 3D genomics into multi-omic approaches improves biomarker discovery, tumor classification, and patient stratification. In this session, Anthony Schmitt, PhD, Senior Vice President of Science at Arima Genomics, will share examples of how 3D genomics reveals genetic drivers of previously undiagnosed tumors and provides exciting new opportunities in cancer research and beyond. Anthony will be joined by Ilaria Iacobucci, PhD, of St. Jude Research Hospital, who will share her experience using 3D genomic techniques to understand how alterations in chromatin conformation underly the pathogenesis of high-risk myeloid and lymphoid leukemia.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\u000a","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 11:00:00 AM","EndTime":"11:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"594","Key":"f94e7988-40dc-40a5-98cc-2851d94cbc5c","LastUpdated":"2023-04-11 17:18","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater D","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>Arima Genomics<\/p>\u000a","Number":"ESP06D","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ESP06D.
