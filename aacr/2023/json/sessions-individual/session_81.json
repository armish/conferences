However, tumor can overcome AR-targeting, adopting drug-resistant phenotypes. A key challenge in improving prostate cancer patient outcome is the need for identifying subtypes of the disease based on clinically-relevant biomarkers that can guide the development of new therapeutics. In this session, we will discuss innovative approaches to subclassify prostate cancer based on delineating relevant features of the tumor and its microenvironment from integrating <i>in-vitro<\/i>, <i>in-vivo<\/i> and patient biospecimen studies. The presentations will cover the identification of distinct phenotypes based on epigenetic profiling of castration-resistant prostate cancer, functional biomarkers of DNA damage repair proficiency or the engagement of an immune response, and their therapeutic implications. We aim to go beyond genomic profiling to match disease phenotypes to treatment strategies. Moreover, we will review latest advances in the understanding of prostate cancer plasticity under therapeutic pressure, with a focus on novel therapeutic strategies to target the emergence of drug resistance.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/19\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"81","Key":"e8272f2f-9302-41fa-9e6a-94acb0de4b4a","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 3-4 (WF3-4) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AOS06","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Research Excluding Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"3b5a3215-acba-4a28-ad12-c29462d32f97","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AOS06.
