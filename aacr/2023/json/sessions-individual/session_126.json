The current state of the art involves a combination of measurement modalities (e.g. deep tissue imaging and spatial omics) that reveal the positions, identities and states of tumor, stromal and immune cells in conjunction with measurement (by mass spectrometry imaging) of metabolite and drug levels. When combined with methods to perturb genes in living animals using barcoded CRISPR libraries (Perturb-map), spatial profiling makes it possible to study the precise functions of genes in the preserved 3D environment of normal and disease tissues. This session will describe the use of experimental and computational approaches to spatial profiling and perturbation in the study of melanoma, breast cancer, and lung cancer in human and patients and murine models.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"126","Key":"60fe6154-48ab-473c-acfb-4892db379b0e","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Valencia A - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW009","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Molecular\/Cellular Biology and Genetics","PrimaryCategory_keys":"adb9ab13-bf74-46ef-b90d-2033fedb560c","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW009.
