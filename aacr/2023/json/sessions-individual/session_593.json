Due to its noninvasive nature, availability and accessibility, liquid biopsy offers an alternative sampling option when tissue is unavailable or insufficient. In this presentation, we demonstrate the following: 1) The utility of an NGS-based ctDNA testing approach for therapy selection in advanced cancers; 2) Tissue-agnostic treatment response monitoring in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and its prognostic value in guiding treatment decisions.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 11:00:00 AM","EndTime":"11:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"593","Key":"f1d8fb6d-e293-4eed-9a64-f6bc96c74746","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater C","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>Labcorp Oncology<\/p>\u000a","Number":"ESP06C","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ESP06C.
