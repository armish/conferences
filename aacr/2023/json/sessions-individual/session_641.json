While there has been much progress in characterizing the pathways that contribute to stable genetic drug resistance, non-genetic mechanisms have recently emerged as important drivers of therapy failure in cancer.  In my presentation, I will discuss different types of non-genetic, reversible mechanisms that confer therapy resistance, those involving immediate adaptive responses to stresses associated with therapies, and the other states associated with longer term persistence. I will include a discussion of strategies to target the vulnerabilities associated with each of these adaptive responses.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"641","Key":"993ef352-d8be-42c3-9219-5de40e3ef224","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W240 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME23","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME23.
