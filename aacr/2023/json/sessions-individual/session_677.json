Our laboratory has applied functional genomic approaches to the 1) generation of a Pediatric Cancer Dependency Map, 2) identification of mechanisms of drug response and resistance, and 3) identification of mechanisms regulating targets of interest, such as oncogenic fusion proteins and immunotherapy targets. In this presentation, I will describe our latest insights from the application of functional genomic approaches to cancer-focused investigation.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"677","Key":"3ca27f9a-0e5d-4822-b52a-4f22a519d48c","LastUpdated":"2023-04-03 16:39","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 3-4 (WF3-4) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME34","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME34.
