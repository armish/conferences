New evidence supports the contribution of other organs and cell lineages than the primary tumor in the process of cancer progression, thus providing new potential targets to halt this process and increase patient quality of life and survival. In this session, we will provide an overview of how signals from the central nervous system contribute to cancer progression via their effect on cancer cells, stroma, and immune cells. We will also discuss the relationship between tumor cells and local and distal tumor immunity, tumor angiogenesis impacting tumor immunity and immune checkpoint blockade therapy response, and how this new knowledge may translate into new cancer therapies.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"163","Key":"12bf7185-96f0-4827-85ed-387047d23581","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Valencia BC - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED011","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED011.
