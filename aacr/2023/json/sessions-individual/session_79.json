This shift to CRC diagnoses at younger ages is considered strong evidence for an underlying role of life style and environmental factors. Yet, surprisingly, little is known about the causal mechanisms of early tumor initiation events which is critical for designing new disease prevention strategies. Moreover, new therapies that prevent disease relapse is required since 30-40% of patients will develop metastases upon curative resection. In this session, the speakers will discuss their latest findings that traverse CRC initiation, progression, and ultimately, treatment resistance and metastasis. These new findings include the identification of mutational signatures associated with established risk factors in human tumors and colonic crypts, the illustration of crypt dynamics and cellular fates (survival vs loss) of mutant intestinal cells using intravital microscopy, and the detection of high-relapse cells that cause residual disease after curative surgical resection.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/16\/2023 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"79","Key":"9ac874a1-e256-41ee-b53e-5f693d7b886b","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W331 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AOS04","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Research Excluding Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"3b5a3215-acba-4a28-ad12-c29462d32f97","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AOS04.
