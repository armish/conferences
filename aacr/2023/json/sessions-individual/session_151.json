Autopsy programs offer an unprecedented opportunity to more fully comprehend the intricacies of the metastatic cascade across multiple sites of disease allowing the underlying influences of the tumour microenvironment upon selection of cancer subclones to be inferred. In this session, results from 3 autopsy programs will be presented that offer insights into the complexity of genomic instability processes, mutational signatures and immune evasive strategies that manifest during the metastatic process throughout tumour evolution. Through such efforts, evolutionary rule books can begin to be deciphered governing tumour progression, immune escape and drug resistance.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"151","Key":"72fe974a-dec1-4498-b6b2-fe0799850aed","LastUpdated":"2023-04-03 22:22","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W331 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED052","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED052.
