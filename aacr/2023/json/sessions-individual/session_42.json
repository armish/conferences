In this session we will discuss the development of regulatory, effector and memory CD4 and CD8 T cells and the stability of these fate choices at the epigenetic level. PD-1 blockade reinvigorates a subset of stem-like progenitor CD8 T cells. How this key subset of cells is maintained and the role of PD-1 signaling on T cell states from naïve to memory cells will be explored. TCR signaling is also centrally important in naïve T cell priming and in effector cell recognition of tumor antigens presented on MHC. Decreasing the T cell signaling threshold increases effector cell cytokine production and can recruit lower affinity, self-antigen specific T cells into the anti-tumor pool. T cell exhaustion and methods of preventing or overcoming exhaustion will be discussed.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"42","Key":"fbe8040b-d48d-4748-9314-da77eaef85ef","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Valencia A - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY12","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Immunology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"bd4b7f63-21dc-4421-a11e-628f36cc56fe","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY12.
