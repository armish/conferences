EVPs are essential for cell-to-cell communication with the ability to “reprogram” cells, such as immune cells, to a pro-tumor phenotype. Moreover, EVPs can alter the local tumor microenvironment, promote formation of pre-metastatic and metastatic niches at organotropic sites, and mediate additional systemic effects, such as immune dysregulation and organ failure, of cancer. Thus, advancing EVP isolation and characterization will be crucial for expanding our understanding of EVP biology and function as well as the identification of biomarkers for cancer diagnostics and prognostics. In addition, deciphering the unique biodistribution patterns of various EVPs subsets or from distinct sources will impact their role as delivery vehicles for cancer therapeutics. Here, we addressed the essential functional roles and systemic effects of EVPs in cancer progression.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"184","Key":"7e989df1-1bc5-4dff-9c45-a09fbebe53c3","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W331 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED019","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Molecular\/Cellular Biology and Genetics","PrimaryCategory_keys":"adb9ab13-bf74-46ef-b90d-2033fedb560c","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED019.
