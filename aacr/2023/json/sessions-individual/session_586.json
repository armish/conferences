However, it is often difficult to transition results from these molecular studies to the clinic. This session will present examples showing how expression profiling combined with TCR\/BCR clonotype analysis, and in vivo CRISPR mutagenic screening using barcoded libraries guide libraries are able to uncover genetic targets with clinical and therapeutic relevance.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"586","Key":"d0da7a2d-747f-4dfb-ba56-468912e99a09","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater A","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>Cellecta<\/p>\u000a","Number":"ESP05A","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ESP05A.
