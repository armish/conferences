Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has multiple potential uses in clinical trials to help expedite drug development for early-stage solid tumors including for patient selection and stratification, enrichment for high-risk populations, and as an early response biomarker. FDA recently published a draft guidance regarding drug development and clinical trial design issues related to the use of ctDNA for solid tumor malignancies in the early-stage setting. To address the need for a standardized approach to assess the role of ctDNA as a potential biomarker, there are other ongoing public-private partnership efforts to accelerate the development and validation of standardized liquid biopsy assays for solid tumors. This session will update the cancer research community on the FDA guidance and other various efforts from multiple stakeholders on the use of liquid biopsies in early-stage, solid tumor drug development.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"692","Key":"b20abd27-41a3-4853-9b29-be4ffa14bcaa","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W315 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DC14","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Regulatory Science and Policy","PrimaryCategory_keys":"b441e0de-a219-40b6-975f-b6340977f0c0","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"DC14.
