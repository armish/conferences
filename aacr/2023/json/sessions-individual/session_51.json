Analyses of whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing of 1,837 precancer genomes across 24 types of human premalignancies will be presented alongside an analysis of the molecular events enriched and depleted during evolutionary trajectories from precancer to cancer with a focus on eosophageal cancer. Switching focus to early colorectal cancers, the limitations of current mouse models and developments to improve them will be presented alongside human patient data pointing towards ways to intervene early to reactivate innate immune responses that may take advantage of new neoadjuvant options emerging in localised disease. Finally, the potential of liquid biopsies, combining ctDNA and rare cell analysis outputs together with radiomics of LD-CT scans will be reviewed as an approach with potential to augment LD-CT screening for lung cancer early detection.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/16\/2023 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"51","Key":"1308de3e-b010-45d8-95aa-b738ad9147dd","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Valencia A - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT03","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Prevention \/ Early Detection \/ Interception","PrimaryCategory_keys":"fe4903b1-5af5-4508-908c-2e0994986a26","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT03.
