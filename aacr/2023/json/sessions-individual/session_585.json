Recent innovations, and the advent of spectral flow, have led to ever more complex assays. This has led to an increased interest in using flow cytometry for non-exploratory assays such as pharmacokinetics and receptor occupancy analysis. These assays, however, can be more challenging to develop and run effectively. This presentation will discuss how to overcome these challenges, and deliver key insights on how to maximize the value of flow cytometry in a clinical setting.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 1:30:00 PM","EndTime":"13:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"585","Key":"aea70cdf-cc6f-4bf1-84e8-c94a44d048b2","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater E","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>Precision for Medicine<\/p>\u000a","Number":"ESP04E","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ESP04E.
