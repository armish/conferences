As such, cancer remains the second-leading cause of death in the U.S. and is projected to reach #1 by 2030. MCED blood tests designed to detect a variety of tumor markers associated with multiple cancer types are being developed to help detect cancer prior to symptom onset. An innovative multi-biomarker class MCED test in development shows promise in early cancer detection. As part of routine care, it may help shift the paradigm in cancer screening and help reduce its burden.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 1:30:00 PM","EndTime":"13:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"597","Key":"c2ace50d-8678-478d-bbfc-e1e97403c037","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater B","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>Exact Sciences<\/p>\u000a","Number":"ESP07B","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ESP07B.
