Within the extracellular matrix environment, there are multiple parameters that affect invasion. The development of model systems that mimic biologically relevant factors and extracellular matrix cues are essential for a comprehensive understanding of cancer cell invasion as well as inform therapy design. In this session, we will discuss design, development, and application of novel microphysiological systems that incorporate dynamic chemical, mechanical, and cellular (i.e. stromal cells or immune cells) cues to study tumor cell movement.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"132","Key":"449aa83e-587c-497b-bb98-94a50c4a9823","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W312 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW014","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW014.
