Nevertheless, the assignment of individual RBPs to specific roles in malignant transformation remains a daunting challenge. This is in part because the large number of RBPs described to date (over 2000 family members), most of which have yet to be functionally characterized. In this session we will learn about findings and technologies related to RBP function involving mRNA splicing, mRNA stability and cytoplasmic polyadenylation that set the proof of concept for translational applications. In particular, RBPs will be presented with unexpected implications in the response to chronic stress and nutrient deprivation, as well as in the control of metastatic progression and immune modulation. As such, these RPB could represent putative biomarkers for diagnosis and targets for therapeutic intervention.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"140","Key":"eb530bf8-3fe4-486f-b54b-4d20aec38494","LastUpdated":"2023-03-30 23:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 3-4 (WF3-4) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED043","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Molecular\/Cellular Biology and Genetics","PrimaryCategory_keys":"adb9ab13-bf74-46ef-b90d-2033fedb560c","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED043.
