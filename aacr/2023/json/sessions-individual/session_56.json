Data-driven tools can create personalized screening and treatment models, predict adverse events, and guide clinical care. However, integrating these tools across health systems and ensuring equitable benefits across populations remains a challenge. The session aims to highlight successful use cases of the development of equitable digital health technologies in cancer care, offer insights to improve the integration of these tools across systems, and discuss ways to scale and sustain clinical decision support tools in oncological care.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"56","Key":"8fd38885-50e2-4e12-866f-474745095051","LastUpdated":"2023-03-30 23:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W311 E-H - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY39","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Bioinformatics \/ Computational Biology \/ Systems Biology \/ Convergent Science","PrimaryCategory_keys":"48d8ff66-f809-4191-ba2b-5f22b0f95ef3","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY39.
