CRC is driven by key signature mutations including APC and p53 loss and KRAS oncogenic activation, and further fueled by hyper-mutational mechanisms involving mismatch repair deficiency or telomere-based chromosomal instability (CIN). Harnessing genetically engineered mouse models and correlative translational human data, there is now a deeper mechanistic understanding how each of the key signature and mutational process contributes to specific cancer hallmarks including metabolic reprogramming, genomic instability, stem cell biology, tumor immunity, among others. This lecture will provide of didactic review of the latest research on how APC loss, p53 loss &amp; telomere crisis, and oncogenic KRAS contribute to the initiation, progression and metastases of CRC. These mechanistic insights and promising preclinical experimental therapeutic studies have informed clinical path hypotheses for innovative clinical trials for targeted and immune therapies. This session will present examples of such rational precision therapeutic strategies.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"647","Key":"e0128194-0f64-4b43-aed1-f75ba4d4b961","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W230 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME26","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME26.
