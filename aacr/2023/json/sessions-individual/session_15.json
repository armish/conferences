Maybe your research hypothesis does not match with your statistical hypothesis. Or maybe your sample size is too small for your objective. What was your gut reaction? Were you annoyed or frustrated? In this forum we will discuss what makes a good and poor study design, key elements for making that distinction, and the importance of having biostatistics collaboration at the beginning of your research lifecycle. Dr. Mori will present an overview of study designs, myths and common mistakes that are typically observed in grant applications, manuscripts and protocols. Dr. Cabanski will present illustrative examples from clinical research, while Dr. Shyr will provide examples from basic and translational research involving discovery science and omics studies. In the panel discussion, we will engage the audience and discuss study designs and biostatisticians perspectives on a wide range of current topics such as studies of rare diseases, N of 1 trials, evaluation of precision medicine strategies, and studies involving high dimensional spatial multi-omics data.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 6:30:00 PM","EndTime":"18:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"15","Key":"a2726f24-21b9-4036-812c-fa5f8287b579","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W311 A-D - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"FO05","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Bioinformatics \/ Computational Biology \/ Systems Biology \/ Convergent Science","PrimaryCategory_keys":"48d8ff66-f809-4191-ba2b-5f22b0f95ef3","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"FO05.
