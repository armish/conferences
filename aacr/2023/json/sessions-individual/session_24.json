Our session will provide an overview and snapshot into approaches for integrating the evolutionary dynamics of the disease into therapeutic approaches designed to delay chemo-resistance using longitudinal patient data from clinical trials, computer simulations based on evolutionary principles, mathematical models, bioinformatic approaches  based on population genetic theory and statistical inference applied to genomic and spatially-resolved clinical cohorts, as well as methods from AI.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/19\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"24","Key":"5b954f0c-2314-49d0-9479-11c6ab2b7a43","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W311 A-D - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY29","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Bioinformatics \/ Computational Biology \/ Systems Biology \/ Convergent Science","PrimaryCategory_keys":"48d8ff66-f809-4191-ba2b-5f22b0f95ef3","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY29.
