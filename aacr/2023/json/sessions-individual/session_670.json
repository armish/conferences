Increasing knowledge on the mechanisms of acquired resistance has resulted in novel targeted approaches that are under clinical evaluation. This has also paved the way for the development of next generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors that can specifically target the C797 mutation, which is observed in ~10% of patients treated with a third-generation inhibitor. This session will provide an overview on current treatment approaches to EGFR mutated lung cancer, discuss EGFR-dependent- and independent resistance mechanisms and describe ongoing efforts to overcome acquired resistance. Data from recent clinical trials and details regarding key ongoing trials will be reviewed.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"670","Key":"5094ab64-1fec-43f2-8e1c-28d510af43b5","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 1 (WF1) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME32","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Research Excluding Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"3b5a3215-acba-4a28-ad12-c29462d32f97","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME32.
