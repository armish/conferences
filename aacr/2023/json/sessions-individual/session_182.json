As such, they are powerful technologies for cancer research, with potential to illuminate cellular and acellular components that drive tumor initiation, growth, invasion and response to therapies. However, analytical challenges must be overcome to fully exploit these technologies to cancer research. In this session, we will present computational advancements in the analysis of high-dimensional spatial images, common analytical pitfalls and applications of multiplexed imaging to study cancer.<\/p>\u000a","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"182","Key":"fdd49147-f8e7-405b-9217-37092d7f615b","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 3-4 (WF3-4) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED021","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Bioinformatics \/ Computational Biology \/ Systems Biology \/ Convergent Science","PrimaryCategory_keys":"48d8ff66-f809-4191-ba2b-5f22b0f95ef3","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED021.
