It will define major categories of tumor antigens, their localization, and why only some of them may elicit spontaneous immunity. The interplay between immune cells and tumor antigens is hampered by tumor-intrinsic features, such as antigen heterogeneity\/loss or MHC loss as well as by immune cell-intrinsic dysfunction, including tolerance or poor functionality, but also extrinsic factors in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, the session will also focus on challenges to antigen recognition, such as host factors including metabolism and microbiota, as well as ways to enhance their recognition by targeting stroma.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"150","Key":"76dbabd6-37a9-44d8-b267-901594552e67","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Chapin Theater - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED051","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Immunology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"bd4b7f63-21dc-4421-a11e-628f36cc56fe","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED051.
