PRO data are typically collected at regular intervals during a cancer clinical trial using patient-completed questionnaires.  PROs can elicit information about treatment harms (e.g., side effects) and benefits (e.g., maintenance or improvement of disease symptoms, physical function, or other domains of health-related quality of life). While PROs have traditionally been used in phase III trials, new approaches to PRO assessment have enabled meaningful use of PROs in earlier phase trials. In this session, we will discuss these new approaches including item banks and item libraries for creating patient surveys tailored to the trial treatments, novel designs for integrating PROs in dose-finding trials, and statistical analysis and visualization approaches to support interpretation of data in early phase trials.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/14\/2023 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"166","Key":"ae486331-69c0-4069-9859-62bfd0c56116","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W311 E-H - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED013","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"4668ebd3-0460-4c09-a084-82a9f9fccb0f","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED013.
