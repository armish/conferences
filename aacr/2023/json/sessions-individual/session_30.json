Various steps in RNA processing, such as splicing and polyadenylation, are crucial for the correct expression of genes and are tightly controlled in normal cells. However, alterations of these RNA regulatory programs in cancer can lead to the dysregulation of gene expression that promotes tumor formation, metastasis, or drug resistance. Dysregulation of RNA processing can also impact tumor-immune interactions that unveil new therapeutic opportunities. Understanding the mechanisms underlying RNA regulation in health and disease will provide critical insights into the biology of cancer and should lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/16\/2023 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"30","Key":"c0addeb6-95d5-4407-b7d3-90655f95a606","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 3-4 (WF3-4) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY04","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Molecular\/Cellular Biology and Genetics","PrimaryCategory_keys":"adb9ab13-bf74-46ef-b90d-2033fedb560c","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY04.
