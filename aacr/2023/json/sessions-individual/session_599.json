To this end, we are focused on developing new products that can accelerate oncology pre-clinical research and drug development. This workshop will highlight two application areas of our current focus: 2-D and 3-D models for the Human Cancer Models Initiative (HCMI) and reporter models and primary cells for immuno-oncology&ndash;based therapeutics. Join this session to learn about organoids, neurospheres, conditionally reprogrammed cells, CAR-T Target reporters for assessing effector cell potency, checkpoint inhibitor reporters, and primary CD8+ cytotoxic T cells.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 1:30:00 PM","EndTime":"13:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"599","Key":"392939ce-00aa-48cf-bc93-ae76e2b56c1a","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater D","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>ATCC<\/p>\u000a","Number":"ESP07D","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ESP07D.
