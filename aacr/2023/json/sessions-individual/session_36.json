It is now appreciated that amidst this tissue also exists a metabolic landscape that can act as a checkpoint on immunity. In this session, we will discuss how immune metabolism is skewed in cancer and how these metabolic balances can be tipped to promote antitumor immunity.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"36","Key":"adb9e578-bf63-4d92-8a00-b8a1ceca0a02","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Valencia BC - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY10","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Immunology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"bd4b7f63-21dc-4421-a11e-628f36cc56fe","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY10.
