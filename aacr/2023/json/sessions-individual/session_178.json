The N-terminal domains of GSDMs are released by proteolytic cleavage, and they oligomerize and puncture the plasma membrane to cause cytolytic pyroptosis, which releases immune mediators and alerts the immune system. Recent research supports the idea of cancer-associated pyroptosis in which cancer cells die as a result of the cleavage of GSDMs. There is proof that after controlled delivery of an active GSDM into tumors in mice, about 15% of the tumor cells undergo pyroptosis. This is enough to completely eradicate the 4T1 mammary tumor graft. This response is absent in immune-deficient mice or after T-cell depletion. Cytotoxic lymphocytes rely on granzymes to kill target tumor cells expressing GSDMs. In this session, we will explore the emerging role of pyroptosis in anti-tumor immunity with the purpose that our understanding of this strategy may provide clues for the development of more effective treatments for cancers.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"178","Key":"28f9ad33-da5b-435e-b0d7-f7aca03edc0b","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Valencia BC - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED024","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED024.
