This session will discuss preclinical and clinical gene-engineering strategies to enhance cellular therapy against solid cancers. This includes presentations on the use of synthetic biology to endow T cells with novel receptors and signaling circuits that improve their targeting and control against immunotherapy-refractory solid tumors; the longitudinal characterization of neoantigen-reactive T-cell responses in patients treated with immune-checkpoint blockade therapy and the isolation of their T-cell receptors (TCRs) for potential therapy; and the use of TCR-gene therapy targeting driver mutations in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal cancer.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/19\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"68","Key":"ffff4755-5e74-4ebd-a20c-35218b169bbd","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 2 (WF2) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY19","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Research Excluding Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"3b5a3215-acba-4a28-ad12-c29462d32f97","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY19.
