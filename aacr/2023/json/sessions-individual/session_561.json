We measured multiple biomarkers of aging, including leukocyte telomere length, epigenetic age and clonal hematopoiesis, to demonstrate the phenomenon of accelerated aging, evaluate the influence of cancer treatment exposures, health behaviors and social determinants of health, and further assess how these aging biomarkers are associated with specific CHCs, severity\/burden of all CHCs, and premature mortality among childhood cancer survivors.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"561","Key":"37cd5d14-1c2a-4995-a7b8-82eafbea9c6f","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W240 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME01.
