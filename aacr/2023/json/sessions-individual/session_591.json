Regulatory updates allow for rapid expansion and tech innovations must keep pace. Dr. Kiesslich highlights approaches to generate bulk spheroids and organoids. Corning equips researchers with scaffold\/scaffold-free solutions providing consistent and reproducible results.<\/p><p>Cancer treatments are being identified at record pace with eligible patients expanding. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) preserve tumor-specific antigens that are lost in standard models, giving an excellent system to investigate engagement, action mechanisms and patient populations. Dr. Boj discusses the development of autologous PDO biobanks for testing immuno-oncological compounds and co-culture assays.<\/p>","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 11:00:00 AM","EndTime":"11:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"591","Key":"c21f8396-2dfa-4ae2-a6b7-c09538b25886","LastUpdated":"2023-03-30 23:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater A","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>Corning Incorporated<\/p>\u000a","Number":"ESP06A","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ESP06A.
