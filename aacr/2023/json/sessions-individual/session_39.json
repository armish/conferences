This session will discuss the therapeutic potential of biological and molecular mechanisms operating in solid cancers driven by genomic alterations notoriously difficult to target such as those involving p53, c-Myc and c-Myb. Topics explored will include ubiquitination-dependent mechanisms of cancer cell plasticity in p53-mutated squamous cell carcinoma, phosphoinositide kinase activities and targeting in p53-deficient breast cancer, and Notch signaling in c-Myb-driven adenoid cystic carcinoma. The speakers will discuss in vivo models generated to assess the biological significance of these processes and to provide support for their potential therapeutic value.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"39","Key":"bf28b986-d92a-4d97-871a-156ec2c073be","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W304 A-D - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY33","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Drug Development","PrimaryCategory_keys":"1b9cdf0a-9d16-4a07-a5ef-2fc8884e0367","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY33.
