Key elements to achieve this include sufficient target validation, decisive target-tailored in vitro and in vivo assays, in-depth translational exploration, mode of action elucidation and understanding of PK-PD relationship. In this presentation we will show real-life project examples how we scientifically helped to identify the best compounds, to compensate liabilities, to generate biomarker strategies and to diversify and expand potential patient populations.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/16\/2023 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"575","Key":"a72f9f8b-aa0b-46af-9567-a060433fb5a0","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater E","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>Nuvisan<\/p>\u000d\u000a","Number":"ESP02E","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ESP02E.
