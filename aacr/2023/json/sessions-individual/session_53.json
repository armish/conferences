Heterogeneity in their malignant and nonmalignant components has been shown to underpin drug resistance, relapse, and metastasis. However, until recently, most genomic studies had been technically limited to examining tumors in bulk, hindering analyses of underlying cellular diversity and its relationship to clinical responses. As a result of recent advances in single-cell genomic and spatial profiling, we can now characterize intra- and intertumoral variability at unprecedented resolution. While this is helping us refine lists of component cell types\/states, chart their relative positions, and discover associations with clinical outcomes, it has yet to yield an actionable understanding of tumor biology. In this session, we will discuss recent advances in single-cell and spatial profiling, experimental and computational strategies for applying them to examine tumor biology, and emerging approaches to link these features to functional responses. We will also discuss outstanding challenges that need to be addressed to realize the promise of these approaches for transforming precision preventions and cures in cancer and beyond.<\/p>","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"53","Key":"cf1c69ac-e8c5-4bde-8eb3-dccd06989932","LastUpdated":"2023-03-30 23:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W224 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT05","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Bioinformatics \/ Computational Biology \/ Systems Biology \/ Convergent Science","PrimaryCategory_keys":"48d8ff66-f809-4191-ba2b-5f22b0f95ef3","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT05.
