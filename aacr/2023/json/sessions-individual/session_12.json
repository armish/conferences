Public health agencies, academic and research institutions, and others have recognized the need to engage populations that have historically been underrepresented in biomedical research (UBR). However, implementation of this engagement is often superficial, short-term and benefits the researchers more than the community. This session will review models, strategies, and metrics for meaningful and mutually beneficial engagement of UBR populations in cancer research.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 6:30:00 PM","EndTime":"18:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"12","Key":"e438f284-0daf-401e-a014-e35587f12032","LastUpdated":"2023-04-07 13:36","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W311 E-H - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"FO02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Population Sciences","PrimaryCategory_keys":"aac4f922-9142-438f-8cca-8bd13134a497","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"FO02.
