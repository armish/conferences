Yet, tumor resistance to selective KRAS inhibitors has become a significant issue in the clinic (Awad et al., N Engl J Med, 2021; Zhao et al., Nature 2021). To provide experimental information that might help to improve current KRAS targeting strategies, we have compared the therapeutic consequences of eliminating, instead of inhibiting, KRAS oncoproteins from two experimental mouse tumor models of KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, we are developing therapeutic strategies to complement the effect of KRAS inhibitors by tampering with KRAS signaling pathways. We have extended our previous observations showing that combined ablation of RAF1 and EGFR resulted in complete regression of a fraction of KRAS\/P53-driven mouse pancreatic tumors (Blasco et al, Cancer Cell 2019).  We have now identified a third target whose ablation overcomes the resistance of these tumors to RAF1 and EGFR ablation leading to the complete regression of most pancreatic tumors. Finally, I will discuss potential strategies to pharmacologically validate this triple therapeutic strategy as well as plans to combine it with current KRAS inhibitors.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"629","Key":"c2a1e71d-3d35-4c78-986c-ac8d509e4245","LastUpdated":"2023-03-30 23:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W312 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME21","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME21.
