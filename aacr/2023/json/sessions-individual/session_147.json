Many covalently-acting cancer drugs have been approved in recent years against not only kinases, but also more intractable targets such as KRAS G12C. With advances in covalent chemoproteomic strategies as well as using covalency to enable new therapeutic modalities such as targeted protein degradation and beyond, we are only just seeing the tip of the iceberg of what covalent drug discovery can achieve. This session will focus on cutting edge efforts in using covalency to drug the undruggable, discover novel therapeutic targets, expand the scope of targeted protein degradation, and uncover new therapeutic modalities beyond degradation.","Duration":80,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 3:50:00 PM","EndTime":"15:50","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"147","Key":"7eeb954f-76ba-4eba-83f1-4f711ea2ccf1","LastUpdated":"2023-04-14 14:28","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W224 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED048","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Chemistry","PrimaryCategory_keys":"c109d41b-9294-4260-90d6-14ee96687c6c","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED048.
