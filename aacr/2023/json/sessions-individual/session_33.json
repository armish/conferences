Epigenetic control of gene expression is mediated by changes in chromatin with products of metabolism providing substrates for the epigenetic marks on DNA and histones that impact which genes are expressed. In this session, we will cover the latest insights into how changes in metabolism can impact gene expression and how this can influence cancer phenotypes such as initiation, progression and therapeutic sensitivity. The session will also consider how metabolic changes might lead to specificity in cell state changes, and how this information might be leveraged to better target either metabolism or epigenetic regulators for better cancer treatment.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"33","Key":"c59f2c02-d2d2-4b38-b9f8-97c48ab4492e","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 1 (WF1) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY07","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Molecular\/Cellular Biology and Genetics","PrimaryCategory_keys":"adb9ab13-bf74-46ef-b90d-2033fedb560c","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY07.
