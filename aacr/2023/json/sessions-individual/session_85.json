This session will provide a succinct overview of recent translational and clinical research insights into SCLC biology. This will include an overview of the SCLC transcriptomic subtypes and of the phenomenon of plasticity driving subtype intercoversion, including adenocarcinoma-to-neuroendocrine carcinoma transformation, molecular drivers, potential clinical implications and therapeutic opportunities for exploiting lineage plasticity and its contribution to unique subtypes of SCLC. Systematic variability in SCLC tumor gene expression profile has been recently identified and may explain variable therapeutic efficacy and emergence of treatment resistance. Murine models provide a key opportunity to develop methods to practically measure and target SCLC transcriptional programs. This session will highlight recent efforts to develop new therapeutic and diagnostic approaches focused on transcriptional heterogeneity and their translation to clinical trials.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"85","Key":"97bf700a-9ee2-4130-b70b-337e34290221","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W311 A-D - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AOS10","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Research Excluding Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"3b5a3215-acba-4a28-ad12-c29462d32f97","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AOS10.
