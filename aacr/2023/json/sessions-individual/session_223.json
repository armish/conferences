Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), an advanced form of prostate cancer, has particularly dismal outcomes and limited treatment options. However, a growing pathophysiological understanding of disease, coupled with robust drug development over the last decade, have led to recent drug approvals that are rapidly revolutionizing the treatment paradigm for mCRPC. This symposium will review emerging research in mCRPC, with a focus on the role of prostate cancer signaling pathways and how they relate to current therapeutic trends and new therapeutic targets.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/16\/2023 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"223","Key":"07597e72-74c8-4229-8138-f1d486aeb941","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater A","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>Pfizer<\/p>\u000d\u000a","Number":"ESP01A","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ESP01A.
