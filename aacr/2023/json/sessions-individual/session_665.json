An ongoing tumor specific response must be active for modulating agents such as PD-1 blockade to be successful.   Although responses to neoantigens are currently attractive targets for therapy, other targets and responding populations exist and data supporting these populations will be presented.  In addition, the regulation of anti-tumor responses will also be discussed, focusing on innate lymphoid cells from the tumor microenvironment and their inhibitory capacity.  These two components, target antigens and immunoregulation are key hurdles where more insights are needed for improving immunotherapies.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"665","Key":"2c2541b1-4a71-4b75-ad13-276cd9d2ff31","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Chapin Theater - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME14","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Immunology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"bd4b7f63-21dc-4421-a11e-628f36cc56fe","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME14.
