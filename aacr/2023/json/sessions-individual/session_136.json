Over the past several years the numbers of degrader compounds entering the clinic has grown exponentially.  These targeted therapies have the potential to impact lives of numerous cancer patients by having increased efficacy as compared to existing treatments, activity in resistant populations, or being able to remove disease drivers not otherwise approachable by conventional inhibition.  In this educational session we will highlight the history of heterobifunctional degraders\/PROTACs and molecular glues, how to discover and develop them, their impact in oncology, and the future of the broader induced proximity field.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"136","Key":"f781edac-5406-4d23-be56-a03665cebda7","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Valencia A - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED039","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Chemistry","PrimaryCategory_keys":"c109d41b-9294-4260-90d6-14ee96687c6c","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED039.
