In this symposium we will first review the genomic wiring of response and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade and discuss how we can leverage the lessons learned to overcome resistance. We will then focus on targeting replication stress, which represents a key cancer vulnerability that can be therapeutically leveraged to induce cancer cell lethality as well as to enhance anti-tumor immune responses. To this end, inhibition of polymerase theta (POL?) may prevent or reverse acquired resistance to PARP inhibition. Bridging these findings to the clinic, we will discuss the multifactorial nature of resistance to PARP inhibitors and efforts to translate to rational drug combinations in clinical trials that target and reverse resistance to PARP inhibitors.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"38","Key":"b7c22de7-c00e-414f-8955-e7776e74ffd8","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Valencia A - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY32","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Research Excluding Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"3b5a3215-acba-4a28-ad12-c29462d32f97","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY32.
