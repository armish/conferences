However, challenges remain that limit our ability to fully leverage these scientific findings and technological feats in clinical practice. Here we will cover liquid biopsy cell-free DNA analysis, and focus on features that enable precise quantitation, detection, and tumor tissue of origin inference. We will also discuss cell-free DNA mutational characteristics, genomic alterations, epigenomics and fragmentomics, applications to both adult and pediatric malignancies, biofluids beyond blood plasma for cell-free DNA extraction and analysis, and parallels between the circulating tumor DNA and non-invasive prenatal cell-free DNA fields. Finally, we will discuss exciting opportunities, while keeping in mind technical challenges, for clinical translation of modern cell-free DNA science and technology for cancer.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"22","Key":"586dd8c3-c11f-4963-ae7d-7c74bffc64bd","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Valencia A - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY27","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Prevention \/ Early Detection \/ Interception","PrimaryCategory_keys":"fe4903b1-5af5-4508-908c-2e0994986a26","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY27.
