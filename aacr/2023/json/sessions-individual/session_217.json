Generalizability of these trials' findings to a U.S. population are further impacted by a lack of a coordinated global multiregional approach. Such drug development programs pose several regulatory challenges that may result in adverse regulatory decisions by FDA, and can possibly delay patients' access to otherwise promising drugs. This session will examine: regional trends in clinical trial patient enrolment in pivotal trials and supporting marketing applications submitted to FDA for indications in lung and gastrointestinal malignancies; emerging challenges with clinical trial patient enrolment in the United States; and FDA Oncology Center of Excellence&rsquo;s coordinated initiatives to improve diversity of clinical trial patient populations across clinical drug development programs.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"217","Key":"8d1ff61a-1059-47a5-a856-e8f3aadb1073","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W315 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DC12","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Regulatory Science and Policy","PrimaryCategory_keys":"b441e0de-a219-40b6-975f-b6340977f0c0","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"DC12.
