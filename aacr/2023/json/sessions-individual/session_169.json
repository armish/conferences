This has the potential to identify new vulnerabilities that can be exploited therapeutically – so called ‘Achilles Heels’ – by linking new targets, pathways, and cellular mechanisms with disease biology. This educational session will survey the use of phenotypic screening for cancer drug discovery through reflecting on previous experiences and charting future opportunities. The presentations will cover the distinctive applications of phenotypic screening and compare these with conventional target-centric drug discovery approaches. We will discuss how new opportunities such as in-depth mechanistic profiling, including image-based cell painting, and machine learning\/AI are advancing modern phenotypic screens. Additionally, we will discuss how disease-relevant models can be deployed to improve the clinical relevance of screens, and how multi-omics data, functional genetic screens, and CRISPR genetic tools can facilitate target deconvolution and mechanism of action studies.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/14\/2023 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"169","Key":"7eb61b7a-2a6d-495b-9389-c1196e2a2e76","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W224 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED016","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Drug Development","PrimaryCategory_keys":"1b9cdf0a-9d16-4a07-a5ef-2fc8884e0367","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED016.
