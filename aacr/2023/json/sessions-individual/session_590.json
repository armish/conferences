Optical genome mapping (OGM) has emerged as a powerful tool that can be applied widely in this space, due to its unique ability to detect structural variants at high resolution across the entire genome. During this session, presenters will detail the utility of OGM across several cancer therapy development applications, featuring exciting scientific data from new studies. The presentation will include how OGM enables: 1) Comprehensive characterization of structural variants in the genome; 2) Identification and characterization of cancer biomarkers to enable better personalized therapy approaches; 3) Cell line screening and monitoring for genome integrity in cell therapy applications; 4) Characterization of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) across breast tumor samples and stratification of cases based on HRD status; 5) Structural variant detection involving TP53 and its relevance in clinical trials.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"590","Key":"2e6c46ee-b47a-40f7-818a-94c54feaa304","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater E","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>Bionano<\/p>\u000a","Number":"ESP05E","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ESP05E.
