Root causes for these disparities stem from structural and social determinants of health (SDOH). Examples of equity approaches grounded in SDOH in cancer control will be presented: 1) The CDC Cancer Prevention and Control Research Network conducted a multi-phase, consensus-building process to identify core principles, rooted in participatory, SDOH, and racial justice frameworks, to advance equity. 2) The New York City (NYC) CONNECT program utilized participatory and trauma-informed approaches to advance racial equity strategies and improve cancer screening outcomes in diverse, low-income neighborhoods in NYC. 3) Vaccine Acceptance in Immigrant Youth and Adolescents (VAIYA) Initiative engaged in participatory and qualitative research with Arab and Mexican American parents, teenagers and community leaders in NYC to reduce cervical cancer disparities, understand contextual and SDOH factors underlying HPV vaccine hesitancy, and co-create a culturally-tailored health communications campaign with community members.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"679","Key":"dddc6ba2-f63e-4c00-b1a8-572f9f3581cc","LastUpdated":"2023-04-13 16:05","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W314 A - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME35","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME35.
