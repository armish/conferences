Many patients with otherwise refractory disease achieve deep and durable responses, and CART cells are now being tested earlier in the treatment paradigm in some hematologic malignancies. While this treatment platform has been resoundingly validated in some blood cancers, proof-of-concept that CAR-based therapy can be useful in the treatment of solid tumors remains scant, but NOT absent. Indeed, a growing number of clinical reports show convincing responses in solid tumor patients treated with autologous CART cells. In the session titled “Which CAR to drive”, experts will outline recent clinical successes, describe current and incipient efforts to improve upon the platform and discuss which CAR might be best employed in a particular clinical setting.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 6:30:00 PM","EndTime":"18:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"17","Key":"07c458a2-307e-4740-983e-14050166f7b2","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Chapin Theater - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"FO07","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Research Excluding Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"3b5a3215-acba-4a28-ad12-c29462d32f97","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"FO07.
