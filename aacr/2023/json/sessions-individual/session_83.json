First the role of social and environmental risk factors in development of aggressive treatment resistant cancers and their contribution to health disparities will be considered as a setting for the emergence of agressive hard to treat cancers.&nbsp; Next the session will address recent discoveries relating to genomic and epigenetic mechanisms underpinning resistant or persistent fitness phenotypes. Finally current issues and mechanisms in resistance emerging from targeted therapies for ER+ breast cancers will be discussed in light of emerging clinical data.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"83","Key":"ee2c5a84-394f-4881-be79-7d916932d533","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W224 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AOS08","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Research Excluding Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"3b5a3215-acba-4a28-ad12-c29462d32f97","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AOS08.
