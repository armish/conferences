To analyze petabytes of CRDC data without the burden of downloading, NCI’s Cloud Resources (CRs) bring data together with on-demand computational analysis tools and workflows in secure, collaborative cloud workspaces.One of the three NCI Cloud Resources, Seven Bridges’ Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC), provides a unified cancer data analysis platform by co-localizing three components: 1) large cancer datasets including ‘omics, imaging, and others; 2) >600 bioinformatics tools and optimized workflows for analyzing multi-omics data; and 3) the computational capabilities to do large-scale analyses. Through CGC’s user-friendly portal, researchers can browse, query, and filter data sets of interest, analyze their own data alongside publicly available data, upload privately developed tools, and complete reproducible and interactive analyses. Furthermore, researchers can use Jupyter notebooks or RStudio with the CGC Data Cruncher and share results easily without data download.OmicCircos is an R software package used to generate high-quality circular plots for visualizing genomic variations, including mutation patterns, copy number variations (CNVs), expression patterns, and methylation patterns. Such variations can be displayed as scatterplot, line, or text-label figures. Relationships among genomic features in different chromosome positions can be represented in the forms of polygons or curves. Utilizing the statistical and graphic functions in an R\/Bioconductor environment, OmicCircos performs statistical analyses and displays results using cluster, boxplot, histogram, and heatmap formats. In addition, OmicCircos offers a number of unique capabilities, including independent track drawing for easy modification and integration, zoom functions, link-polygons, and position-independent heatmaps supporting detailed visualization.In this session we will introduce the CRDC and demonstrate a new implementation of OmicCircos into the CRDC’s Seven Bridges’ Cancer Genomics Cloud. Using OmicCircos the bench biologist will be able to visualize datasets from across the CRDC, as well as their own data. During the session we will demonstrate how to access the data in the CRDC, upload your own data, and visualize various genomic information including copy number variation, gene expression data, and mutations all utilizing OmicCircos.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 5:00:00 PM","EndTime":"17:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"773","Key":"5aefdfb9-451b-448f-961f-758f6963224d","LastUpdated":"2023-03-30 23:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W314 A - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"NIH02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"NIH02.
