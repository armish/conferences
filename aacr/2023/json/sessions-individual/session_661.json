Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is critical to DNA replication and repair processes and it is also a proliferation biomarker in a variety of human tumors. A unique cancer-associated isoform of the protein, caPCNA, has been previously identified that potentially allows for selective therapeutic targeting of cancer cells. Several strategies have been employed to develop agents targeting caPCNA, including peptide and small molecule-based inhibitors, but the success in developing therapeutically tractable compounds has been limited. Here, we present a novel small molecule-based caPCNA inhibitor, AOH1996. We describe the action of AOH1996, which has recently entered phase one clinical trial. Findings suggest AOH1996 may provide a new and unique therapeutic avenue for exploiting this cancer-selective vulnerability.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"661","Key":"73edfa2a-2b8a-42df-afcf-acb1f099a80b","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W307 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME11","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME11.
