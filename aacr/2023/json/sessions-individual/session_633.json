While there are a number of positive reasons why we have made great strides in cancer research over the past decade, there are an equal number of theories why progress in certain disease types (besides their aggressive and complicated biologic nature) have been disappointing.  In this discussion, we will focus on the importance of the interplay between clinicians; clinician-scientists; and basic\/translational scientists, in relation to trying to optimize progress in the field of cancer research.  The goal of this conversation is to push the field forward in facilitating: dialogue; collaborations; open-mindedness; diversity; discovery; and most importantly, clinical impact.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"633","Key":"d0221d3e-5fa9-4bc3-9df6-bc729efb5e75","LastUpdated":"2023-03-30 23:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W314 A - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME42","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME42.
