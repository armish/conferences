These seven common characteristics of pancreatic cancer include desmoplastic stroma, chronic inflammation, dysregulated metabolism, undruggable KRAS, early metastasis, rapid deconditioning and diagnostic deficiencies, and posit that these hallmarks are collectively responsible for disease aggressiveness and clinical failure. Finally, we propose a strategic framework to address these challenges and thereby improve patient outcomes.<\/p>","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"680","Key":"a39bcb10-7b6c-4762-8c26-21bead60345b","LastUpdated":"2023-03-30 23:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W315 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME36","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME36.
