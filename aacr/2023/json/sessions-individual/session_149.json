It is therefore not surprising that the tumor microenvironment (TME) is recognized as a central player in cancer risk, onset, and progression.  In order to design means for assertively targeting the TME and harnessing its natural tumor suppressive function, a comprehensive understanding of the ever-changing TME is needed.  This educational session is designed to use pancreatic cancer as an example of a TME avid solid cancer and provide the audience with tools that can broaden our understanding of the TME as it regards to: 1- the establishment and regulation of the TME; 2- the interplay between various TME components; and 3- the role that the TME modulating-unit (i.e., cancer-associated fibroblasts and self-generated extracellular matrix) plays in supporting or deterring tumorigenesis alone or in response to anti-tumor intended interventions.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"149","Key":"ed45018c-68a4-4214-b2fc-aaa93b139612","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 2 (WF2) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED050","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED050.
