Driven by the need to identify the appropriate molecular targets, monitoring disease progression and determining the patient specific therapeutic response, swift technological advances are enabling liquid biopsy as never before. The potential clinical applications of liquid biopsy are vast and includes screening, detection of minimal residual disease and\/or early relapse after curative intent treatment, monitoring response to therapy, identifying molecular targets for treatment, and identification of resistance mechanisms while on treatment. The cardinal pre-requisite for effectiveness of precision treatment is the ability to pinpoint the underlying genomic aberrations that make tumors susceptible along with the emerging resistance genomic alterations. Recognizing this, there has been a monumental advance in next generation of liquid biopsy tools. This session focusses on bringing not only the state of the art, but what is on the horizon of Liquid Biopsy field.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/19\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"58","Key":"c20f177d-b0ae-4461-887b-5581d5a4d4bf","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W414 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT09","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Bioinformatics \/ Computational Biology \/ Systems Biology \/ Convergent Science","PrimaryCategory_keys":"48d8ff66-f809-4191-ba2b-5f22b0f95ef3","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT09.
