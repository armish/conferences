In 2022 alone is estimated that just in the United States, 1.9M may be diagnosed with a form of cancer with only approximately 53% survival (1). Cancer therapeutics have recently evolved away from radiation and chemo therapy, utilizing more the power of biologics to treat the disease. Several new methodologies have proven effective for treating cancer: cytokine treatments, antibody therapeutics, gene therapy, and cell therapy. In addition, several vaccine companies have incorporated newly modernized mRNA technology into their cancer vaccine strategies. GenScript offers a comprehensive portfolio of advanced tools to support cancer research and therapeutic development. We have a wide range of offerings, such as off-the-shelf cancer-related antibodies, proteins, and stable cell lines, along with many general research tools such as gene synthesis, gene editing, custom protein and antibody production, and automated systems for western blotting, protein and plasmid purification, and cell isolation.<\/p>","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 1:30:00 PM","EndTime":"13:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"584","Key":"c5440458-9cb6-4336-b943-fa5e4b8a923d","LastUpdated":"2023-03-30 23:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater D","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>GenScript<\/p>\u000a","Number":"ESP04D","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ESP04D.
