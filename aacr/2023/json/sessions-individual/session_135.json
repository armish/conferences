Many products are under development for both single and multi-cancer detection. Established concepts of diagnostic performance and historically narrow approaches for screening test evaluation should be reconsidered in this new era of rapid discovery. Alternative approaches for the development and evaluation of these new tools can optimize implementation in a rapidly evolving landscape. In this session we will examine the evidence needed to realize the promise of new cancer screening technologies. We will zero in on what we need to know before we can make concrete recommendations about the use of these tests for population screening and discuss the potential obstacles to ensuring that all persons will benefit from the new tests.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/14\/2023 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"135","Key":"5b447538-b336-41c8-9315-81c938485b91","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W312 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED038","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Prevention \/ Early Detection \/ Interception","PrimaryCategory_keys":"fe4903b1-5af5-4508-908c-2e0994986a26","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED038.
