This session includes talks reviewing the primary pillars of cancer survivorship as defined by the Institute of Medicine, and the way that Survivorship Programs address these through clinical excellence and research initiatives that target the underlying biologic causes of treatment-related complications.  In addition the session includes a deep dive into the effects of treatment on bone and muscle, with an exploration of the basic mechanisms that can contribute to muscle fatigue, bone loss, and frailty.  Finally the session will investigate the mechanisms of cardiac complications associated with cancer treatment, and approaches to mitigating these toxicities.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"41","Key":"a25185e1-485b-43d3-8f43-0cae76bc5019","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W312 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY35","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Survivorship","PrimaryCategory_keys":"d4420fd5-7e0d-47e8-ab1c-0e3b22287219","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY35.
