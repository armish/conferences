They are difficult to diagnose and treat, with 38-48% mortality for this often young age group. To improve diagnosis and treatment, there are several challenges: 1) There are >70 histological subtypes, and due to their rarity they are difficult for pathologists to diagnose. 2) Subtypes differ with regards to their immune micro-environment and their response to therapy, including immunotherapy. Predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy in sarcoma are lacking. 3) Representative model systems for sarcoma are scarce. Preclinical in vitro models for drug testing, including cell lines and 3D culture models, are difficult to generate and are available only for the more common sarcoma subtypes. In this session we will discuss where we currently stand in addressing these three challenges in sarcoma translational research.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"77","Key":"cdcfcf05-b4ae-4592-a1d4-5b0e721e599a","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W312 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AOS02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Research Excluding Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"3b5a3215-acba-4a28-ad12-c29462d32f97","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AOS02.
