TLS may be immature composed of T and B cell aggregates, or mature containing a germinal center (GC) in the B cell zone. In T cell areas, mature dendritic cells can present antigens, including tumor-originating peptides, to T cells, initiating or activating T cell responses. In GCs, B cells are activated through antigen presentation on follicular dendritic cells (FDC) and signals from T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, resulting in the generation of antibody producing plasma cells. Immature TLS do not support response to immunotherapy but mature TLS in tumor beds or their invasive margin are associated with responses to immunotherapy and longer patientâ€™s survival. The session will discuss the various types of TLS in cancers a well as the roles of T cells and antibodies generated in situ in anti-tumor immunity.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"157","Key":"c8339b2f-3cad-4591-bdc5-6b9e0fcd8f97","LastUpdated":"2023-03-27 14:08","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W311 E-H - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED006","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED006.
