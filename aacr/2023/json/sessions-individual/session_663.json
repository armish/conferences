The Morrison laboratory has identified and characterized the niche for hematopoietic stem cell in the bone marrow, including the Leptin Receptor+ stromal cells that are the main source of many growth factors that regulate hematopoiesis and osteogenesis. They are in the process of testing whether elements of the bone marrow microenvironment that regulate stem cell function also regulate the formation and growth of metastasis in bone\/bone marrow.<\/p>","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"663","Key":"0c523750-3b5d-4c99-93db-561bdf0c44b1","LastUpdated":"2023-03-30 23:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 3-4 (WF3-4) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME49","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME49.
