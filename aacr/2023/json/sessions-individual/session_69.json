Patients with cancer often develop lean body mass and fat loss, loss of appetite, sustained inflammation, and neuroendocrinological changes. This can lead to cancer-associated cachexia, a wasting syndrome with very poor prognosis. We will provide an overview of tumor-released and associated factors that drive cachexia. In addition, we will present data on the longitudinal whole-body effects of cancer from early disease to cachexia. Dr. Talbert will focus on the dysregulation of muscle homeostasis, Drs. White and Pitarresi on the altered metabolism driven by the inflammatory molecules, and Dr. Janowitz on the effect of tumor-released factors on the brain and the hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal axis. Mechanistic work in murine model systems of lung, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer will be complimented by correlative findings in patients with these cancers. Emerging therapeutic strategies that target the host organism will be discussed.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/19\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"69","Key":"c584acad-6499-4d3b-9554-e8eadde89ffe","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 1 (WF1) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY20","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Survivorship","PrimaryCategory_keys":"d4420fd5-7e0d-47e8-ab1c-0e3b22287219","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY20.
