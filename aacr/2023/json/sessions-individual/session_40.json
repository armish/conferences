Being at the interface of preclinical and clinical development, phase I trials provide the opportunity to assess pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, develop and incorporate biomarkers, and evaluate patient enrichment strategies that can better inform further drug development. In this session we will discuss the changes in objectives and design of phase I trials and how these can be utilized to accelerate development of promising agents.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"40","Key":"977c86cf-8efa-4611-9fdc-921d9a0ff241","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W311 E-H - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY34","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"4668ebd3-0460-4c09-a084-82a9f9fccb0f","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY34.
