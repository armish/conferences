All components of the tumor microenvironment are actively engaged as tumors remodel the tissue barriers that normally balance cellular growth and death, and restrict cellular migration. This session will discuss how diverse players in the tumor microenvironment (e.g. myeloid cells, vasculature, stroma) support tumor progression, the impact of aging, and strategies to therapeutically re-direct and normalize the microenvironment. The presentations will describe the interconnectedness of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell function in the tumor microenvironment, their co-evolution with malignant cells, and thereby their functional impact on tumor progression.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"66","Key":"4bd4187c-d19f-4cac-841f-37421e0a7d9e","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Valencia D - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY17","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY17.
