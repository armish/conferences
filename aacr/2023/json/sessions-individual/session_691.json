We will then embark on an in depth discussion of our strategies to cure every child with minimal toxicity based on new data identifying additional genomic determinants of outcome through the Moonshot initiative, as well as the development of innovative algorithms that will allow further optimization of risk stratification. This approach enhances the capacity of currently utilized categorical variables (presenting white blood cell count, levels of minimal residual disease, etc.) by using them as continuous variables that integrate them into a risk classification algorithm capable of improving the discrimination between those who will remain in complete clinical remission versus those who will relapse.&nbsp;","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/19\/2023 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"691","Key":"f579342c-d7e9-4501-a1c4-47ba96b3cbd1","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W230 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME47","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME47.
