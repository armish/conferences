In this session, we&rsquo;ll explore how these technical benefits open up a new window of understanding into cancer genomes, featuring projects ranging from cancer whole-genome sequencing to cell-free DNA with methylation, and single-cell sequencing. Join us to hear the latest from scientists using nanopore sequencing to access new genomic and transcriptomic information, giving an unprecedented view of the mechanisms involved in cancer progression and evolution.<\/p>","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 1:30:00 PM","EndTime":"13:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"598","Key":"39062ea2-0731-4c7f-addb-ab09703caefe","LastUpdated":"2023-03-30 23:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater C","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>Oxford Nanopore Technology<\/p>\u000a","Number":"ESP07C","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ESP07C.
