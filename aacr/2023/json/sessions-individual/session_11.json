Emerging methods yield omics measurements at resolutions covering the nano- to microscale, enabling the charting of cellular architecture, cell heterogeneity, complex tissue topology and dynamic changes during cancer development. In this session, we will showcase examples of emerging concepts and technologies in the rapidly developing landscape of in situ spatial genome, transcriptome and proteome technologies, and exemplify their impact on cell biology and cancer research.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"11","Key":"2b54d098-3ac7-4ebb-ab60-b3cd00d87010","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Valencia D - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY26","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY26.
