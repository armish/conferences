Nearly four decades ago, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was identified as a critical factor promoting vascular permeability and angiogenesis. Since 2004, over a dozen drugs targeting the VEGF\/VEGFR pathway have been approved for 20 types of solid tumors, used alone or in combination with other therapies. Initially designed to starve tumors, preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that these agents can transiently “normalize” tumor vessels and improve concurrent therapies. Unfortunately, the survival benefit in unselected patient populations has been modest, and there are currently no approved predictive biomarkers. However, the ability of these agents to reprogram the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment into an immunostimulatory milieu has rekindled interest in antiangiogenesis and led to the FDA-approval of 7 different combinations of VEGF\/VEGFR pathway inhibitors with immune checkpoint blockers for 4 types of solid tumors in the past 4 years. Although such combinations have failed in some malignancies (e.g., glioblastoma), they remain of great interest, as evidenced by more than 300 ongoing clinical trials in multiple malignancies. In this Forum, we discuss our current understanding of the mechanisms of benefit as well as future opportunities and challenges in combining anti-VEGF\/VEGFR agents with immunotherapies (e.g., immune-checkpoint blockers, cell-based therapies, vaccines).","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 6:30:00 PM","EndTime":"18:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"18","Key":"436f6e01-1c93-4727-8111-f6d983c27556","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 1 (WF1) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"FO08","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Research Excluding Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"3b5a3215-acba-4a28-ad12-c29462d32f97","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"FO08.
