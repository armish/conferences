However, many are unfamiliar with the product labels, what information is contained in them, and how to use them. Project Livin&rsquo; Label is a new educational initiative that aims to foster broad understanding of the associated oncology product label and increase awareness of recent oncology drug FDA approvals in the cancer community. Using oncology product labeling as a road map, the FDA&rsquo;s Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE) will guide discussions between an FDA reviewer, a clinical trial investigator, a patient, and the company on the backstory of the oncology product development and FDA review process. Join us for this session on the approval of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (Enhertu) for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+\/ISH-) breast cancer who have received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy.<\/p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"211","Key":"ec85e2f6-8796-4d1e-ac95-391880ebad67","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W315 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DC06","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Regulatory Science and Policy","PrimaryCategory_keys":"b441e0de-a219-40b6-975f-b6340977f0c0","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"DC06.
