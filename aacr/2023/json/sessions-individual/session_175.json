Data have shown that tumor draining lymph nodes are critical for the maintenance of anti-cancer immune responses and the efficacy of immunotherapy. Further, lymph node metastases are one of the strongest predictors of disease outcome. A patient with lymph node metastases has a worse prognosis than an otherwise equal patient without lymph node metastasis. However, recent clinical trials have called into question the clinical utility of removing lymph nodes in early-stage cancer patients. In this session, we will discuss the role lymph node metastasis can play in disease progression and the communication that occurs between the primary cancer and lymph nodes. The presentations will provoke a discussion around the balance between preventing distant dissemination and maintaining the ability to generate anti-cancer immune responses.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"175","Key":"880f8262-ad79-44e6-803e-e15467e6aa52","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W311 E-H - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED027","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Immunology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"bd4b7f63-21dc-4421-a11e-628f36cc56fe","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED027.
