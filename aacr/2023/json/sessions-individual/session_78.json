We will review existing and emerging oncogenic drivers, with a special emphasis on KRAS-mutant lung cancer given the explosion of data in this field. We will discuss emerging concepts related to lineage plasticity and drug tolerance, as they pertain to drug response. We will highlight potential implications for how cellular identity and cell state, as assessed by cutting edge single cell techniques, may inform therapeutic paradigms.<\/p>\u000a\u000a<p>Dharma Master Jiantai, for whom this Session is named, was a brave young Abbess who dedicated her life to dharma teaching. She was a never-smoker who was diagnosed with lung cancer. Although not available to her at the time, targeted treatments are now available for the mutation that was identified in Dharma Master Jiantai&rsquo;s cancer. According to her wishes and in memory of Dharma Master Jiantai, her family established an endowment to support the Dharma Master Jiantai Advances in Lung Cancer Research Session, Dharma Master Jiantai Symposium in Targeted Therapy, and Dharma Master Jiantai Advances in Biomarkers Session. The family&rsquo;s goal is to foster cancer research that leads to new drug development, so that patients with cancer will live longer, have better quality of life, and potentially reach a cure in select cases.<\/p>\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/19\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"78","Key":"aede636c-3c62-41a5-9ab1-337b2dc1b468","LastUpdated":"2023-03-31 17:03","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Valencia BC - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AOS03","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Research Excluding Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"3b5a3215-acba-4a28-ad12-c29462d32f97","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AOS03.
