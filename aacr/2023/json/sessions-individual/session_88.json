This prompted professional societies to advice prioritization of patients with cancer for vaccination. In this session we will describe how humoral and cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccines evolve over time and how immune memory is developed. We will address difference between vaccines. Cancer treatment can affect the ability to mount an effective immune response.&nbsp; Also type of cancer is of importance, demonstrated by a clear difference in immune response to vaccination between patients with solid tumors and patients with blood cancers. We will discuss the results of COVID vaccination studies in patients with cancer and real-world data on the risk and outcome&nbsp; of breakthrough infections. Risk factors for breakthrough infections will be addressed. Detailed understanding the immune response, memory and efficacy of vaccination could be used to develop future vaccination strategies for patients with cancer, not only for infectious diseases but also for cancer vaccines.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/16\/2023 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"88","Key":"8a2fa96b-28f6-43c9-a8ba-c773ad5b5410","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W311 E-H - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"APS01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"COVID-19 and Cancer","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f3be3e23-b8d8-40fb-ae1c-2484b885c78d","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"APS01.
