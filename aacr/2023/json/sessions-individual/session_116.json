These tools are widely used and highly accessible to any scientist: they are all web-based and have rich graphical user interfaces. The tools to be presented in this session are: (1) the Galaxy platform (https:\/\/galaxyproject.org\/), a computational workbench with thousands of tools for performing bulk and single-cell omics analyses, image processing, machine learning, and many more kinds of biomedical analyses; (2) the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (https:\/\/www.cbioportal.org\/), which provides visualization, analysis, and download of large-scale cancer genomics data sets; and (3) the Xena Functional Genomics Explorer (https:\/\/xenabrowser.net\/), a web application that enables users to explore functional genomic data sets for correlations between genomic and\/or phenotypic variables.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"116","Key":"fc60fb40-f8f9-4b6d-8e1e-b243f4a3596e","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W224 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW005","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Bioinformatics \/ Computational Biology \/ Systems Biology \/ Convergent Science","PrimaryCategory_keys":"48d8ff66-f809-4191-ba2b-5f22b0f95ef3","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW005.
