Chemically-induced biomolecule proximity, however, presents a considerably broader therapeutic opportunity than protein degradation. Molecular glues mediate protein-protein interactions that neofunctionalize targets yielding diverse biological effects. Heterobifunctional molecules have been designed to hijack an emerging list of enzymes to systematically modulate targets in distinct ways. This educational session will cover this next phase of induced proximity research, and we will discuss the prospects and challenges of these emerging pharmacological modalities for cancer drug discovery.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"137","Key":"284fb9e8-0bb6-47a5-a507-6023de4c0c91","LastUpdated":"2023-04-03 22:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W224 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED040","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Chemistry","PrimaryCategory_keys":"c109d41b-9294-4260-90d6-14ee96687c6c","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED040.
