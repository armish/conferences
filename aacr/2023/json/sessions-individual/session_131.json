However, to profile the transcriptome of tumor cells, researchers first need to obtain a single-cell suspension. In doing so, researchers sadly lose one of the most essential aspects of biology: the spatial context of cells. To fully understand how cells communicate in cancer, we need not only a precise idea of gene and protein expression per cell type, but also detailed information on their position in relation to other cells and structures that make up the tumor. The next frontier in single-cell cancer biology is therefore to finally resolve the precise spatial location of each single cell, so that we can finally understand the tissue architecture for each tumor and identify the local cell-cell circuits that control the functional specialization of cells per neighborhood. In this session we will discuss: (i) approaches to generate a spatial atlas of each tumor, (ii) approaches to integrate single-cell transcriptomics data with spatial data and study cell-cell interactions in each cellular neighborhood, (iii) case studies in which the effect of immunotherapies on the immune responses within the tumor are studied in their spatial context.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"131","Key":"c12adce2-a00f-4666-bdf6-9e04ddd3dafb","LastUpdated":"2023-03-30 23:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Chapin Theater - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW013","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Immunology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"bd4b7f63-21dc-4421-a11e-628f36cc56fe","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW013.
