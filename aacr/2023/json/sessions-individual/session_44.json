Post-translational modifications of these building-blocks, and the factors that regulate these events, play essential roles in maintaining the integrity of cells, tissues, and ultimately whole organisms. Chromatin and epigenetic regulators are broadly altered in human cancers. This session will explore how chromatin adaptors like Menin help decode chromatin post-translational modifications and how they regulate gene expression in cancer. In addition, cancers are characterized by loss of epigenetic silencing and subsequent expression of transposable elements, which make up half of our genome. This loss of epigenetic silencing can further be perturbed by therapies that target epigenetic regulators. We will describe how different epigenetic modifications regulate transposable elements and the resulting immune response in solid tumors. Lastly, despite impressive preclinical data, translation of epigenetic therapies to the treatment of human solid tumors remains elusive. We will focus on current challenges confronting the use of epigenetic agents in patients with thoracic malignancies and introduce potential strategies to overcome these obstacles which are being explored in ongoing clinical trials.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/19\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"44","Key":"68d366ca-180c-4fa4-842b-b4fa4bfe339d","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Valencia D - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Research Excluding Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"3b5a3215-acba-4a28-ad12-c29462d32f97","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT02.
