However, due to the need to expedite therapies to treat cancer and the larger trials and longer follow-up required for measurement of OS, regulatory and clinical decisions may be based on earlier endpoints. Even when FDA approval is granted based on an earlier endpoint, assessment of OS is critically important. This session will review the importance of OS in assessing benefit-risk and focus on lessons learned from the PARP inhibitors and PI3K inhibitors.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"214","Key":"4879064a-0817-49a4-b3b8-f6c56586b599","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W315 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DC09","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Regulatory Science and Policy","PrimaryCategory_keys":"b441e0de-a219-40b6-975f-b6340977f0c0","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"DC09.
