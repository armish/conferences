This can be achieved via Adaptive Interventions, which explicitly guide how to modify the type\/intensity of services based on information about the individual. Furthermore, advances in digital technologies, such as mobile devices and wearable sensors, have created unprecedented opportunities to deliver just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) which leverage information about the person’s state and context to adapt intervention delivery in real-time, real-world settings.  This educational session will provide an accessible introduction to recent methodological advances for optimizing adaptive interventions and JITAIs. We will begin by introducing two experimental approaches that can be used to empirically-inform the development of adaptive interventions and JITAIs: the Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) and the Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT). We will then discuss a novel application of the SMART with community health centers serving low socioeconomic status populations. The goal is to develop an adaptive intervention that employs technology-based strategies for increasing the reach and impact of evidence-based tobacco cessation treatment. Next, we will discuss a novel application of the MRT using digital sensing to detect stress in real time among smokers attempting to quit. The goal is to develop a JITAI for improving stress-regulation and preventing smoking relapse. Throughout, we will discuss additional innovations and future directions in the development and applications of new methods for optimizing adaptive interventions.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"177","Key":"c79c23ae-2afc-48e7-adb4-316ec635d9c9","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W312 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED025","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Prevention \/ Early Detection \/ Interception","PrimaryCategory_keys":"fe4903b1-5af5-4508-908c-2e0994986a26","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED025.
