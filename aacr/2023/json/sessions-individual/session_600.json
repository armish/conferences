However, the limited availability of ionizable lipids, a major constituent of LNPs, is a barrier to adoption. Herein, we describe a library of ionizable lipids that can be used as functional excipients for nucleic acid delivery for different routes of administration in vivo as well as ex vivo. Furthermore, to exemplify the benefits of LNPs in the production of cell-based cancer therapies, we demonstrate a robust method for the multi-step engineering of gene-edited CAR T cells.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 1:30:00 PM","EndTime":"13:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"600","Key":"b4dbb50d-9ffb-47da-b148-7c9288ce4b29","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater E","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>Precision Nanosystems<\/p>\u000a","Number":"ESP07E","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ESP07E.
