This plenary session will start with novel insights into carcinogenesis and prevention from normal tissue, moving on to the early molecular stages of cancer and their clinical implications. We will then look at the complexity of early cancer at level of society and the need for equitable access to testing to reach the goals of the cancer moonshot. Our fourth talk will address the need for large scale forecasting models of cancer evolution. We will complete the session with the critical component of engagement in early detection of cancer as a key to both impacting on patient outcomes and understanding early cancer evolution.","Duration":120,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 10:00:00 AM","EndTime":"10:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"4","Key":"9dd8bd6f-d5a3-44fa-ae83-1be11066f832","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"W Hall A2-3 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"PL03","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Prevention \/ Early Detection \/ Interception","PrimaryCategory_keys":"fe4903b1-5af5-4508-908c-2e0994986a26","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"PL03.
