However, despite this progress, it remains the case that only a subset of patients benefit from these treatments. Expanding the impact of immune-based treatments for cancer will require an improved understanding of the factors that control anti-tumor immune responses. As a tool for probing these questions, we have adapted well-characterized autochthonous mouse models of cancer to express a series of antigens and have examined the dynamic nature of the immune responses using a range of methods. As an alternative to the expression of model antigens, we have also increased tumor mutational burden through the introduction of mutation in DNA mismatch repair genes. The characterization of these models has led to new insights into the effects of intratumoral heterogeneity on anti-tumor immunity and response to immune checkpoint therapies.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"650","Key":"3d93b1d2-5bca-4747-8780-05a719a62744","LastUpdated":"2023-03-30 23:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Chapin Theater - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME27","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME27.
