The regulation of gene expression across the mammalian genome occurs through multi-tiered complex interactions between non-coding cis-regulatory elements (e.g., enhancers, promoters, and insulators), trans-regulatory factors (e.g., transcription factors), and epigenetic modifications of DNA and histones that constitute the epigenome. More than half of human cancers harbor mutations in genes that encode regulators of the epigenome. Tumor cells frequently utilize epigenetic modifications to escape chemotherapy and host immune surveillance. Epigenetic dysregulation, heterogeneity, and abnormal chromatin interactions have been increasingly recognized as the hallmark of cancer. This session will focus on cutting-edge research revealing the specific and novel epigenetic and chromatin mechanisms that drives cancer initiation and evolution.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"171","Key":"446d0c74-47d8-4cd3-8634-b486d1b8b375","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 2 (WF2) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED018","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Molecular\/Cellular Biology and Genetics","PrimaryCategory_keys":"adb9ab13-bf74-46ef-b90d-2033fedb560c","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED018.
