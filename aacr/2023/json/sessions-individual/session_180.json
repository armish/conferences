While appreciation and understanding of sex differences are advancing, it remains unclear whether sex differences in cancer will be actionable across cancer types for sex-adapted treatments. In this session, we will cover obstacles to the translation of sex differences to clinical oncology and the data that suggest immunotherapy for melanoma is an appropriate setting in which to address these questions. Participants in this session can expect to gain deeper familiarity with the clinical data that indicate there are significant sex differences in immunotherapy responses in patients with melanoma, and with the cell biology underlying the effects of sex hormone signaling on the efficacy of immunotherapy for melanoma.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/14\/2023 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"180","Key":"0a128091-077f-4163-b5c2-d95d68a80c97","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Chapin Theater - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED023","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED023.
