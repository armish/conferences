With an emphasis on quantitative methods, the session will cover: the role of cancer cell plasticity in driving treatment resistance and metastasis; how tumour evolution and ecology impacts outcomes; multicellular single-cell spatial dynamics and immunotherapy response; and circulating biomarkers for real-time monitoring of disease progression. In all, the session will showcase the potential of diverse omic technologies to reveal novel cancer biology and therapeutic opportunities.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"54","Key":"a3e91c1a-27c1-4089-bfe8-abff0546d6ab","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W414 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT06","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Bioinformatics \/ Computational Biology \/ Systems Biology \/ Convergent Science","PrimaryCategory_keys":"48d8ff66-f809-4191-ba2b-5f22b0f95ef3","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT06.
