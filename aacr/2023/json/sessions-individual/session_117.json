This session seeks to educate attendees regarding recent progress in the development of ADCs for oncology applications including the use of both novel cytotoxics, biologically targeted agents, and immuostimulatory agents as payloads.  Challenges associated with these new research directions will be discussed along with potential solutions (e.g., novel conjugation approaches and\/or higher drug-to-antibody loading relative to legacy ADCs).  The application of ADCs to non-oncology indications will also be presented with a focus on utilizing immunosuppressive molecules as payloads.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/14\/2023 6:15:00 PM","EndTime":"18:15","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"117","Key":"2b3138ec-618e-4d1b-867c-db87fda59c29","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W224 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED001","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Drug Development","PrimaryCategory_keys":"1b9cdf0a-9d16-4a07-a5ef-2fc8884e0367","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED001.
