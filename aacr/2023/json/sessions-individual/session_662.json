It is likely that a significant proportion of other childhood cancers are associated with germline polygenic, epigenetic, gene-gene and gene-environment interactions.  To date, surveillance protocols for early tumor detection have proven effective in several cancer predisposition disordersâ€” demonstrating survival advantage and reduced treatment-related morbidity. However, these protocols pose significant logistical\/scheduling challenges, psychosocial burden on the patient and family, and financial burden on the health care system. Novel approaches to early tumor detection have gained traction in the context of disease monitoring and are being incorporated as secondary study questions in many therapeutic clinical trials. However, these tools have only more recently been studied in the context of cancer predisposition. This session will explore the current and future utility of genetic, epigenetic and functional biomarkers in early tumor detection and targets of pharmacoprevention of cancer in a spectrum of cancer predisposition disorders.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"662","Key":"2571ea01-0e6e-4539-9ad2-6e64c1a5a503","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W315 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME12","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME12.
