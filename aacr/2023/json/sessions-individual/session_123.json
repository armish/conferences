This session highlights the development of three clinically translatable next-generation immunotherapy platforms. First, we highlight the development of cell-based cytokine factories to enable spatial and temporal control over pro-inflammatory cytokine delivery for cancer immunotherapy. Next, we discuss protein engineering approaches to design, synthesize and validate conditionally active immune effector molecules with enhanced therapeutic windows. Finally, we examine new drug delivery approaches to facilitate the targeted activation of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. We conclude with a round table discussion on these approaches and others emerging modalities to improve the therapeutic index for cancer immunotherapy.<\/p>","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"123","Key":"fbf564ea-c418-4ab4-a6b1-cf4bcaea57bf","LastUpdated":"2023-03-30 23:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W414 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW007","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Drug Development","PrimaryCategory_keys":"1b9cdf0a-9d16-4a07-a5ef-2fc8884e0367","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW007.
