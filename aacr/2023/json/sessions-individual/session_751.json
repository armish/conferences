The Continuing Umbrella of Research Experiences (CURE) program supports extramural research training and education experiences for grades 6-12, undergraduate and graduate students, Baccalaureate or Master’s degree holders, postdoctoral fellows, and investigators from groups underrepresented in the biomedical workforce. More than 4,000 underrepresented scholars have been supported by the CURE program, which features funding mechanisms including Diversity and Re-entry Supplements, National Research Service Awards (NRSA, F31), Career Development (K) Awards, Exploratory Grant Awards (R21), and Cancer Research Education Grants (R25). In addition to the extramural funding opportunities, the Intramural CURE (iCURE) program supports mentored research experiences within the NCI Intramural Research Program for undergraduate and graduate students, Baccalaureate or Master’s degree holders, and postdoctoral fellows.  Additionally, this session will present new and established funding opportunities in cancer disparities research, including opportunities advancing basic and translational research, those focused on increasing collaborations, partnerships, and team science, and opportunities promoting research in sexual and gender minorities (SGM). Furthermore, this session will review programs, such as the new Cancer Moonshot Scholars program, that seek to promote diversity in the biomedical, behavioral, clinical, and social sciences workforce. Lastly, speakers will also describe the Early Investigator Advancement Program (EIAP), which was launched in 2021 to facilitate the advancement of scientists from diverse backgrounds to become independent investigators.  Overall, this session will provide an overview of the Center’s mission, share funding opportunities, and provide tips for success. <\/p>","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/16\/2023 12:45:00 PM","EndTime":"12:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"751","Key":"946ede02-acbd-4846-aefd-368f700cd237","LastUpdated":"2023-03-30 23:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W314 A - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"NIH05","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"NIH05.
