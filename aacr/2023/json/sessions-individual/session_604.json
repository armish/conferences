Join NuProbe as we discuss BDA technology and highlight recent applications in oncology research. We will discuss research collaborations utilizing BDA next-generation sequencing panels to detect measurable residual disease in both NPM1+ acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and KMT2A-rearranged AML. We will also introduce a BDA qPCR research assay for detection of microsatellite instability without the need for a matched normal. For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"604","Key":"e4ecade0-82b8-4d65-91fa-1064ef7fbe1f","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater D","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ESP08D","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ESP08D.
