Networking Hubs are an informal night of discussion at themed Hubs that provide attendees an opportunity to speak face-to-face with colleagues and potential collaborators. Junior investigators are especially encouraged to take advantage of this unique opportunity to mingle with respected senior investigators and meet fellow junior investigators with similar research interests. It is our hope that discussions started during the Networking Hubs will be continued throughout the Annual Meeting and beyond.<br \/>\u000d\u000aThis year's Hubs are:<\/p>\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a<ul>\u000d\u000a\u0009<li>Cancercareers - Scientific Careers’ Resource Center<\/li>\u000d\u000a\u0009<li>Digital Technologies for Research and Trials<\/li>\u000d\u000a\u0009<li>Entrepreneurship<\/li>\u000d\u000a\u0009<li>Hematologic Malignancies <\/li>\u000d\u000a\u0009<li>Interception, Early Detection, and Prevention<\/li>\u000d\u000a\u0009<li>Resiliency and Survivorship. <\/li>\u000d\u000a<\/ul>\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a<p>**<strong> Please note: This event is now full. <\/strong><\/p>\u000d\u000a","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/16\/2023 8:00:00 PM","EndTime":"20:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"224","Key":"98061144-d796-4274-a4a5-907dd7e0439a","LastUpdated":"2023-04-13 10:37","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"W Hall E2 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SS02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Career Development","PrimaryCategory_keys":"9539057c-c764-401b-9630-d2eacb4316e0","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SS02.
