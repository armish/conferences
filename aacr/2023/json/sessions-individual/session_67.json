To make further progress, the field now must address three critical questions: 1) the identification and therapeutic targeting of clonally conserved cancer-specific antigens, 2) the phenotypic and functional attributes of effective versus ineffective cell products, and 3) the molecular mechanisms leading to T cell dysfunction within tumors and translatable strategies to overcome these barriers. In this session, three speakers will describe emerging strategies to overcome each of these challenges using TCRs, CARs, and TIL.<\/p>\u000a\u000a<p>Dharma Master Jiantai, for whom this Symposium is named, was a brave young Abbess who dedicated her life to dharma teaching. She was a never-smoker who was diagnosed with lung cancer. Although not available to her at the time, targeted treatments are now available for the mutation that was identified in Dharma Master Jiantai&rsquo;s cancer. According to her wishes and in memory of Dharma Master Jiantai, her family established an endowment to support the Dharma Master Jiantai Advances in Lung Cancer Research Session, Dharma Master Jiantai Symposium in Targeted Therapy, and Dharma Master Jiantai Advances in Biomarkers Session. The family&rsquo;s goal is to foster cancer research that leads to new drug development, so that patients with cancer will live longer, have better quality of life, and potentially reach a cure in select cases.<\/p>\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"67","Key":"079a9aa0-f037-43c9-9158-524690285188","LastUpdated":"2023-03-31 16:54","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 2 (WF2) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY18","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY18.
