Single cell expression analysis has been a potent approach to characterize this heterogeneity and improve the development of predictive models for cancer outcomes. At the same time, recent advances in spatial profiling are enabling valuable integrations of single cell expression profiles with the spatial milieu. In this session, we will summarize recent technology advances in single cell and spatial RNA profiling, computational approaches to analyze each of these data types, and techniques to integrate them. We will also survey resources and tools that will be helpful for investigators interested in developing their capabilities for such approaches in their laboratories.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"142","Key":"3184a6c0-f959-4686-9c21-4832b96430be","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W331 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED045","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Bioinformatics \/ Computational Biology \/ Systems Biology \/ Convergent Science","PrimaryCategory_keys":"48d8ff66-f809-4191-ba2b-5f22b0f95ef3","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED045.
