The first talk will focus on progress in developing more sensitive ctDNA assays, with the aim of developing assays that can detect increasingly lower levels of ctDNA, to reduce false negative detection rates and increase lead time from detection to relapse. The session will look at exemplars of how ctDNA testing is being implemented into clinical trials, in patients with head and neck cancers, and breast cancer, and also review how tracking cancers through the molecular relapse setting can allow the study of clonal evolution through this setting.<\/p>","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"128","Key":"328e1f62-6f7f-40f7-9e7a-f58efc8e0847","LastUpdated":"2023-03-30 23:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W224 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW010","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Research Excluding Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"3b5a3215-acba-4a28-ad12-c29462d32f97","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW010.
