It is known that the individual patient response to radiation is influenced by both tumor intrinsic and tumor extrinsic factors. In this session, we will discuss how specific features of the tumor microenvironment can modulate tumor oxygenation and certain metabolic pathways within the tumor cells, leading to radiation resistance; or in reverse, how intrinsic activation of a certain pathway in tumor cells can modulate the tumor and distant microenvironments, leading to therapeutic resistance and distant metastasis. By targeting these pathways, as well as the DNA damage response (DDR), within the tumor, we&nbsp; can develop novel therapies to enhance the efficacy of radiation therapy in solid cancer at the individual level. We will also discuss how these emerging opportunities can help to address the existing challenge of predicting therapeutic responses.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"27","Key":"54f976d5-964c-45d6-b1b4-7d588d5704e5","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W304 A-D - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY31","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Chemistry","PrimaryCategory_keys":"c109d41b-9294-4260-90d6-14ee96687c6c","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY31.
