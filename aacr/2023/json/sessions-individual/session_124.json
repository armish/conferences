An unfortunately frequent side-effect of cancer treatment is enduring neurological impairment, including chemotherapy-induced neuropathy (CIPN) and chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI; “chemobrain”). CIPN is characterized by numbness and tingling, burning pain, gait difficulties and distal weakness, whereas persistent deficits in attention, concentration, memory, and information processing speed are hallmarks of CRCI. As the population of cancer survivors with CIPN and CRCI is growing, there is an urgent need for enhanced expertise from health care professionals. This session will (i) summarize clinical aspects of CIPN and CRCI, including incidence and disease burden, current diagnostics and novel biomarkers, (ii) discuss new insights into molecular mechanisms and (iii) elucidate novel therapeutic avenues for these long-term consequences of cancer treatment.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/14\/2023 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"124","Key":"c7f578fd-89ca-46e4-8e5c-48e3774c92f0","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 1 (WF1) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED035","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Research Excluding Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"3b5a3215-acba-4a28-ad12-c29462d32f97","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED035.
