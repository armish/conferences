Decentralizing elements of a clinical trial enable information to be generated and captured without traditional clinical trial infrastructures. These decentralized elements include patient-centric trial flexibilities such as electronic informed consent, virtual clinic visits, delivery of investigational product to the home and obtaining laboratory or imaging assessments locally. COVID-19 provided a proof of concept for several decentralized trial modifications, but whether future cancer trials will deploy these remote trial modifications remains unclear. Calls have been made to avoid going &ldquo;back to business as usual&rdquo;, and several efforts have been undertaken to learn from the COVID experience. This panel would bring together key stakeholders from academics, industry, and government who have projects underway to evaluate lessons learned and to discuss the benefits and challenges in continuing adoption remote trial modifications.<\/p>\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/16\/2023 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"212","Key":"391dd817-afcc-4804-a6c2-66f20c084735","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W315 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DC07","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Regulatory Science and Policy","PrimaryCategory_keys":"b441e0de-a219-40b6-975f-b6340977f0c0","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"DC07.
