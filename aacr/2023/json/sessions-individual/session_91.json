Genetic testing is the recommended option to personalize cancer surveillance in high-risk individuals, albeit sometimes leading to the detection of equivocal variants. In cancer patients, tumor sequencing using multigene panels may result in the identification of potentially hereditary cancers with precise therapeutic options. This session will cover novel aspects in the diagnosis and management of three relevant hereditary cancers. For patients diagnosed with Lynch Syndrome, personalized strategies including immunotherapy will be reviewed. Genetic testing in prostate cancer patients has recently expanded, with increasing implications for screening and treatment in carriers. For BRCA1\/2-associated cancers, specifically, there is the need to identify functional DNA repair deficiency as biomarker of PARP inhibitor response.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"91","Key":"dd4b2c64-8071-4cdc-89b1-a0c0be526f19","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 3-4 (WF3-4) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"APRV01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Molecular\/Cellular Biology and Genetics","PrimaryCategory_keys":"adb9ab13-bf74-46ef-b90d-2033fedb560c","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"APRV01.
