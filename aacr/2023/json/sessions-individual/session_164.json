In this session, we focus on these emerging vulnerabilities and first discuss ferroptosis as a unique cell death modality in cancer induced by lipid peroxidation. We will also discuss pyroptosis and inflammatory cell death mechanisms that are suppressed in many tumors. Finally, we discuss emerging metabolic vulnerabilities of cancer that can be exploited to promote ferroptosis and other cell death mechanisms.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/14\/2023 6:15:00 PM","EndTime":"18:15","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"164","Key":"8ea8c556-13f2-4450-a11d-cd1e0bf24871","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W311 A-D - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED012","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED012.
