CAFs promote cancer progression and metastasis through secretion of cytokines, growth factors and extracellular matrix components and their presence is associated with worse prognosis. CAFs are highly heterogeneous, and comprise of subsets that are diverse in their phenotype, function, and origin. This diversity has defied molecular dissection due to technical challenges and lack of selective markers. Recent technological advances enabled detailed characterization of CAFs functional subpopulations in multiple tumor types, opening the road to long-sought-after CAF-targeted therapy. In this session we will examine the current understanding of CAF subsets and functions, highlighting three specific aspects: CAF lineages and plasticity, Cancer-CAF coevolution, and CAF functions in the metastatic microenvironment.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"161","Key":"a3069cce-2350-4ec7-b051-340586166ffd","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W311 A-D - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED009","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED009.
