Lectures will include new insights gained from next generation sequencing and spatial -omics analysis of these diseases. Dr. Novak will discuss key findings from recent next generation sequencing studies in aggressive B-cell lymphomas and their potential implications. Dr. Lim will cover molecular studies and advances in T-cell lymphomas. Dr. Flowers will describe how new sequencing data and approaches can be integrated into the care of patients and utilized to advances clinical trials for B-cell and T-cell lymphomas.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"87","Key":"0c6989e8-8c14-4aef-a0ce-7d3e839f9dd3","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W307 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"","Number":"AOS12","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Molecular\/Cellular Biology and Genetics","PrimaryCategory_keys":"adb9ab13-bf74-46ef-b90d-2033fedb560c","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AOS12.
