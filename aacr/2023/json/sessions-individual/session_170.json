Over time, cancer cells can evolve to become resistant to the drugs designed to treat them through a combination of genetic mutations and epigenetic changes (changes in gene expression without alteration of the DNA sequence). As resistant cells continue to multiply, they become the dominant population, making the disease more difficult to treat. The evolution of drug resistance can be influenced by factors such as the type of drug used, the length of treatment, and the presence of genetic mutations. In this session, we will cover how these factors contribute to the evolution of resistance as well as new technological approaches to study resistance evolution. We will also examine the challenges associated with resistance evolution and strategies to overcome drug resistance through combination therapy and personalized medicine.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"170","Key":"d11e1064-27ac-4a8e-9337-f06f724888cb","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Chapin Theater - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED017","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED017.
