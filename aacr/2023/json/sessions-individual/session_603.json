We are using the currently most comprehensive proteomics technology, the SomaScan&reg; platform, which measures 7,000 proteins to discover and independently validate diagnostic, predictive, and prognostic biomarkers for various cancers. Our efforts are especially focused on non-invasive biomarkers in serum, plasma, urine, and exosomes for a broad range of clinically highly relevant and challenging indications. Protein biomarker efforts for early detection of liver cancer and for predicting response to immunotherapy in metastatic melanoma will be presented.<\/p>","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"603","Key":"ef06a723-10e6-452b-b2e9-819e6bbeac3e","LastUpdated":"2023-03-30 23:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater C","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>SomaLogic<\/p>\u000a","Number":"ESP08C","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ESP08C.
