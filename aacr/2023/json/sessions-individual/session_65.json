The ability of B cells to modulate cancer growth has been attributed to antibody production, antigen presentation, cytokine release, and immunosuppression, emphasizing the need to better visualize and understand the heterogeneity of B cell responses in cancer. In this session, we will discuss recent preclinical, computational, and translational strategies that highlight how B cell responses are shaped in cancer, evaluate intratumoral B cell maturation as a factor in immunotherapy responsiveness and provide emerging spatial landscape of tumor-associated B cells.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/16\/2023 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"65","Key":"9e2cbd10-4f8f-4bf4-a66c-b850b0f44f9f","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 1 (WF1) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY16","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Immunology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"bd4b7f63-21dc-4421-a11e-628f36cc56fe","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY16.
