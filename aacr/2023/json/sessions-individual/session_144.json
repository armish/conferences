Moreover, PDOs cocultures with stromal and immune cells allow to model tumor cells-host interaction. This Workshop will cover the use of PDOs to evaluate the impact of intratumor heterogeneity and stromal elements on drug responses. Dr Corbo will provide a general overview on the generation of the models as well as their use to dissect genetic diversity in cancer. Dr. Soragni will present her work on high-throughput approaches to leverage PDOs for functional precision medicine in the context of common and rare cancers. The talk by Dr Tape will cover the integration of PDOs cocultures with high-throughput single-cell technology to study tumor microenvironmental signaling.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"144","Key":"d5196f5a-e410-43a3-9434-1707b6721fc9","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Valencia BC - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW016","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW016.
