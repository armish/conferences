TIL-B and TLS are prominent components of the immunologically ‘hottest’ tumor microenvironments. Accordingly, they generally carry strong, positive prognostic significance and have been implicated in successful responses to immune checkpoint blockade. This session will review the fundamentals of B cell biology in the context of anti-tumor immunity. We will discuss how B cell responses are initiated, including their target antigens and tolerance mechanisms. The multi-faceted effector mechanisms used by TIL-B and their antibodies will be presented, as well as the counter-balancing role of regulatory B cells. Finally, we will describe how TIL-B, T cells, myeloid cells and stromal cells assemble to form tertiary lymphoid structures that amplify anti-tumor immunity.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"138","Key":"26c02893-ca61-46b3-95c9-97138b56a25d","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 1 (WF1) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED041","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Immunology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"bd4b7f63-21dc-4421-a11e-628f36cc56fe","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED041.
