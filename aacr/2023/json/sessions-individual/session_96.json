A comprehensive approach to cancer health equity must be rooted in strategies that seek to eliminate deep-rooted societal-, system-, and personal- level barriers. The underlying causes of these barriers are complex, and they often influence each other. We submit that personalized cancer health equity lies at the interface of the multiple circumstances that are unique to each patient to improve cancer outcomes. This panel will discuss novel approaches to cancer health equity that extend beyond the four walls of health systems.  Our panelists will review the current state of cancer health equity, delineate approaches to harnessing the power of authentic community engagement, and detail strategies to overcome inequities in access to clinical trials.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"96","Key":"07b1787a-4f07-41cd-ac85-cb4dddcee70d","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 1 (WF1) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ASD02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Cancer Disparities","PrimaryCategory_keys":"8f20dc38-c27e-4e8a-8013-6a339e738e57","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ASD02.
