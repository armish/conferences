However, KRAS has historically been difficult to target directly.  This session will cover recent advances in the development of direct KRAS inhibitors, including allele-specific KRAS inhibitors as well as inhibitors capable of targeting one or more RAS isoforms.  Critical mechanisms of adaptive and acquired resistance and mechanisms by which KRAS inhibition can affect the tumor immune microenvironment will be reviewed with an eye toward future clinical strategies to treat KRAS mutant cancers.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"75","Key":"1094a9b2-ccaf-4d8f-a94c-82a0923f9a95","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Valencia D - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY42","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Experimental and Molecular Therapeutics","PrimaryCategory_keys":"0d625edf-5868-466a-91a7-aa8cee8d035f","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY42.
