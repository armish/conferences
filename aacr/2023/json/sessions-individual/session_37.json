Cellular therapies are emerging as an important pillar of cancer immunotherapies. However, T cell-based approaches face a wide range of limitations e.g., the requirement for autologous cell products and immune-related adverse events. In contrast, allogenic innate lymphoid cell-based therapies could overcome these limitations, as they hold promise to be cost effective with scaled manufacturing for multi-dosing, on demand off-the-shelf availability and less toxicity. To develop an effective product that expands, persists and maintains anti-tumor functions in patients, we need to better understand the complex phenotypic plasticity, heterogeneity and function of innate lymphoid cells. In this session, we will discuss the use of pre-clinical mouse models and human samples to study innate lymphoid cell biology as well as recent clinical advances.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"37","Key":"ccb0119b-f786-4a1b-832d-25a59c037afd","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 3-4 (WF3-4) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY11","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Immunology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"bd4b7f63-21dc-4421-a11e-628f36cc56fe","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY11.
