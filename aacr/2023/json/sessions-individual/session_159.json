This phenomenon, now known as the Warburg effect, has been investigated extensively for many decades and is leveraged to diagnose and stage many cancers in the clinic by imaging fluorodeoxglucose with PET. This body of research, while incredibly important, has primarily focused on a single nutrient: glucose. Glucose is just one of many nutrients that are potentially available to tumors. With the advent of metabolomics in the twenty-first century, it has not only become increasingly feasible to interrogate other nutrient pathways in cancer but also to probe glucose metabolism at unprecedented depth. Presentations in this session will demonstrate how modern metabolic techniques have been applied to advance our understanding of tumor biology beyond the initial observations made by Warburg. The talks will highlight new insights into the Warburg effect, other metabolic changes that occur in cancer outside of glycolysis, pathways that are activated during metastasis, and ways in which tumors adapt to the unique nutrients present across different microenvironments.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/14\/2023 6:15:00 PM","EndTime":"18:15","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"159","Key":"509f5519-8ea8-46c6-91e3-9181d534e419","LastUpdated":"2023-03-30 23:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 3-4 (WF3-4) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED029","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED029.
