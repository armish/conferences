These various constituents form multifaceted interactions that shape cellular behavior (e.g., metastasis, immune evasion) and play a key role in determining drug response\/resistance. Novel molecular profiling methods and analytical developments provide the necessary tools for disentangling tumor ecosystems. Furthermore, innovative pre-clinical models that more faithfully recapitulate the tumor-microenvironment and microbiome provide new functional insights into the interplay between cancer cells, progressive immune (dys-)function and potential opportunities for novel therapeutic development. In this session, we will discuss 1) how genomic features, such as chromosomal instability confer metastatic organotropism, 2) novel analytical tools to determine consequential cell-to-cell interactions more accurately, 3) a platform for efficient generation of humanized, autologous tumor\/immune models, and 4) the interface of type 2 immunity, cancer and the microbiome.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/19\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"35","Key":"9bf07b44-8730-4fb6-b142-cefbaa770faf","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Valencia A - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY09","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY09.
