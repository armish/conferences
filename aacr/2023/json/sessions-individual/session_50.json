To support their proliferation and survival, immune cells also take up  fuels, such as glucose, amino acids and lipids, required for their effector functions. Competition between T cells and tumor cells for nutrients contributes to the metabolic hostility of the tumor microenvironment (TME). The diet supplies most of the nutrients in the TME and chnges in dietary intake can promote or inhibit tumor growth. This session will present findings on how dietary manipulation can change the course of tumor progression.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"50","Key":"6ba8a868-ccab-4afd-b6e6-6f0970918d41","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W414 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY38","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Prevention \/ Early Detection \/ Interception","PrimaryCategory_keys":"fe4903b1-5af5-4508-908c-2e0994986a26","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY38.
