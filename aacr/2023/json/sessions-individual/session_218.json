Routine cancer screening is recommended for only four cancers (breast, cervical, colorectal and, lung) and individualized decision making considering the potential risks and benefits of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer has a C rating from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Multi-cancer early detection (MCED) assays are designed to detect cancer at very early stages and have the potential to be highly utilized due to their noninvasive nature and ability to screen for multiple cancers at one time. This session will explore remaining unanswered questions regarding the future development and integration of MCED assays into routine clinical care, including: trial designs and diversity; who should be tested and how often; how to follow up a positive MCED assay when there is no evidence of cancer; and impact of inaccurate results.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"218","Key":"c10f7e28-e264-483a-b31e-0e600f14f8b3","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W315 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DC13","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Regulatory Science and Policy","PrimaryCategory_keys":"b441e0de-a219-40b6-975f-b6340977f0c0","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"DC13.
