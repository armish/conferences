We optimized a custom 26-marker fluorescently conjugated antibody panel interrogating HER2 expression, HER2 signaling, stromal, and immune markers via MultiOmyx and applied it to a tissue microarray encompassing 640 total cores from of 208 unique HER2+ tumors, totaling 1,076,700 single cells profiled. This allowed concurrent assessment of 1) HER2 heterogeneity at four spatial resolutions; 2) single cell-level phenotypic analyses of concurrent expression of six HER2 signaling proteins in tumor cells; 3) immunophenotype of 23 immune cell types.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 11:00:00 AM","EndTime":"11:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"577","Key":"f1904c59-a95d-4d33-8a00-8869c593ac13","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater B","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>NeoGenomics<\/p>\u000a","Number":"ESP03B","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ESP03B.
