However, the efficacy of this approach depends on a mechanistic understanding of the metabolic requirements of cancer cells and how modulation of circulating metabolites impacts the tumor and surrounding environment. Metabolic changes in cancer cells allow adaptation to stress imposed by events such as hypoxia, loss of normal stromal support and increased oxidative stress, but these changes can lead to vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically. Our work has focused on exploring how serine metabolism supports cancer growth and metastasis, with evidence that dietary serine and glycine depletion can be effective in limiting cancer growth and metastasis in various mouse models. We are beginning to understand what determines the requirement for exogenous serine and the how serine limitation could be used to augment the efficacy of conventional and targeted therapies.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/19\/2023 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"682","Key":"cb564272-2607-4a7d-932b-c3a2a5fe5dd8","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W315 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME54","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME54.
