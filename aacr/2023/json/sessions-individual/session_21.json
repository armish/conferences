To date, the results of trials of ICT combinations have met with limited and sporadic success. Most notably, the combination of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 has been shown to improve clinical outcomes for patients with metastatic melanoma, renal carcinoma and non-small cell carcinoma. Recently, anti-PD-1 plus anti-LAG-3 combination also demonstrated clinical benefit in the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma.  However, the Phase 3 clinical trial of anti-PD-1 plus bempegaldeslukin failed to meet clinical endpoints. Similarly, the Phase 3 trial of anti-PD-L1 plus the androgen receptor antagonist enzalutamide for castrate resistant prostate cancer failed to demonstrate improved clinical benefit for the combination. This session will discuss these and other combination therapy studies, including those with translational studies focused on understating mechanisms of responses and resistance, which may provide critical information regarding rational combination strategies to increase the success rate of ICT combinations.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 6:30:00 PM","EndTime":"18:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"21","Key":"2ac36c9e-6b9d-4e27-bd99-0c37add636d9","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Chapin Theater - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"FO11","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Research Excluding Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"3b5a3215-acba-4a28-ad12-c29462d32f97","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"FO11.
