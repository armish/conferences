In addition to elucidating the intrinsic plasticity and orchestrating properties of circulating and disseminating tumor cells, new discoveries have highlighted the constant fate-determining confrontation or collaboration between tumor cells and immune microenvironment. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with stem cell properties are considered the initiating seeds of distant metastases with advantageous of collaborative cluster formation to survive and regenerate tumors. Nevertheless, CTCs and disseminating tumor cells (DTCs) may undergo elimination, dormancy, or colonization, based on the hostility or hospitality of the soil microenvironment, including immune system, other stromal cells, vasculature or angiogenesis, extracellular matrix, metabolites, oxygen levels, etc. This session will report recent advances in dissecting the collaborative or disruptive features of CTCs, DTCs, and immune cells during cancer metastasis.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/14\/2023 6:15:00 PM","EndTime":"18:15","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"160","Key":"41e51ce2-05a9-442f-bad9-a376103c6f6f","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 1 (WF1) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED008","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED008.
