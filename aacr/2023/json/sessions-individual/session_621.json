This process reflects a state of continuous tumor evolution, where hundreds of malignant clones are constantly in cooperation and competition with each other in a mostly unfavorable microenvironment to select <i>fitness<\/i> traits of adaptation and plasticity in cellular responses. The session will provide an overview of tumor plasticity and its implications for disease progression, unravel novel biochemical and signaling cascades of metabolic reprogramming and integrated stress response that drive the rise of new, more aggressive cancer traits, including metastatic competence, and discuss emerging therapeutic opportunities to prevent adaptive resistance to treatment.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"621","Key":"e5a251e8-4f09-4fff-bc66-cf698f115634","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W307 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME20","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME20.
