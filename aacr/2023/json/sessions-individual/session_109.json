This educational session will describe core concepts on integrating geospatial science with cancer epidemiology, examples of geospatial data types and availability, commonly used geospatial science tools and technologies, geospatial exposure modeling and data linkages for epidemiologic research, and new and emerging research in the field. At the conclusion of this Methods Workshop, the participant should have a basic understanding of the process for conducting an epidemiologic study that proposes to apply a geospatial-based exposure assessment to investigate an environmental exposure in relation to a cancer outcome in an established prospective cohort\/study population. We will describe examples of applied research spanning a diversity of topics, including studies of a range of environmental exposures (e.g., air pollution, outdoor light at night), social determinants of health (e.g., neighborhood income inequality), and climate change factors (e.g., wildfires) on outcomes for cancer incidence, mortality, and survivorship.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"109","Key":"ad56340e-a3cd-4f5c-a84c-57ef2ec90367","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W311 E-H - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW001","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Population Sciences","PrimaryCategory_keys":"aac4f922-9142-438f-8cca-8bd13134a497","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW001.
