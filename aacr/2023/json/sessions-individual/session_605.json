Imaging Mass Cytometry reliably and accurately quantifies and visualizes the bone marrow microenvironment without autofluorescence. We established a panel of 31 markers for these samples and aim to define biomarkers of clinical outcomes. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\u000a","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"605","Key":"aacfc799-b44b-469f-b12a-87ecb3cd4d13","LastUpdated":"2023-03-24 12:16","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater E","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>Standard Biotools<\/p>\u000a","Number":"ESP08E","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ESP08E.
