In this session, we will describe the Utah Population Database, a collection of statewide medical datasets, 50-years of cancer registry data and a 4.5-million-person genealogy, and discuss family-based study designs for gene discovery, prevention and outcomes. We will describe the appropriate and responsible use of electronic health records to accurately identify treatment plans, improve patient outcomes, and develop predictive models for clinical decision support, and discuss rigorous evaluation for fairness and bias minimization. We will describe the Cancer Research Data Commons, a multi-omics data repository of NCI-funded data for the cancer research community to leverage for discoveries of molecular-based diagnoses and precision treatments. Successful examples of how these resources have supported discoveries and advanced our understanding of the burden of disease at the population level will be given.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"156","Key":"a79c0e15-8a78-433e-b77b-8d032be8583b","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W311 A-D - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED005","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Population Sciences","PrimaryCategory_keys":"aac4f922-9142-438f-8cca-8bd13134a497","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED005.
