This session will explore recent advances in understanding how T cells are optimally activated, which mediators are most critical for their function, and what subsets provide the most durable anti-tumor responses. Focusing on negative checkpoints, studies will address the molecular mechanism whereby LAG3 inhibits T cell activation and illustrate how structural biology can optimize the development of immune-based therapies. In addressing effector mechanisms, the dual role of IFN and T cells in cancer immunotherapy will be presented, with a focus on underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Lastly, studies will address the role of resident memory T cells and mechanisms underlying tissue-localized recall responses to cancer. By extending work from mouse models to patients, this work will also address potential clinical approaches to improve T cell function against cancer.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"45","Key":"a710eeb4-158a-4bb0-89fa-fe0d76d5a6d6","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 2 (WF2) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY13","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Research Excluding Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"3b5a3215-acba-4a28-ad12-c29462d32f97","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY13.
