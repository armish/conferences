Regarded as the gold standard in developing therapeutic and non-therapeutic interventions, the advantages of clinical trials include access to new approaches that may not be available outside the clinical trial setting, exposure to more effective approach, access to regular and medical attention from a team comprising clinicians and researchers, being among the first people to benefit from the new method and helping others in the future. Unfortunately, the lack of representation of minoritized and marginalized populations in oncology clinical trials (due to multiple factors at the personal-level, provider\/researcher-level, protocol-level and health systems-level), &nbsp;continues to exacerbate cancer health disparities in these populations. Addressing the disparities in oncology clinical trials requires the embracement of novel approaches by all stakeholders, including patients, providers, investigators, funders, regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical organizations.","Duration":75,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"611","Key":"7eeda3f2-9034-46fe-bacc-7e01ecfea892","LastUpdated":"2023-04-17 15:51","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W304 E-H - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY44","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"4668ebd3-0460-4c09-a084-82a9f9fccb0f","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY44.
