It can also complement existing omics techniques to increase observations and generate new hypotheses. Our study analysis includes diverse central nervous system (CNS) tumor samples together with the rarely profiled adjacent brain, and conditions such as epilepsy and IgG4 disease. Exploiting the flexibility of panels built with label-free antibodies, the automated COMET&trade; platform and a rapid optimization workflow, we developed a comprehensive and universal CNS profiling panel that can benefit the field of neuroscience as a tool to unravel CNS microenvironment.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"589","Key":"3dadacc8-9802-4ded-9ba0-9fd11527ad72","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater D","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>Lunaphore Technologies<\/p>\u000a","Number":"ESP05D","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ESP05D.
