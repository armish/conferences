There will bea panel discussion at the end of the session focused on elucidating the challenges in the field and approaches tosolve them. Thus, the overarching goal of the symposium will be to foster interdisciplinary research andcollaborations across the many distinct yet overlapping quantitative aspects of cancer research.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"26","Key":"ece92d82-735e-4d45-a68a-384c0bac58ed","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W311 E-H - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY30","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Chemistry","PrimaryCategory_keys":"c109d41b-9294-4260-90d6-14ee96687c6c","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY30.
