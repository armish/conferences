However, recent advances in our understanding of the unique biology of pediatric and adult brain tumor subtypes have fostered the development of promising treatment strategies for these cancers. This session will focus on new brain tumor therapies that are currently being investigated in preclinical or clinical studies. Clinical results of two recently completed studies of ONC201, a DRD2 antagonist and mitochondrial ClpP agonist, in diffuse midline glioma will be discussed. Attendees will also learn about approaches to target different aspects of the tumor microenvironment in glioblastoma and medulloblastoma to improve immunotherapy for these brain tumors. Finally, metabolic dependencies induced by IDH oncogenes in glioma will be discussed, as well as synthetic lethality-based treatment strategies designed to exploit them. In summary, this session will highlight brain tumor research that spans basic, translational, and clinical investigation and is driven by fundamental insights into disease biology.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"74","Key":"bfaae825-d86e-4194-b627-29c1b47223c8","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W307 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AOS01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Research Excluding Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"3b5a3215-acba-4a28-ad12-c29462d32f97","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AOS01.
