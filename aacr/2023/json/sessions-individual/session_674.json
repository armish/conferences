In solid tumors featuring a prominent stromal reaction, an improved understanding of the functions and origins of abundant stromal cell types may facilitate the development of new and effective therapies.  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the quintessence of a fibro-inflammatory malignancy, with 50-90% of tumor volume occupied by a dense, desmoplastic stroma. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the key cell type which drives the stromal reaction in PDAC, and recent reports suggest that stromal CAFs represent a heterogeneous population of cells from diverse origins, potentially including cell types which support and others which suppress tumor growth. This session will feature discussion of advances in our understanding of PDAC CAF heterogeneity, cellular origin, and function, including their tumor-permissive interactions with the immune system and other features that may serve as promising therapeutic targets.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/19\/2023 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"674","Key":"3355932c-ec8c-46b7-9fee-096e03c1f3b1","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W312 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME53","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Microenvironment","PrimaryCategory_keys":"222c16a5-1f03-4d91-a16f-f59e4684198f","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME53.
