In the past few years DTP has greatly expanded its capabilities to serve the extramural discovery and development community. One example of new resources includes the manufacturing of retroviral and lentiviral transduction vectors and the manufacture of CAR T cell products for clinical immunotherapy trials. Researchers can access DTP&rsquo;s services through <a href=\"http:\/\/next.cancer.gov\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the NCI Experimental Therapeutic program (NExT)<\/a>. In addition, NCI grantees may be provided gap-filling development services through the Stepping Stones program.&nbsp;<\/p>","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 1:30:00 PM","EndTime":"13:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"755","Key":"704cdc68-e6f4-484d-b0e1-2d282867eb7e","LastUpdated":"2023-03-30 23:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W314 A - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"NIH09","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"NIH09.
