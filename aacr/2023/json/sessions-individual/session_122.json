HTAN is working closely with NCI Cancer Research Data Commons to ensure long term-legacy and reuse of HTAN data and to share data using NCI&#39;s Cloud Resources. In this session, speakers describe how to access, query, download, process, and visualize HTAN data derived from a variety of assay types, including single cell RNA sequencing and multiplexed spatial proteomics, using the HTAN Data Portal and NCI Cloud Resources.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"122","Key":"f5699397-77b2-4f88-8250-1932a2270f35","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W414 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"MW006","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Bioinformatics \/ Computational Biology \/ Systems Biology \/ Convergent Science","PrimaryCategory_keys":"48d8ff66-f809-4191-ba2b-5f22b0f95ef3","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"MW006.
