This 360-degree approach to precision diagnostics requires the deployment of novel analytical solutions. BostonGene will present how harmonizing Agilent-supported NGS techniques with production-scale research bioinformatics powered the development of the Tumor Immunity Portrait, a CAP\/CLIA-certified platform that provides the most detailed reconstruction of the tumor microenvironment to date. Currently providing robust solutions from clinical decision support to patient stratification for immunotherapy clinical trials.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/16\/2023 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"568","Key":"8abd4dc4-83d2-4d27-a0e8-6206e17fd6f0","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater C","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>Agilent Technologies<\/p>\u000d\u000a","Number":"ESP01C","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ESP01C.
