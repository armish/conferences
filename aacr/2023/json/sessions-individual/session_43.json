For the last two decades, precision oncology has used nearly exclusively the tool of genomics. Notable successes include the assignment of EGFR, BRAF, and TRK inhibitors to patients bearing activating mutations in those genes. However, the great number of oncology patients left unserved by genomics-only strategies of precision medicine have prompted reexamination of a simple idea: If you want to know if a drug will work on a patient's tumor, put the drug on the tumor tissue and measure something relevant. Modern examples of this so-called functional precision medicine take advantage of important technological advances made over the past three decades. These advances include a dramatically increased number of informative and useful drugs; ready availability of single cell analysis; improved ex vivo culture conditions, including two- and three-dimensional environments; and better readouts probing metabolism, apoptosis and viability. In this session, we will hear about three examples of functional precision medicine being incorporated into clinical practice in major medical centers.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"43","Key":"99bb3b76-0811-43f4-a5b5-5584c46fd3bc","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 2 (WF2) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Research Excluding Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"3b5a3215-acba-4a28-ad12-c29462d32f97","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT01.
