Thus, a further improvement in lung cancer mortality may be particularly productive in further reducing the US cancer burden. Understanding differences in lung cancer risk, screening practices and smoking behaviors among US populations might provide new avenues for preventing lung cancer deaths and extending these favorable trends into the future. This presentation will review our current understanding of lung cancer disparities and the use of multiethnic studies to investigate them. These studies have shown that, compared to non-Hispanic white smokers, African American and Native Hawaiian smokers have a ~50% increased risk, and Japanese American and Latino smokers a 50% decreased risk of lung cancer for a given lifetime smoking history. Among non-smokers, Chinese American women have been shown to be at elevated risk for the disease. In addition, minority patients are more often diagnosed with a late stage. Biomarker studies have clarified the roles of smoking behavior and nicotine metabolism in explaining some of these risk differences. However, the excess risk of Native Hawaiians remain unexplained. The efficacy of low-dose CT screening in reducing lung cancer mortality was demonstrated over ten years ago; however, its utilization remains low across the US and its potential as a tool to specifically decrease disparities in lung cancer mortality remains understudied.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"654","Key":"2fde8699-8fbe-46c4-82b5-3a0063fd4f53","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W230 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME10","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME10.
