The KIF5B [Exon 1-15] -RET [Exon 12-19] fusion gene was chosen as a primary candidate. Affinity of neopeptides formed by the translated fusion junction was tested in silico using MHCNuggets. The Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Spot Assay will be used in vitro to assess CD8+ T cell response to peptide and mRNA stimulation. Single cell 5' gene expression and T cell receptor mapping will be used to evaluate clonotype expansion to improve adoptive immune therapies administered in parallel.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 11:00:00 AM","EndTime":"11:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"580","Key":"0c191405-c307-462a-b215-50de56b88046","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater E","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>QIAGEN<\/p>\u000a","Number":"ESP03E","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ESP03E.
