Additionally, the Fiscal Year 2023 federal appropriations package included provisions requiring the use of diversity action plans for drug and device development. Diversity action plans are powerful tools to formulate drug and device development strategies that represent the intended patient population to be treated and aid discussions between FDA and sponsors. This session will discuss effective strategies being used by sponsors to develop diversity action plans, illustrate how diversity action plans are changing the drug development landscape, and consider the ongoing challenges that sponsors are confronting as they seek to improve diversity in clinical trials.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"215","Key":"4e5cd14f-ee95-43d0-ab7e-2d9ed0eb97e6","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W315 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DC10","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Regulatory Science and Policy","PrimaryCategory_keys":"b441e0de-a219-40b6-975f-b6340977f0c0","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"DC10.
