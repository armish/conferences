The focus is on how to write well for grants, how to structure an aims page to help the reviewer &quot;get&quot; all the information you want them to, and how to write an aims page that makes a reviewer excited about your grant. We will address different types of grants from NIH (Rs, Ks, Fs etc.) as well as grants from other countries. We will also discuss Summary Statements (&quot;pink sheets&quot;) and have a roundtable where participants can network and ask experienced scientists questions about the grants they are working on. <a href=\"https:\/\/aacr.secure-platform.com\/a\/page\/am23-grant-writing-workshop\" target=\"_blank\">Pre-registration is encouraged<\/a> but is not required.<\/p>\u000a","Duration":240,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/14\/2023 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"689","Key":"69562e79-56e4-45ab-b664-586a58e7493f","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"W Hall E2 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"PAS01","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Career Development","PrimaryCategory_keys":"9539057c-c764-401b-9630-d2eacb4316e0","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"PAS01.
