Promising clinical study designs now must select patients enriched for the best biomarkers or clinical hypotheses available, evaluate primary and secondary resistance mechanisms and modify arms in an adaptive platform design that reviews clinical signals faster, earlier and with fewer patients than trials of the past. The conversations occurring now around these evolving laboratory models of PDAC, many reviewed in this session should inform next designs. Such data brought to molecular tumor board discussions and applied to real-time patient care decisions on trials will serve to further expand the PDAC subtypes and therefore impact more patients with better and tailored therapies.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"84","Key":"4b361827-3241-4a2f-81a6-beeb6dd6a44a","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Valencia BC - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"","Number":"AOS09","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"4668ebd3-0460-4c09-a084-82a9f9fccb0f","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AOS09.
