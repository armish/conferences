In this session, the goals of optimal patient-centered, ethical cancer care will be reviewed, and situations in which these tenets are challenged will be highlighted.  Presenters will focus on the evidence available to inform care of pregnant patients and important gaps in the literature with regard to the risks of treatment to a pregnant patient and fetus, particularly as cancer treatment improves with the introduction of new therapies and treatment modalities.  Evolving concerns in the current medical and sociopolitical environment will be considered particularly when patient survival is compromised when therapies are deferred or omitted to prevent fetal exposure.  The invaluable patient perspective will infuse the session, with the aim of presenting a multidisciplinary, sensitive approach to guide the management of this increasing issue in oncology.","Duration":75,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 1:00:00 PM","EndTime":"13:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"60","Key":"73d60121-de7f-48ca-9813-4f4cedeceb59","LastUpdated":"2023-03-30 23:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Chapin Theater - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY40","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Research Excluding Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"3b5a3215-acba-4a28-ad12-c29462d32f97","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY40.
