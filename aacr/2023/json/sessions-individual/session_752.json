Successfully competing for NIH\/NCI funding requires updated knowledge regarding funding and review policies. For the past decade, NCI and NIH Center for Scientific Review (CSR) staff have provided an interactive session at the annual AACR meeting to update basic and translational researchers on current policies and funding opportunities. This session, often held early on Sunday morning, is traditionally well-attended (200+ participants) and provides an opportunity for early-stage and established investigators to interact directly with NCI and CSR staff.  Speakers for the 2023 NIH Grants Session will include Dr. Dan Gallahan, the Director of the Division of Cancer Biology (DCB), Dr. Amy Rubenstein, the Chief of the Basic and Translational Cancer Review Branch within CSR, and Dr. Shannon Hughes, DCB Deputy Director. Topics to be covered include current funding trends in basic cancer biology research, new grants policies (such as the NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy), and changes in CSR review (including the new oncology study sections introduced in Fall 2022). As is tradition, significant time will be conserved for questions from the audience. Additionally, NCI program staff will be in attendance to speak with participants after the session to answer further questions. <\/p>","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 5:00:00 PM","EndTime":"17:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"752","Key":"9edb2649-6bb3-4995-95af-9cbedb5df67b","LastUpdated":"2023-03-30 23:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W314 A - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"NIH06","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"NIH06.
