She will present vignettes illustrating collaborations with basic, translational, clinical, and population scientists and findings from those collaborations. Vignettes will include research on intraprostatic inflammation in the etiology of prostate cancer; telomere length in prostate stromal cells and variability in telomere length in prostate cancer cells and prostate cancer prognosis; and new research on senescent stromal fibroblasts in the etiology of lethal prostate cancer. Other team science vignettes will include leveraging a cardiovascular disease study to investigate the etiologic links of periodontal disease and associated bacteria with cancer, and new research aiming to identify modifiable drivers of clonal hematopoiesis to hematologic malignancy.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"688","Key":"85013a4e-0a40-46bf-add9-5114d7140b49","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W311 A-D - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME15","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME15.
