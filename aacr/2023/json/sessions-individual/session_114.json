In the three sessions, we will introduce core methods and data types analyzed in investigations of the microbiota in colorectal cancer and provide a review of the state of the field. Presenters will cover recent findings focused on specific oncomicrobes in preclinical models as well as epidemiologic and translational investigations of the microbiome spanning prevention and cancer progression.  Participants will gain familiarity with microbiome study methods relevant for colorectal cancer and approaches designed to unravel correlation and elucidate causal relationships between bacteria and cancer.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"114","Key":"babf18bb-b7a0-409b-a10d-96c606421cfb","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W311 E-H - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED031","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Population Sciences","PrimaryCategory_keys":"aac4f922-9142-438f-8cca-8bd13134a497","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED031.
