The speakers will discuss approaches, new findings, and challenges in three different fields addressing the bacteria-cancer axis. The first talk will summarize epidemiological research on bacteria, immunity, and cancer risk; the second talk will highlight how gut microbes influence gut immunity; and the third talk will provide an overview of collaborative efforts across research and clinical teams to develop strategies to target the microbiome in cancer patients.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/14\/2023 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"111","Key":"a19b1bc4-947a-408f-a222-1e5a43c3635f","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W331 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED030","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Molecular\/Cellular Biology and Genetics","PrimaryCategory_keys":"adb9ab13-bf74-46ef-b90d-2033fedb560c","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED030.
