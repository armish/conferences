In this talk we focus on how we can optimize each phase of clinical development by applying novel machine learning methodologies. We present case studies showcasing how (1) external control arms give an early evaluation of treatment efficacy for single-arm phase II trials; (2) biomarkers for identification of subgroups support precision medicine as early as in phase I\/II trials; (3) adjustment on prognostic covariates increases the statistical power of randomized phase III trials.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/16\/2023 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"567","Key":"75db9cc8-8f6e-49c4-af42-1c7dc36d0467","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater B","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>Owkin<\/p>\u000d\u000a","Number":"ESP01B","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ESP01B.
