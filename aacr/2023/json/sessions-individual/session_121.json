The cells also have partially overlapping expression profiles for the effector molecules (costimulatory ligands, cytokines, and chemokines) necessary to orchestrate effective anti-tumor immunity. Despite these similarities, macrophages and dendritic cells have opposing roles in cancer progression and response to therapies such as immune checkpoint blockade. In this session, presenters will detail how macrophages and dendritic cells differentially regulate the tumor immune microenvironment. The speakers will also describe the preclinical and clinical approaches being used to target these cells to improve responses to various forms of therapy.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"121","Key":"1149893b-d477-41f5-83d5-ca0ef1a04851","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 3-4 (WF3-4) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED034","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Immunology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"bd4b7f63-21dc-4421-a11e-628f36cc56fe","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED034.
