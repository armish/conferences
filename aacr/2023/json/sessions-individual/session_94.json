Fortunately, tobacco cessation dramatically decreases the risk of lung and other cancers, and is a cornerstone of cancer prevention and control. Moreover, evidence-based tobacco cessation treatment is both efficacious and cost-effective. Estimates of cost per life year saved range from $128 to $1450, lower than virtually any other health related intervention. Furthermore, 70% of current smokers want to quit and over 50% attempt to quit each year. Unfortunately, over 90% of those quit attempts fail, in large part because only about 20% of quit attempts utilize any form of evidence-based treatment, and despite significant advances in identifying new medications, quit rates remain in the 30-40% range in the best of cases.<br \/>&nbsp;Dr. Wetter will present results from a long-term program of research designed to test implementation strategies for increasing the reach of tobacco cessation treatment delivered by Quitlines. These implementation strategies focus on utilizing health information technology at the point of care and via population health management approaches.<br \/>Dr. Schnoll will present results from pragmatic studies testing electronic medical record-delivered messages (nudges) informed by behavioral economics to improve tobacco treatment in healthcare settings.<br \/>Dr. Cinciripini will present results from a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Clinical Trial designed to optimize tobacco cessation medication regimens over the course of treatment.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"94","Key":"e0e4b29b-200a-42b8-9965-b0e477e999ec","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W311 A-D - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"APRV04","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Prevention \/ Early Detection \/ Interception","PrimaryCategory_keys":"fe4903b1-5af5-4508-908c-2e0994986a26","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"APRV04.
