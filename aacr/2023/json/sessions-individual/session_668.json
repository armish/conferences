Spatial biology is a new frontier for revealing tissue microneighborhoods that depict how dozens of highly interacting cells, composed of multiple cell types, organize themselves. New methods are needed to map and quantify these tissue microneighborhoods, identify the global set of interactions within and between them, and point to clinically relevant patterns as a tumor evolves. The faculty will review state-of-the-art technologies in spatial -omics and machine learning approaches toward identifying and further refining spatial biomarkers for cancer progression.","Duration":45,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 7:45:00 AM","EndTime":"07:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"668","Key":"bba90539-1435-422e-84bc-76c9983be1a2","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W311 A-D - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ME31","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME31.
