We and others have found that cancer stem cells (CSCs) from glioblastoma and other cancers display selective dependency on adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing, which induces alterations of tumor metabolism, including ganglioside catabolism. CSCs also display alterations in n6-methyladenosine (m6A) regulation, including contributions of writers, readers, and erasers to tumor growth through downstream effects on metabolic survival mechanisms. As novel therapeutics targeting regulators of mRNA modifications are being developed, epitranscriptomics and bridging tumor metabolism offer new therapeutic paradigms that may improve the treatment of cancer patients.<\/p>\u000a","Number":"ME33","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ME33.
