This session will start with an overview of changes in the extracellular matrix during cancer progression, and what is known about how these changes impact tumor phenotype, proliferation, and invasion. Next, how the emerging understanding of how the interplay between the extracellular matrix, stromal cells, and immune cells regulates cancer progression will be discussed. The session will then focus on the impact of changes in ECM structure and mechanics on T-cell proliferation, migration, and function. Finally, emerging areas and outstanding questions for the field will be identified and discussed.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"183","Key":"23dd79ae-9e9a-4ec6-8c5e-80774d953835","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 1 (WF1) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED020","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED020.
