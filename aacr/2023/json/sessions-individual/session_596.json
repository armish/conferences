The Genesis Cell Isolation System using Celselect SlidesTM for comprehensive CTC enrichment or enumeration and the QX600 ddPCR system for analysis of circulating nucleic acids are a step change in cellular and molecular analysis of liquid biopsies. With unbiased size selection of CTCs and 6-color multiplexing capabilities these platforms provide a comprehensive workflow capability for enumerating CTCs, quantifying ctDNA, or combining CTC enrichment together with analysis of captured CTCs at the molecular or cellular level.&nbsp;<\/p>","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 1:30:00 PM","EndTime":"13:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"596","Key":"d5de054a-ebf2-4794-b2f9-28f12617181d","LastUpdated":"2023-03-30 23:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater A","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>Bio-Rad<\/p>\u000a","Number":"ESP07A","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ESP07A.
