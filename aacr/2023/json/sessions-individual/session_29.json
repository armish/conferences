This session covers novel technology to deeply understand developmental states of tumor cells\/cancer stem cells at the single cell level, which can be used to predict clinical outcomes and new therapeutic targets. We will present new findings illustrate how STAT3, frequently associated with various therapy resistance, promotes lipid metabolic reprogramming, leading to cancer cell resistance to therapy, and inhibition of tumor CD8 T cell activation. We will also show recent findings uncovering multifaceted molecular programs and adaptations that are induced by therapy across the tumor and tumor-tumor microenvironment ecosystem, followed by discussing next-generation therapeutic strategies for NSCLC.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/18\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"29","Key":"3f49fb16-0f5a-4680-bc13-9fbcce4ce1b2","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W304 A-D - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY03","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY03.
