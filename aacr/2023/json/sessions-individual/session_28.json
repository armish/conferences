CSCs have been demonstrated to be resistant to conventional treatments such as chemotherapy. Since CSCs can fuel tumor relapse, approaches to ensure their elimination constitute a major need. In this session, we will explore how CSCs appear, evolve and modify their host tumor, as well as the mechanisms they use to survive during therapy. Moreover, we will also discuss how CSCs interact with the tumor immune microenvironment, how they escape from immune recognition and how to target them by means of immunotherapy.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 2:00:00 PM","EndTime":"14:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"28","Key":"fa9da5c7-862d-498f-a390-2255e9d33eac","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W224 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY02","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Research Excluding Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"3b5a3215-acba-4a28-ad12-c29462d32f97","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY02.
