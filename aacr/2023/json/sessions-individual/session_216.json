Leading experts from academia and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will provide their unique perspectives as to how emerging data and evidence may guide translational and clinical pediatric cancer research efforts. Presentations will be followed by an interactive discussion between attendees and speakers to discuss the current state and future of pediatric cancer therapeutics, including how RWE aims to enhance clinical trial design, optimization, and implementation in pediatric populations.<\/p>\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"216","Key":"ad69888a-eacd-4e37-ba38-c681ec649635","LastUpdated":"2023-04-14 04:33","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W315 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DC11","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Drug Development","PrimaryCategory_keys":"1b9cdf0a-9d16-4a07-a5ef-2fc8884e0367","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"DC11.
