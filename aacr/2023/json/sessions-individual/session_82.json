Balkwill). Novel preclinical work targeting the ovarian microenvironment will be discussed and pathways forward imagined (K. Fuh). Finally - early clinical data from trials exploring engineered cellular therapies and bispecific antibodies in ovarian cancer will be presented and placed in context of the greater ovarian cancer landscape (K. Moore).<\/p>","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"82","Key":"4ad32ff7-de79-494d-987f-1263066cf4c3","LastUpdated":"2023-03-30 23:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W304 E-H - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"AOS07","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Research Excluding Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"3b5a3215-acba-4a28-ad12-c29462d32f97","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"AOS07.
