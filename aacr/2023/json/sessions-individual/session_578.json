The presenters will also introduce a novel family of PhenoCode Panels that will simplify the workflow to study dozens of biomarker targets, including protein and RNA, across multiple sample types. And finally, the speakers will discuss how the discoveries from high plex spatial biology can be effectively moved over into translational and clinical research.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 11:00:00 AM","EndTime":"11:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"578","Key":"635b6c45-f84a-4ce9-a83d-618fc76a3cb6","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater C","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>Akoya Biosciences<\/p>\u000a","Number":"ESP03C","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ESP03C.
