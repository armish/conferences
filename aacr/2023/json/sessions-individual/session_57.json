Despite technological advances in conformal delivery of RT, there is still incidental dose deposition to normal tissues resulting in significant toxicities and morbidity. Less than a decade ago, landmark animal studies using ultra-high dose rate (“FLASH”) RT, generated tremendous excitement due to this modality’s reduced normal tissue toxicity and equipotency with conventional RT in controlling tumor growth. Since then, numerous studies have demonstrated similar results in multiple mouse models and larger animals. Importantly, a safety-feasibility clinical trial with proton FLASH RT in patients with metastatic bone cancer has been completed and others are being planned. The mechanisms behind the sparing effects of FLASH are still obscure and actively being investigated. In this symposium, we will present recently published and unpublished results with electron and proton FLASH RT in mouse and canine normal and tumor tissues.  We will also present results from scRNAseq analyses, knockout mouse models and oxygen measurements that hint at potential mechanisms behind the FLASH RT sparing effect.  Finally, we will discuss critical parameters and unanswered questions which impact optimal clinical implementation of FLASH RT.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/16\/2023 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"57","Key":"a6b25396-699d-44c2-a7ad-3c43eb2454b2","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W307 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ADT08","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Clinical Research Excluding Trials","PrimaryCategory_keys":"3b5a3215-acba-4a28-ad12-c29462d32f97","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ADT08.
