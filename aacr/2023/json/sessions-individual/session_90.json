The relatively new field of inquiry has explored how we consistently demonstrate a preference for the present-time and the status quo, but also how behavioral interventions can harness these insights to align with long-term goals. Behavioral economics has recently been applied to health care, evaluating how nudges, or changes in choice architecture, can help guide patients and clinicians towards behaviors that improve health outcomes. In this session, we will provide a background in behavioral economic principles and show how behavioral nudges have been designed and evaluated across the cancer care continuum including screening, diagnosis, treatment, and end-of-life care. We will also explore practical considerations such as partnering with clinical operations, leveraging the electronic health record and other technologies, implementing pragmatic trials, and scaling interventions that are shown to be effective.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"90","Key":"e696357f-7f36-4326-a458-aa6c198c8fea","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W307 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"APS03","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Population Sciences","PrimaryCategory_keys":"aac4f922-9142-438f-8cca-8bd13134a497","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"APS03.
