Cellular senescence is like a double-edged sword for cancer. On the one hand, loss of proliferative capacity of senescent cells appears to prevent the accumulation of genomic and epigenomic aberrant cells, thus acting as a barrier to tumorigenesis. On the other hand, senescent cells secrete a variety of inflammatory cytokines and form chronic microinflammation in the surrounding microenvironment, promoting carcinogenesis, malignancy, resistance to tumor immunity, and metastasis. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between cellular senescence and cancer will not only lead to a better understanding of the basic mechanisms of carcinogenesis and malignant transformation, but also to the establishment of new and innovative cancer therapies targeting senescent cells.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 9:30:00 AM","EndTime":"09:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"141","Key":"09905025-487b-4299-b428-117bbb95fc5a","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 1 (WF1) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED044","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED044.
