The impact of modifiable factors such as exercise on cancer outcomes are of great interest to the medical community and to patients. National guidelines have embraced exercise as cancer medicine. As we continue to elucidate the mechanisms by which exercise impacts cancer outcomes, and the magnitude of benefit that can be conferred, the evidence continues to support the incorporation of exercise from diagnosis through extended survivorship. Resistance and aerobic exercise can impact both treatment-related complications and cancer prognosis. This session will focus on the mechanisms by which exercise impacts cancer outcomes as well as the specific benefits related to resistance and aerobic exercise.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/14\/2023 6:15:00 PM","EndTime":"18:15","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"134","Key":"e3865db5-717f-4233-9d49-db34c3aaef7a","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W331 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED037","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Survivorship","PrimaryCategory_keys":"d4420fd5-7e0d-47e8-ab1c-0e3b22287219","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED037.
