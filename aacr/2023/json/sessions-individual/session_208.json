Tobacco use causes approximately 20 percent of all cancer cases and 30 percent of all cancer deaths across more than 18 types of cancer. While the U.S. adult cigarette smoking rate is at a historic low of 12.5 percent, further significant reductions are necessary in order to achieve the Moonshot&rsquo;s goal of halving the cancer death rate in 25 years. Following the reignition of the Cancer Moonshot in 2022, FDA unveiled draft regulations that would prohibit menthol-flavored cigarettes and all flavors of cigars, and FDA is now working to finalize these important rules. Additionally, FDA announced it would propose a new regulation to limit the amount of nicotine allowed in cigarettes and certain other combustible tobacco products to minimally addictive levels. During this session, Brian King, PhD, MPH, the Director of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&rsquo;s (FDA) Center for Tobacco Products will share FDA&rsquo;s priorities for addressing tobacco product use and join a discussion with experts from AACR&rsquo;s Tobacco Products and Cancer Subcommittee.&nbsp;<\/p>\u000a","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/17\/2023 4:00:00 PM","EndTime":"16:00","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"208","Key":"5c2c7b89-38d7-4b44-801d-3854cdea901f","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W330 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"DC03","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Science and Health Policy","PrimaryCategory_keys":"fca78713-7481-4446-b905-872548fec7be","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"DC03.
