They and are essential in fighting infections and aid in wound healing. In recent years, there has been a growing appreciation for the diverse functions of neutrophils in cancer. Experimental data from mouse models have shown that neutrophils can both negatively and positively affect tumor progression: On one hand, neutrophils can be potent killers of cancer cells, but on the other hand, they can also have immune suppressive, pro-angiogenic, and pro-metastatic functions.   This educational session will include presentations that discuss how neutrophils alter the tumor microenvironment and the mechanisms by which they regulate metastasis and responses to therapy, including immunotherapy. A better understanding of the roles of neutrophils in cancer is likely to provide opportunities for using them as clinical biomarkers, for therapeutic targeting of their anti-metastatic effects, and for harnessing of their immunomodulatory functions.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/15\/2023 11:30:00 AM","EndTime":"11:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"127","Key":"9fd3f304-82f3-4c32-bfdb-973dcce0e6ed","LastUpdated":"2023-03-30 23:19","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Valencia BC - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED036","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Immunology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"bd4b7f63-21dc-4421-a11e-628f36cc56fe","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED036.
