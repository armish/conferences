PDOs are used in standard preclinical drug screening for target validation and lead selection as well as in co-clinical approaches where clinical trials in a dish are performed to stratify responders and non-responders and identify predictive biomarkers. Here we show how PDOs have contributed to successful development of oncology and immuno-oncology agents currently in clinical trials after significantly shortened developmental timelines, and propose they will take centre stage in drug development by replacing standard preclinical models for faster, cost-efficient, and successful pipelines.","Duration":60,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/16\/2023 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"574","Key":"b707982d-e481-47ef-9be5-71fb09538132","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Spotlight Theater D","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":"<p>HUB Organoids<\/p>\u000d\u000a","Number":"ESP02D","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"","PrimaryCategory_keys":"","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Complete","SearchResultBody":"ESP02D.
