The aim of this session is to highlight new discoveries that describe adaptations and stress response pathways that are co-opted to promote survival and tumor progression in response to intrinsic and extrinsic stress. Speakers will cover topics including how tumor and associated cells manipulate stress response pathways to adapt to hypoxia, oxidative and metabolic stress. In addition, the presenters will discuss how these adaptations can influence response to anti-cancer therapies and how manipulation of these pathways can be harnessed to uncover therapeutic vulnerabilities.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/14\/2023 4:30:00 PM","EndTime":"16:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"146","Key":"38526987-cebd-40d1-aa0e-63ace0f13d13","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Tangerine Ballroom 3-4 (WF3-4) - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED047","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED047.
