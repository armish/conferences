Indeed, by 2030 global cancer deaths are projected to be near 25 Million.  Most countries in sub-Saharan African remained unprepared to address this rising burden and face disproportionately higher cancer-related morbidity and mortality, due to inadequate screening and prevention (early detection), treatment and palliative care capacity. To address this rising tide of cancer, cost-effective and innovative interventions in screening, and treatment must be delivered via strengthened health systems to improve outcomes, reduce suffering, and reduce healthcare disparities. Nonetheless, the development, evaluation, implementation and dissemination of new treatments and technologies requires both research and healthcare infrastructure for safe, rigorous and effective validation and translation into communities. An expert panel of physicians from the US and sub-Saharan Africa will discuss these challenges and opportunities of intervention.","Duration":0,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/19\/2023 11:45:00 AM","EndTime":"11:45","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"47","Key":"f0238667-ac4a-4dc3-a6bb-40ddef9ecd3c","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W311 E-H - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY36","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Global Health","PrimaryCategory_keys":"4dcc426d-9797-4f74-a832-13f84c2678eb","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY36.
