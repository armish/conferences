The persistence of cancer mortality inequities is alarming and has prompted novel research to investigate the contribution of social determinants of health and biological factors &ndash; and sociobiologic mechanisms &ndash; that may help explain why these inequities exist: 1) Allostatic load &ndash; a measure of cumulative physiological stress and burden across major regulatory systems &ndash; is an indicator of adverse health outcomes and can serve as a multidimensional indicator of the body&rsquo;s responses to chronic stressors. Allostatic load is significantly associated with race and ethnicity and other social determinants of health and is emerging as a potential risk factor for cancer. 2) Genetic ancestry &ndash; defined by germline variants that are preferentially found in certain populations have been investigated and found to associate with differential gene expression levels. Genetic ancestry is significantly associated with higher expression of DNA repair-associated genes. Higher levels of expression of DNA repair genes have been observed in many cancer types and are associated with reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. This session will discuss recent evidence connecting allostatic load with poorer outcomes among Black women and the potential for modifying allostatic load as a means of cancer risk reduction. We will also discuss recent evidence connecting genetic ancestry and poorer outcomes among head and neck cancer patients and the potential for alternative therapeutic approaches to improve survival.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/16\/2023 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"97","Key":"acba490c-bda5-41f2-80ed-fd367e278b54","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W304 A-D - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ASD03","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Cancer Disparities","PrimaryCategory_keys":"8f20dc38-c27e-4e8a-8013-6a339e738e57","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ASD03.
