Age-stratified outcomes have been observed across many adult cancers and in many cases, older patients suffer worse outcomes than younger patients. Emerging evidence indicates that age-related processes ultimately impact cancer initiation, progression, treatment tolerability, and therapeutic responses. The speakers in this major symposium will discuss current understanding of age-related processes and their impact on cancer. This session will also challenge the community to ask whether we need age-stratified treatment approaches to tackle cancer.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/16\/2023 2:30:00 PM","EndTime":"14:30","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"73","Key":"ba386a45-c6be-4553-bf2e-a0cc99c38c95","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Room W414 - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"SY24","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Tumor Biology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"f61e2425-32f2-4ae5-b93b-257e2b5f2b7a","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"SY24.
