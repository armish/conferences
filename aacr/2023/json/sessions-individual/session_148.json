This is especially for immunologically cold tumors, which are characterized by either poor T cell entry in the tumor (so-called desert pattern) or by T cell accumulation in the peri-tumoral stroma (excluded pattern).  In this session, we will discuss several tumor-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms involved in keeping T cells away from their tumor targets, including the lack of tumor cell recognition by T cells, as well as the physical\/chemical constraints imposed by the surrounding stromal cells. Therapeutic strategies to counteract this exclusion phenomenon will be discussed.","Duration":90,"EmbargoSessionContentRule":null,"EmbargoSessionContentUntil":null,"End":"4\/14\/2023 6:15:00 PM","EndTime":"18:15","HidePresentationRating":"False","HidePresentations":"False","Id":"148","Key":"3ddabea6-2f34-46d0-932d-a67dbd3db9ff","LastUpdated":"2023-03-23 07:47","LimitCMEToRegistrationCodes":null,"LimitMediaToRegistrationCodes":null,"Location":"Chapin Theater - Convention Center","MediaSource":"None","MediaSourceDetails":null,"MediaSourceDuration":null,"MediaSourceDurationHMS":null,"Notes":null,"Number":"ED049","OnDemand":"False","OwnerKey":null,"PlayerUrl":null,"PlayerUrlReason":null,"PrimaryCategory":"Immunology","PrimaryCategory_keys":"bd4b7f63-21dc-4421-a11e-628f36cc56fe","PrimaryMediaItemId":null,"PrimaryMediaItemKey":null,"RuleStatus":"Incomplete","SearchResultBody":"ED049.
